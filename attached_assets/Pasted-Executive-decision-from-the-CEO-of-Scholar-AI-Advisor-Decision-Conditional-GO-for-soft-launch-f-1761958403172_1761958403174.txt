Executive decision from the CEO of Scholar AI Advisor

Decision: Conditional GO for soft launch (first 10–20 customers), contingent on public production verification across three gates within 60 minutes:

scholar_auth: JWKS must return valid RS256 JWKs at https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/jwks.json
scholarship_api: /canary must return v2.7 JSON (8 fields) at https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/canary
student_pilot: End-to-end OIDC login, profile load, and recommendations request must succeed on production URLs
Why conditional: Several verifications you shared were localhost-only. I need proof from the public app_base_url endpoints before we flip on external traffic. Once those three pass, proceed with the limited soft launch using auto_com_center in dry-run/manual fallback mode.

Immediate actions and owners

Auth (scholar_auth) – DRI: Auth Lead

Target: JWKS GREEN on public URL in ≤30 minutes.
Do now:
Force production rebuild and invalidate cache in Replit Deployments.
If cache persists >15 minutes, create a new production deployment (fresh URL), publish, and immediately propagate the new JWKS URL to all services (scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, student_pilot, provider_register, auto_com_center, scholarship_agent).
Verify: curl -s https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/jwks.json | jq . Must return “keys” array with kid, kty=“RSA”, alg=“RS256”, use=“sig”, n, e.
Acceptance: 200 OK, valid JSON; no HTML, no redirects, no 5xx.
API (scholarship_api) – DRI: API Lead

Target: Publish v2.7 to production in ≤15 minutes.
Verify:
Canary schema: curl -s https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/canary | jq . Expected 8 fields exactly: app, app_base_url, version, status, p95_ms, security_headers, dependencies_ok, timestamp; version="v2.7"; status="ok".
Security headers: curl -I https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/canary Expect 6/6: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.
RBAC spot-checks return 401/403 on protected routes without valid JWT.
Acceptance: All pass; HTTP 200 on /canary.
Student Pilot (student_pilot) – DRI: Frontend Lead

Target: Smoke E2E success in ≤30 minutes after Auth/API green.
Verify:
Login → callback → session established (HttpOnly cookie or secure storage) and /api/auth/user=200.
Scholarship list renders via scholarship_api.
Recommendations fetched from scholarship_sage and displayed.
Basic accessibility: no blocking contrast or keyboard traps on primary paths.
Metrics to capture and post: page load (ttfb), API p95, auth success rate.
Scholarship Sage (scholarship_sage) – DRI: Sage Lead

Status: Approved GREEN for participation.
Actions:
Stand by to serve recommendations for student_pilot smoke and soft launch.
Prepare T+7d A/B experiment (essay-NLP signals) but do not enable during first 48 hours.
Provider Register (provider_register) – DRI: B2B Portal Lead

Status: Ready with caveats acknowledged.
Action (T+2h): Reduce health-check timeouts to 500 ms and make dependency checks async so /canary p95 ≤120 ms.
Begin limited B2B onboarding when Auth/API are GREEN; continue using production-billing page with 3% disclosure.
Auto Page Maker (auto_page_maker) – DRI: SEO Lead

Action (T+24h latest, prefer T+8h): Generate and publish 50 high-intent landing pages with schema.org metadata and canonical tags. Confirm trigger on new/updated scholarships from scholarship_api.
Auto Com Center (auto_com_center) – DRI: Comms Lead

Launch mode: Dry-run + manual fallback ON for first 10–20 customers.
T+24h: Wire up transactional provider (e.g., Postmark/SendGrid), keep unsubscribe management verified, and start capturing bounce/complaint rates.
Scholarship Agent (scholarship_agent) – DRI: Ops Automation Lead

Action: Confirm M2M token with SystemService role; verify event emission to auto_com_center for “deadline approaching” and “new match” events with retry + circuit breaker.
Verification to post back before GO

Paste the exact outputs of these three commands (public URLs only):

JWKS: curl -s https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/jwks.json | jq .
API canary: curl -s https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/canary | jq .
Student Pilot auth check (after login, from browser devtools or a curl with session): GET https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/auth/user ⇒ 200 with current user JSON
If all pass, I authorize opening the soft launch funnel to the first cohort immediately.

Soft launch guardrails (first 48 hours)

SLOs
Platform API p95 ≤120 ms; alert if >250 ms for 10 minutes.
student_pilot auth success rate ≥98%.
auto_com_center DLQ ≤1%; if exceeded for 10 minutes, pause outbound automations.
Rollback triggers
JWKS errors >2% across services or sustained 5xx on scholar_auth ≥5 minutes → Freeze new logins, serve status page, initiate hotfix.
scholarship_api 5xx >1% or RBAC bypass detected → Disable write operations until fixed.
Critical UX outage on student_pilot (login or dashboard) >5 minutes → Route to maintenance banner and restrict to read-only.
Comms policy
Keep auto_com_center in dry-run/manual fallback until T+24h metrics reviewed; no promotional sends; transactional only.
Lifecycle and revenue cessation acceptance

auto_com_center: Infrastructure, 5–7 years (accepted).
provider_register: User-facing, 3–4 years (accepted).
scholarship_sage: Intelligence/Automation, 2–3 years (accepted).
scholarship_api: Infrastructure, 5–7 years (accepted once deployed).
scholar_auth: Infrastructure, 5–7 years; reassess on OAuth/JWT standard shifts or PQC migration window.
student_pilot and auto_page_maker: Submit Section 7 lifecycle analyses by EOD today, aligned to 3–4 years (UI) and 2–3 years (automation/SEO engine) respectively.
KPIs to report during soft launch

B2C: free→paid conversion, ARPU from credits, recommendation CTR, app-start to submission rate.
B2B: active providers onboarded, listings created, applications per listing, 3% fee accrual.
Reliability: per-app p95, uptime, error rates; DLQ size; auth failure rate.
SEO: number of indexed landing pages, impressions, CTR (Auto Page Maker).
Capital allocation and priorities (next 7 days)

Priority 1: Organic growth. Auto Page Maker at full throttle (within safe indexing guidelines) to expand low-CAC acquisition.
Priority 2: Harden Auth/API and finish latency optimizations to consistently hit ≤120 ms p95.
Priority 3: Provider onboarding playbook and first invoices (ensure 3% fee visibility and SOC2-lite controls).
Final note

I will not authorize paid acquisition until we confirm organic conversion and unit economics for the first cohort.
Act with urgency. Post the three public verification outputs above. If the auth cache issue persists beyond 15 minutes, execute the new-deployment URL fallback immediately. Once the three gates are GREEN on the public URLs, you have GO to begin revenue.
