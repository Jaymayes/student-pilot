Recommendation: Prioritize B2B Outreach for near-term revenue while starting light-weight Content Injection in parallel. Outreach converts now (inventory + 3% fee), and content begins compounding SEO. Don’t wait on one for the other—sequence them for speed.

What to do next (72-hour plan)

B2B Outreach (primary)

A6 (Provider_register) — today
Concierge outreach: Book 3×15‑min sessions (DonorFoundation, Protocol Verification Provider, Jamarr’s Org). Use fresh Stripe Connect links at call start.
Goal by T+48h: 2/3 provider_connected; by T+72h: 3 listings live.
In-app friction removal: Keep the “Complete Stripe Setup” banner and Impact Preview widget; ensure POST /api/stripe/connect/onboard works from dashboard.
A8 (Auto_com_center) — today
Alerts: provider_connected (page if 0 by T+24h); listing_created (ticket if 0 by T+72h).
Evidence: capture message_id for each outreach and track provider_connected, listing_created events on a live tile.
A3 (Scholarship_agent) — parallel, 24h
If SendGrid credits allow, send a single low‑volume “You’re one step away” nudge to existing providers (CTA → A6). If not, skip email and rely on concierge + in‑app.
Success metrics (72h)
≥2 provider_connected; ≥3 listings live; first GMV event created (fee_captured to follow with payouts).
Content Injection (secondary, parallel)

A7 (Auto_page_maker) — today
Submit sitemap in GSC (apex) and verify “Redirected” status for a www URL. Start a 100‑page/day cadence focused on high‑intent clusters:
State × Major pairs (e.g., Nursing in TX, Engineering in CA, CS in NY).
Ensure apex canonical, FAQ schema, and internal links from /majors and /states hubs; confirm single‑hop www→apex; no chained redirects.
A8 — today
Add a GSC tile (impressions/clicks/CTR) and an Index Coverage tile (total indexed URLs) to the dashboard.
Success metrics (7 days)
+500 pages generated, ≥100 indexed URLs, first GSC clicks attributable to apex; A8 tiles reflecting UTM=auto_page_maker conversions into A5.
B2C conversion hygiene (keep warm)

A5 (Student_pilot): Maintain /api/login p95 ≤200ms; trial credits grant on signup; checkout recovery nudge enabled.
A4 (Scholarship_sage): Credits badge + paywall live; prompt purchase after first value moment.
Decision gates (what I’ll report)

Wed 20:00 UTC: If no provider_connected for targeted providers, queue T+48h final reminders (fresh Stripe links; 1/24h cap; suppression honored).
T+72h: If no listing_created, escalate to phone outreach + live walk‑through.
T+7d: If <100 indexed URLs or no GSC clicks, run a “Top 100” manual URL inspection and review errors; add internal linking from category hubs.
Your single approval needed

Approve immediate concierge outreach (calls + links) and the 100‑page/day SEO cadence. I’ll coordinate monitoring in A8 and post a daily pulse on:
provider_connected, listing_created, fee_captured
pages generated, indexed, GSC clicks
A5 conversion p50/p95 and trial→paid funnel
If bandwidth is constrained and you want only one track first, pick B2B Outreach. It converts to revenue fastest; SEO will keep building in the background once the sitemap is re‑submitted.
