Excellent work. Acknowledge containment success. We remain in production freeze. Now drive to full verification and the T+48 Unfreeze Review.

Immediate directives (do these next, in order)

0. Finish error-handling coverage (target: 20 minutes)

Complete try/catch + rollback + transient retry for:
calculateChargeMillicredits
applyLedgerEntry
chargeForUsage
Tests: add unit/property tests for rounding in millicredits; fault-injection proving rollback/no partial writes; idempotency verified on retries.
Rebuild and re-scan (start immediately after 0 is done)
Fresh build: regenerate dist artifacts; no secrets baked; confirm public-only config in client.
Scans: run secret scanners on repo + new dist; run SAST (SQL patterns) and negative SQLi tests; post all reports.
Keys: confirm all rotated secrets and session invalidations complete; document rotation log; purge CDN caches again post-rebuild.
2. Access control and WAF hardening (keep in place until unfreeze)

Confirm /api/billing/balance requires auth + authorization scope; contract tests attached (401/403 unauth; 200 only for authorized).
Keep WAF rules blocking unauthenticated billing paths and common SQLi payloads through review window; attach WAF hit metrics.
3. Verification and dashboards (kick off within 1 hour)

Rerun complete qa-comprehensive-execution-report.json; produce delta summary.
Dashboards live: auth abuse (blocked + FP), reconciliation deltas ($0), endpoint contract health, SSR error rate, p95 latency, error budget.
Billing recon: run 24h test-mode reconciliation; prove $0 deltas; show idempotency adherence.
4. CI/CD guardrails (lock now)

Enforce gates: eval ban, SQL string-concat ban, secret scans (repo + dist), and PII-log scrub checks must block merges to main.
Add “throwaway” branch proofs that each gate fails as intended; attach CI logs.
Timeline and checkpoints

+30 minutes: Error handling complete; tests passing; post diff and test evidence.
+2 hours: Fresh build produced; secret scans (repo + dist) = 0; SAST clean; WAF rules active with metrics.
+4 hours: Full verification suite rerun posted; dashboards live; reconciliation $0; access control tests attached.
Unfreeze path (unchanged)

Pre-read package at T+36 with single link to all artifacts (verification rerun, delta summary, scans, rotation log, CI gate proofs, WAF metrics, dashboards, reconciliation, feature-flag inventory, build SHA/artifact hash, environment inventory).
T+48 Unfreeze Review (CEO-chaired) and Go/No-Go per the matrix.
Risk posture (until review)

Maintain SEV status and WAF hardening until secret scans clean (repo + dist) and access control tests verified.
Any regression on auth, secrets, or SQLi triggers immediate freeze escalation.
What I need posted in the exec channel at the next checkpoint

30-minute update: “Error handling complete” with test IDs and screenshots/logs.
2-hour update: New dist hash + scan reports (0 findings), SAST report, WAF metrics snapshot.
4-hour update: Verification rerun results, live dashboard links, reconciliation $0 proof, and endpoint contract test results.
Quality over speed remains the rule. Execute this sequence and prepare the T+36 pre-read.
