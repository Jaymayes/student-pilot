Executive Decision from the CEO of Scholar AI Advisor
Prime directive reminder: every go-live decision is judged by its impact on the 5‑year path to $10M profitable ARR, with student value and low-CAC SEO growth as the primary levers.

Summary decision

Overall program: NO-GO as a whole today. Evidence is not verifiably accessible; ownership is unclear; several critical risk and compliance gates remain unresolved.
Conditional exceptions:
auto_page_maker: PROVISIONAL GO (keep live but frozen). This is our lowest-risk, highest-ROI organic engine; protecting it preserves our low-CAC strategy while we harden the rest of the stack. Maintain current freeze and daily SEO rollups; no new page generation until evidence is published and verified. This aligns with our API-as-a-product and phased-rollout governance standards and preserves our organic flywheel .
Why this decision

Evidence accessibility: The reports reference local workspace files and non-resolvable paths. As CEO, I cannot accept “local-only” evidence. We require web-accessible, checksummed artifacts per Section V.
Ownership drift: Agent3 claims multiple apps in conflicting statements. We operate with single DRI per app; no scope creep.
Risk posture: Email deliverability/DKIM, payments (Stripe), privacy/DSAR, age gating, and auth SLO confirmations are not fully verified via accessible evidence. Our standards demand API-as-a-product discipline and phased, monitor-first rollouts with HOTL controls before enabling any automated campaigns or regulated data flows .
Immediate CEO directives (timeboxed)
In the next 2 hours (hard deadline), Agent3 must do the following for exactly one app you own. If you are not the DRI for any app, reply immediately tagging the correct DRI.

Confirm single-app ownership
Reply in Section V header format: APPLICATION NAME: {exact app name} APP_BASE_URL: {exact base URL}
2. Publish an evidence bundle (accessible via HTTPS)

On your app, expose:
GET /api/evidence → JSON index of all evidence items (title, purpose, timestamp UTC, size, SHA‑256, URL)
Static file route /evidence/{path} → serve each artifact
GET /openapi.json and /docs (or equivalent) for API-as-a-product standards
Do not link local paths. All links must resolve over HTTPS. Integrity must be provable via SHA‑256. This is consistent with our API governance expectations .
3. Submit a concise Section V status report for that one app (CEO format)
Include only app-relevant content. Keep it brief and verifiable.

Header: APPLICATION NAME: {app} APP_BASE_URL: {url} Status: GO-LIVE READY | DELAYED | CONDITIONAL GO
Evidence links (URLs + SHA‑256) for:
Security & compliance: MFA/SSO/RBAC, TLS/HSTS, encryption at rest, audit logging, HOTL controls
Performance & reliability: uptime, P95 latency target ≤120ms, error rate, DR plan, backup cadence, monitoring endpoints (/health, /metrics)
Integration: end-to-end flows with request_id lineage; OpenAPI published
Testing: functional, security, performance, UAT; integration with dependent apps
Deployment: rollout plan, 5‑minute rollback playbook, dev vs prod separation
Student value/KPIs: how this app advances “First Document Upload” activation and growth KPIs tied to our revised roadmap and MAU/ARR targets
Blockers with owners, resolution timestamps, and exact go-live date/time.
Gate criteria and next decisions

scholar_auth: NO-GO until P95 ≤120ms and audit/retention + SSO/MFA evidence are accessible via HTTPS endpoints. Publish /api/evidence, /openapi.json, /metrics. Use phased rollout and observer-first where applicable .
scholarship_api: NO-GO until DSAR endpoints and evidence are published, with HOTL and explainability in decision logs. API-as-a-product docs must be live and versioned; evidence must demonstrate request_id lineage E2E .
provider_register: NO-GO until Stripe Gate B evidence is accessible (webhooks signature verification, deterministic 3% fee, refund flows) and finance sign-off link is published.
auto_com_center: NO-GO for outbound sends until DKIM/DMARC/SPF alignment evidence is accessible. Observer mode only; no student-funnel disruption. Use phased enablement with immediate rollback runbook .
scholarship_agent: Observer-only until HOTL gates and fairness telemetry evidence are accessible; no autonomous sends. Follow monitor→limited enablement→scale sequencing with explicit governance artifacts .
student_pilot: NO-GO until age-gate, ToS/Privacy sign-off, and UAT evidence are published; show “First Document Upload” activation funnel metrics and error budgets.
scholarship_sage: May remain live as a read-only observer if evidence endpoints and rollup integrity are published; fairness telemetry can go live after evidence review.
Infrastructure guardrails (Replit)

Select the correct deployment mode per app (Autoscale for bursty public APIs, Reserved VM for always-on auth and critical backends, Static for SEO pages). Publish the mode and cost controls in your Section V report. This is essential for reliability and unit economics .
Strategic alignment and KPIs to surface in every report

Activation: “First Document Upload” is the north-star activation metric and must be traceable in evidence and dashboards. Incorporate the revised roadmap focus on integrating Essay Coach signals into matching for “implicit fit” to unlock conversion lift and ARPU expansion .
Growth engine: Prioritize zero/low-CAC SEO from auto_page_maker. Any action that jeopardizes CWV or indexation is a hard stop. Surface MAU, conversion, ARPU, and provider growth by cohort in scholarship_sage rollups aligned to the 5‑year plan milestones .
Responsible AI and governance: HOTL, explainability, auditability, and fairness monitoring are required before autonomy is enabled in any user-impacting workflow. Start in observer mode, then supervised autonomy, then controlled expansion only after evidence-backed trust is established .
What I need from Agent3 now (2-hour deadline)

Confirm exactly one app you own.
Publish the evidence API and static file URLs for that app.
Post a single Section V report, with only verifiable links and checksums.
Propose a precise go-live timestamp window and gate criteria for a CEO GO/NO-GO.
Once your corrected evidence is accessible, I will issue app-level GO/NO-GO decisions immediately. Protect the student experience and the SEO flywheel above all else; this is the most capital-efficient path to our ARR target .
