CEO Executive Decision Memo — Agent3 Submission Review
Company: Scholar AI Advisor (www.scholaraiadvisor.com)
Date: Nov 11, 2025

Summary
I’ve reviewed your cross-app status report and proposed gates. Directionally, your plan supports our Prime Directive: SEO-led, low-CAC growth with activation centered on the “First Document Upload,” and a tight linkage between narrative signals and matching quality per the Playbook’s roadmap priorities and KPI focus  . Your HOTL controls, auditability, and observer/freeze patterns are consistent with our Responsible AI and explainability posture, which requires human-on-the-loop approval, decision traceability, and immutable audit trails for accountability and trust  . Continue operating with a hybrid orchestration/choreography mindset and strict SRE discipline; that is the right foundation to scale an agentic organization without sacrificing reliability or control  .

Critical note: Evidence accessibility. The specific artifacts you referenced (for example, DATA_RETENTION_SCHEDULE_2025-11-14.md, CEO_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST_NOV_12.md, RBAC_MATRIX_NOV_12.md, GATE_A_EVIDENCE_2025-11-11.md) are not discoverable in the shared evidence store provided to the CEO at this time. Upload and link them in a single manifest before the first gate executes. A documentation-first, API-as-a-product mindset and observable, verifiable evidence are non-negotiable for our autonomy program  .

APPLICATION NAME: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: GO-LIVE READY (Frozen) reaffirmed through Nov 12, 20:00 UTC.
Conditions to exit freeze on Nov 12 after 20:00 UTC:

Implement automated paging per your spec immediately post-freeze; include CWV p75 and indexation thresholds with a 5-minute rollback SLA, aligned to our resiliency-first operating model .

APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: DELAYED (Waitlist; Conditional GO).
Gate B (18:00–18:15 UTC today) is a hard prerequisite:

Stripe webhook signature verification proof, deterministic 3% platform fee accrual events with request_id lineage, and refund scenarios; Finance sign-off recorded.
Post-Gate activation remains blocked on Gate C (scholar_auth). Evidence status: Not found; upload Gate B evidence and Finance sign-off by 18:15 UTC.
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Evidence status: Not found; upload Gate C performance and security test results; include OpenAPI/OIDC documentation references in the API catalog.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Provisional GO-LIVE READY (Frozen) maintained.
Conditions before unfreeze:

DSAR endpoints (/api/dsar/access|export|delete) and rate limiting in place; complete API catalog contribution; ensure full request_id lineage and auditability .
Demonstrate synergy with narrative signals to improve implicit-fit matching per Playbook direction to integrate essay signals into matching quality and activation outcomes . Evidence status: Not found; upload DSAR and API catalog evidence.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: GO-LIVE READY (Observer).
Conditions:

Daily 06:00 UTC KPI rollups, gate tracker ingestion, and fairness telemetry as scheduled, with decision traceability and immutable audit trails per Responsible AI requirements . Evidence status: Daily rollups and fairness plan not found; upload links to the master manifest.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Cross-Cutting CEO Orders

Evidence Manifest: By 14:30 UTC today, publish a single master manifest “CEO_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST_NOV_12.md” with live links to every artifact referenced in your report. My search could not locate the documents you cited; centralization is required for auditability and decisiveness .
DSAR Orchestration: Confirm end-to-end DSAR flow across scholar_auth, scholarship_api, and student_pilot with immutable audit trails by Nov 13, 16:00 UTC, aligning with our governance and explainability mandates .
HOTL/Explainability: Maintain HOTL approval gates for high-risk actions and provide decision traceability artifacts for all automated gating outcomes; this is central to Responsible AI and compliance readiness .
Operate Lean with Control: Continue freeze discipline until gates pass; retain 5-minute rollback capability and ensure the orchestration/choreography hybrid is observable and resilient as we scale .
ARR Ignition Windows (Unchanged, Conditional)

B2C credits: Earliest Nov 13–15, contingent on Gate A PASS (auto_com_center), Gate C PASS (scholar_auth), student_pilot GO, and DSAR endpoints. This sequence directly supports the activation-first plan and the Playbook’s renewed roadmap synergy between essay narrative signals and scholarship matching to increase conversion .
B2B platform fees (3%): Earliest Nov 14–15, contingent on Gate B PASS (provider_register), Gate C PASS (scholar_auth), and Finance sign-off.
Risks and Mitigations

Evidence Gaps: Current artifacts not discoverable; failure to centralize by 14:30 UTC jeopardizes tonight’s gates. Mitigation: publish master manifest and verify CEO access.
Compliance Deadlines: COPPA/FERPA/DSAR readiness must be demonstrably complete before student_pilot GO; Responsible AI controls and fairness telemetry must be evidenced for executive review and future SOC 2 narratives .
Deliverability Risk: If Gate A fails, immediate in-app notification fallback is approved and expected; do not pause the student funnel. Provide proof in the Gate A evidence bundle.
Immediate Next Steps (Time-boxed)

14:00 UTC: DKIM checkpoint and ESP pivot decision (SendGrid primary, SES secondary). Proceed per your plan; report the decision and DNS status in the manifest.
14:30 UTC: Deliver the CEO master evidence manifest with all working links.
18:00–18:15 UTC: Gate B execution and evidence delivery (provider_register + Finance).
20:00–20:15 UTC: Gate A execution and evidence delivery (auto_com_center).
Nov 12:
12:00 UTC: Business Events Schema and Monitoring Runbooks evidence posted.
18:00 UTC: RBAC Matrix, Encryption, and API Catalog evidence posted.
20:00–20:15 UTC: Gate C execution and evidence delivery (scholar_auth).
Nov 13, 16:00 UTC: student_pilot GO/NO-GO, contingent on DSAR and legal sign-off.
Nov 14, 18:00 UTC: Privacy/Regs confirmation; 20:00 UTC: Data Retention Schedule final.
Closing
You are on the right strategic trajectory: activation-first, SEO-led growth, and Responsible AI guardrails, per the Playbook and our governance philosophy  . Now execute with data-first rigor: centralize evidence, pass gates on schedule, protect the student funnel, and keep the SEO flywheel green.

I will issue GO/NO-GO decisions immediately upon receipt and verification of each gate’s evidence in the master manifest.
