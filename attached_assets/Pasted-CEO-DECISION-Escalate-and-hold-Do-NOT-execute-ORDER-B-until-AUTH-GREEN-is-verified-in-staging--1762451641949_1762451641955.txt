CEO DECISION: Escalate and hold. Do NOT execute ORDER_B until AUTH_GREEN is verified in staging.

Rationale

Evidence-first principle: We have a hard “invalid_client” from scholar_auth; claims of clearance without a passing authorize→consent→code→token flow are not sufficient.
Risk: Proceeding will burn time, block evidence, and jeopardize the Nov 9 ramp and Nov 12 ARR ignition.
Immediate orders (effective now)

scholar_auth — FIX AND PROVE AUTH_GREEN (Owner: Auth DRI)
Deadline: T+20 minutes for a working flow; absolute cutoff 19:00 UTC for today’s validation plan.
Required fixes:
Register or re-register provider_register client correctly.
Whitelist all staging redirect_uris actually in use (include current replit domain variants seen in error logs).
Enforce PKCE S256; ensure correct client type (public vs confidential) aligned with provider_register.
Evidence to deliver to all dependents:
Updated CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT with SHA-256 fingerprint and timestamp.
OIDC smoke test proof:
GET .well-known openid-configuration (200 OK)
/authorize returns consent (screenshot) for provider_register
/token exchanges code→tokens (log with redacted tokens)
refresh_token works; revocation works (200 OK)
Copy of exact redirect_uri used during the passing test.
If not green by 19:00 UTC:
Declare AUTH RED for today’s chain; we will shift the Nov 9 ramp decision accordingly at 21:15 UTC.
2. provider_register — STAND BY; PREP TO EXECUTE ORDER_B ON AUTH_GREEN (Owner: Provider DRI)

Do not start ORDER_B until Auth DRI posts the above evidence.
Pre-stage two redirect_uris:
The stable app URL callback.
The current ephemeral staging callback in use.
Upon AUTH_GREEN: execute ORDER_B immediately and deliver ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md within 15 minutes (end-to-end auth→create scholarship→view dashboard).
3. student_pilot — HOLD E2E UNTIL AUTH_GREEN (Owner: Student DRI)

Maintain 10-minute SLA to run the 95-step E2E once Auth posts passing evidence.
Evidence pack must include cross-app request_id trace auth→api→ui→auto_com_center (internal only if DNS not green).
4. auto_com_center — CONTINUE EMAIL-ONLY; BLOCK EXTERNAL IF DNS NOT GREEN (Owner: Comms DRI)

If SPF/DKIM/DMARC not GREEN, block external sends; run internal loopbacks only.
Deliver STAGING_VALIDATION.md by 21:00 UTC; include Postmark deliverability checks, DLQ=0, P95 ≤120ms, unsubscribe ≤5s @100 conc.
5. scholarship_sage — SECRET DISCREPANCY (Owner: Sage DRI + Auth DRI)

Auth DRI: deliver M2M_SCHOLARSHIP_SAGE_SECRET to Sage env within T+30 minutes.
Sage: start 48h baseline immediately on receipt; report baseline start timestamp in the 21:15 UTC roll-up. Not on Nov 9 critical path, but must not slip past Nov 8 ~16:00 UTC.
6. scholarship_api and auto_page_maker — CONTINUE AS PLANNED

scholarship_api: ORDER_4 evidence received; maintain readiness and request_id propagation.
auto_page_maker: Stay staged for ORDER_4-driven generation; keep rollback guard armed, IndexNow success ≥95%, CWV p75 GREEN.
GO/NO-GO guardrails for today

If AUTH_GREEN achieved by 19:00 UTC and holds steady through ≥500 auth cycles (student_pilot + provider_register mix) with P95 ≤120ms and error rate <0.1%, we maintain the preliminary GO for the Nov 9 1% ramp.
If not, prepare a NO-GO recommendation for auth-dependent flows at 21:15 UTC; we will preserve SEO/non-auth workstreams and re-slot the ramp window.
Escalation protocol

This message constitutes the escalation. Auth is RED until evidence proves otherwise.
Any miss on the above deadlines triggers immediate page to CEO and an updated impact note on the 21:15 UTC roll-up.
Answer to your dilemma

Do not proceed with ORDER_B on trust. Wait for verified auth clearance and escalate (which we have now done). Execute ORDER_B immediately after AUTH_GREEN evidence is posted. This protects the Nov 9 ramp and Nov 12 ARR ignition while adhering to our evidence-first, low-CAC, Responsible AI operating model.
