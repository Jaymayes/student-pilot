CEO Executive Response — Operation Synergy (Hard Push to GREEN)

Acknowledgment

I have reviewed the full Agent3 directive and current war-room updates. Our single gating blocker is Gate 1 (scholar_auth Republish). All other services are staged or ready to execute within their SLAs once Gate 1 and Gate 2 go GREEN.
Executive Decisions and Timeboxed Escalation

Gate 1 (scholar_auth) — Decision Window: 15 minutes total
Required human action: Click Republish in Replit for scholar_auth.
Timebox:
T+0: Auth DRI clicks Republish.
T+5: Republish should complete.
T+10: Gate 1 verification results posted (JWKS, canary v2.7, security headers, P95 baseline).
T+15: If still RED or no human action, execute contingency EPD-Auth-01.
Authorization: EPD-Auth-01 is pre-approved if Republish is not completed within 15 minutes from now. Proceed automatically at T+15 unless I countermand.
2. Gate 2 (scholarship_api) — GO upon Gate 1 GREEN

Proceed with the staged deployment immediately when Gate 1 is GREEN.
Evidence bundle due within 15 minutes post-deploy:
/canary v2.7 JSON
6/6 security headers
RBAC 401/403 proof on protected routes
30-sample P95 ≤ 120ms
Rollback if any criterion fails. Notify war room and reattempt within the 30-minute SLA.
3. Gate 3 (student_pilot smoke) — GO within 15 minutes of Gate 2 GREEN

student_pilot DRI executes E2E smoke.
scholarship_sage joins to capture recommendation latency/accuracy.
auto_com_center runs in DRY-RUN mode (DISABLE_SEND=true); capture queue metrics and idempotency.
provider_register executes 5-minute verification and first-cohort enablement when Gate 2 turns GREEN.
Role Clarification and Immediate Ask

We must identify the Human Auth DRI now. A single point of failure will not persist.
Question to the room: Who has Replit access to scholar_auth and can click Republish in the next 5 minutes?
If no response in 5 minutes, assume EPD-Auth-01 will be needed at T+15.
Service-Specific CEO Directives

scholar_auth (Infrastructure): Critical Path

Human Auth DRI: Click Republish now. Announce “Republish started” then “Republish complete.”
Agent verifies immediately and posts 4 artifacts within 5 minutes.
If no Republish by T+15, execute EPD-Auth-01.
scholarship_api (Infrastructure): GO-on-Gate-1-GREEN

Deploy within minutes of Gate 1 GREEN.
Post evidence bundle; declare GREEN/RED within 20 minutes.
student_pilot (User Facing): Gate 3 Smoke

Complete auth journey, profile persistence, search, recommendations pull, application draft, and status display.
KPIs: auth success rate, P95 page transitions, 5xx rate, Lighthouse perf ≥70/accessibility ≥90.
Post HAR + screenshots + 30-sample P95.
scholarship_sage (Intelligence): Gate 3 Metrics

Capture ≥30 samples; P95 ≤ 120ms; ≥98% success rate.
Validate relevance and schema; post accuracy baseline in evidence bundle.
provider_register (User Facing): 5-Min Plan on Gate 2 GREEN

Verify explicit 3% platform fee disclosure.
Enforce RBAC tenant isolation; prove 401/403 on cross-tenant access.
Confirm API canary v2.7 and dependencies_ok.
Enable first provider cohort (10–20), confirm fee accrual tracking is active, and post evidence.
auto_com_center (Infrastructure): DRY-RUN Mode

Maintain DISABLE_SEND=true until Day-1 ramp.
During Gate 3 smoke: capture queue depth, enqueue-to-ack P95, idempotency, zero external sends proof.
Post evidence within 15-minute window.
auto_page_maker (Intelligence/Automation): Status Required

Report current trigger mechanism readiness (webhook/event-bus), template integrity, SEO metadata, and deployability.
Provide live page sample URL and confirm schema.org markup.
Interoperability and Compliance Guardrails (No exceptions)

Centralized auth: All services validate scholar_auth tokens (JWKS).
scholarship_api is source of truth; no shadow data stores.
HTTPS/TLS only; standardized JSON error format.
Compliance: FERPA/COPPA awareness, CAN-SPAM/GDPR for comms. Continue dry-run for comms until Day-1.
Section 7 Reports — Mandatory Format and Timing

Each DRI must submit their Section 7 report for their app when their gate turns GREEN, using the exact format provided in the directive. Include Lifecycle and Revenue Cessation Analysis aligned to app type:
Infrastructure: 5–7 years
User Facing: 3–4 years
Intelligence/Automation: 2–3 years
auto_com_center Section 7: Accepted. Status remains READY in DRY-RUN mode.
scholar_auth Section 7: Accepted with NOT READY flag until Republish or EPD-Auth-01 completes.
All other apps: Submit within 15 minutes of gate GREEN declaration.
Operational KPIs to Post During Hard Push

Platform SLOs: P95 ≤ 120ms; uptime 99.9%; 5xx rate < 0.5%
B2C funnel: auth success rate, time-to-first-value, recommendation latency/accuracy
B2B funnel: first cohort enabled (10–20 providers), listings/provider ≥ 2, 3% fee accrual active
Security: 6/6 headers on canary; RBAC verified; token validation logs present
Go/No-Go Criteria for Full Operational Capability (FOC)

Gate 1 GREEN with JWKS verified and canary v2.7 + headers + P95 evidence
Gate 2 GREEN with authorization middleware enforced and data flow verified
Gate 3 smoke completed with posted evidence bundles from student_pilot, scholarship_sage, auto_com_center, and provider_register
No critical/sev-1 incidents; comms remains DRY-RUN
CEO Actions Required From You Now

Identify the Human Auth DRI who can click Republish within 5 minutes.
If you are the Auth DRI, confirm “Republish started” now.
If not available, confirm authorization to execute EPD-Auth-01 at T+15.
I will hold the room to the timeboxes above. If Gate 1 does not go GREEN by T+15, EPD-Auth-01 executes. Keep the war-room cadence at 15-minute intervals until all three gates are GREEN and evidence bundles are posted.
