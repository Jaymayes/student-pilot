CEO DECISION MEMO — Gate A: Integration Readiness, Staging Validation, and Revenue Path

Executive stance

Mission lock: $10M profitable ARR in 5 years via AI-driven scholarship access; protect the SEO flywheel; keep P95 ≤120ms, error <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9%.
Evidence-first: No production ramps without auditable artifacts and request_id-correlated traces.
Go/No-Go decisions by application

scholar_auth — NO-GO for production; GO for timeboxed P0 resolution
Option A (primary): 90-minute deep-dive to eliminate invalid_client via adapter-based client lookup (fresh boot logs, adapter invocation proof, consent page render for provider-register). Produce P0_PASS_EVIDENCE.md on success.
Option B (fallback): If Option A fails, stand up a temporary staging IdP (Keycloak/Auth0) in 60 minutes with parity scopes, RBAC claims, and JWKS validation, then proceed with downstream staging tests. Deliver STAGING_IDP_PARITY_EVIDENCE.md.
Required now: Fresh startup logs proving clients removed from constructor and adapter path invoked; JWKS and RBAC claims examples; rate-limit evidence on auth endpoints.
scholarship_api — GO (staging), ARMED for Order 4
Execute Order 4 within 20 minutes of provider_register PASS. Emit scholarship_created events.
RDS migration plan remains due Nov 7, 22:00 UTC. Evidence: RDS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md (rollback, cutover, load tests).
scholarship_agent — GO (monitoring only)
No new actions. Ensure alerts for any staging-chain failures and human-in-the-loop escalation.
scholarship_sage — GO on secret; 48-hour observe-only baseline
Start immediately upon M2M secret receipt. Deliver baseline_metrics_evidence.md (+48h).
student_pilot — GO (staging)
Maintain SLOs; continue weekly cohort reporting. WCAG 2.1 AA remediation Sprint 2 (Nov 11–25) on schedule; publish final report on Nov 25.
provider_register — HOLD (await scholar_auth PASS)
On PASS, execute Order B within 20 minutes and publish ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md. Target pre-launch: 10–20 verified providers, 100–200 live listings.
auto_page_maker — GO, ARMED
+2 pages within 60 seconds of Order 4 trigger; evidence within 10 minutes. Guard P95 ≤120ms and CWV p75 GREEN.
auto_com_center — GO for staging validation upon secrets; PRODUCTION LOCKED
Execute Order #3 staging validation immediately after secrets. Production 1% ramp remains locked pending gate criteria below.
Production messaging gate (remains LOCKED)
Unlock 1% ramp requires:

DNS/A2P: SPF, DKIM, DMARC validated for mail.scholaraiadvisor.com; A2P brand/campaign approved with evidence.
scholar_auth stability: P0 PASS with evidence; no invalid_client regressions for 24h in staging.
auto_com_center staging validation: PASS with evidence bundle (unsubscribe SLA <5s; e2e P95 ≤120ms webhook→queue→worker→dispatcher→ESP; DLQ=0; Prometheus queue_depth; request_id tracing; 10 Postmark sandbox sends).
Centralized observability: Sentry traces correlated end-to-end via request_id across all 8 apps.
CEO explicit sign-off: Will issue after artifacts are posted and reviewed in a 30-minute war-room.
Immediate deliverables and owners (T+10 hard deadline)

Infra DRI
SENTRY_DSN (raw) distributed to all apps
AWS SQS + DLQ credentials/IAM for auto_com_center
Postmark and Twilio secrets in secrets manager
DNS evidence (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), A2P brand/campaign status or ETA
Publish: e2e/reports/infra/SECRETS_AND_DNS_EVIDENCE.md
Auth DRI
M2M secret for scholarship_sage; JWKS endpoint confirmation
Scholar_auth fresh boot logs verifying adapter-based client lookup
All DRIs
Confirm /health endpoint returns 200 with dependency checks
Confirm APP_NAME | APP_BASE_URL headers included in all artifacts
KPI guardrails and acceptance thresholds

P95 latency: ≤120ms end-to-end (auto_com_center staging pipeline; student_pilot ≤120ms; scholarship_api reads ≤120ms, writes ≤150ms)
Error rate: <0.1%
Uptime: ≥99.9%
SEO engine: Maintain CWV p75 GREEN (LCP/CLS/INP) on auto_page_maker pages
B2C funnel (staging): Activation ≥50%, median time-to-activation ≤24h baseline tracking active
B2B funnel (pre-launch): 10–20 verified providers; 100–200 live listings ready
Revenue path and toggles

Revenue start: Phase 3 Go-Live target Dec 16, 2025.
B2C monetization: Credit-pack ARPU tracking enabled; Stripe staged with 0% ramp until stability review Day 3 post-launch.
B2B monetization: 3% provider fee tracking remains frozen until post-Week 2 reliability report; decision at Week 2 CEO review.
CAC: Prioritize SEO flywheel; paid channels remain paused until organic curve validated.
Risk controls and mitigations

Auth instability: Timebox Option A; trigger Option B fallback if needed; add canary clients and synthetic OIDC checks.
Email/SMS deliverability: Enforce SPF/DKIM/DMARC and A2P approvals before any prod ramp; start with Postmark sandbox in staging only.
Data migration: Scholarship_api RDS plan with rollback and load testing before cutover.
Privacy/AI ethics: Retain FERPA/COPPA compliance; matchReasons mandatory; no ghostwriting features; continuous bias checks.
Observability: request_id propagation and Sentry sampling (10%) with PII redaction across all apps.
Answers to open questions and directives

Continue debugging or pause for report (scholar_auth): Continue with Option A now (90-minute timebox). In parallel, draft a one-page technical summary to post at T+30, then finalize at the end of the 90 minutes. If not resolved, immediately execute Option B staging fallback in ≤60 minutes.
Required evidence structure for P0 resolution (scholar_auth):
Fresh boot logs showing adapter-based client lookup path engaged
Successful auth flow for client_id=provider-register with consent page render
JWT example containing roles with correct RBAC claims; JWKS validation proof from a consumer app
Rate-limit metrics on login/token endpoints; /health with dependency checks
Sentry trace chain with request_id across scholar_auth → consumer app
Next checkpoints

T+10: Infra secrets + DNS/A2P evidence posted
T+30: auto_com_center staging validation evidence posted (once secrets live); scholar_auth Option A mid-report posted
T+50: Order chain evidence: provider_register (Order B) → scholarship_api (Order 4) → auto_page_maker (+2 pages within 60s) with full request_id trace
Capital allocation approvals (staging/initial prod)

Approved: Postmark sandbox, Twilio A2P registration, AWS SQS + DLQ, Sentry org-wide, RDS/Atlas budget for auth/api, S3 for document storage. Keep spend lean; prioritize items that directly protect SLOs and SEO.
Required acknowledgments

Each DRI: Reply with “ACK” and exact ETA for your deliverables. All artifacts must include APP_NAME and APP_BASE_URL in headers/metadata.
CEO sign-off

Staging validations: Approved as outlined above.
Production messaging: Locked pending the gate criteria and a CEO war-room review. No exceptions.
Act with urgency, preserve the SEO flywheel, and keep everything evidence-first.
