Acknowledged. Transitioning to Day‑2 Operations and Value Capture.

Day‑2 objectives (next 24–72 hours)

Capture demand: convert “Onboard in <2 minutes” into higher provider signups (+15% CVR target).
Prove stability at scale: pass T+60 GMV cap review; maintain ledger delta = $0.00.
Lock in learning: ship telemetry fix to main with regression tests within 24 hours.
Owner-by-owner orders

Growth/Marketing (GO now)
Landing page: replace hero with “Onboard in < 2 minutes.” Sub‑bullets: Stripe‑verified payouts; Zero reconciliation deltas; FERPA/COPPA compliant.
A/B test: Variant A = “Onboard in < 2 Minutes” (primary), Variant B = “Instant Verification.” • Metric: Provider signup CVR and verified account‑link rate. • Guardrail: P95 latency on /register + /account-link must stay ≤350 ms. • Sample size: run until 300 verified account links or 7 days, whichever first; winner = +5% CVR at 95% confidence.
Outbound: SDR sequence to existing waitlist and top 100 targets (today). CTA: “List scholarships today; payouts ready in minutes.” Include calendar link for 15‑min enablement.
Auto Page Maker: generate provider‑specific SEO pages (“Onboard in <2 minutes” in H1 + schema.org Organization markup). Target 50 pages by EOD+1.
2. Product/Data (GO)

Dashboard: pin “Providers Onboarded/Hour” as top KPI; add per‑endpoint P95, account‑link success, median register→payouts‑enabled.
Attribution: tag B2B signup with source/variant; push to the A8 dashboard hourly.
Experiment analytics: ship event schema for experiment_id, variant, intent score, verified_link, time_to_payouts_enabled.
3. DevOps/SRE (GO)

Telemetry fix: finalize 5s sampling windows and add regression tests; merge within 24 hours.
Synthetic monitors: continuous flows for /register, /onboard, /account-link; alert if P95 > 350 ms for 10 minutes.
Governors: maintain GMV cap $100k (80% pre‑throttle); prepare automated raise request package for T+60.
4. Finance Ops (GO)

Hourly parity check and disputes watch; page on any non‑zero delta.
Daily settlement spot‑check remains mandatory this week; attach logs to A8.
Prepare 24‑hour Business Readout: onboarded/hour vs baseline (+10% target), time‑to‑first‑payout, GMV and 3% fee accrued, reconciliation exceptions (expect 0).
5. Sales/BD (GO)

Rapid enablement kit: 1‑pager “From signup to payouts in 1.6 minutes,” with Stripe‑verified and zero‑delta claims. Distribute to partners and resellers.
6. Compliance (GO)

Include FERPA/COPPA log‑redaction sample and attestations in tomorrow’s readout. Continue daily sampling for 7 days.
Operating cadence and gates

T+60 GMV Governor Review (pre‑scheduled): approve raise to $250k only if last 10 heartbeats green, P95 ≤ 350 ms, error ≤ 0.2%, DLQ=0, compute ≤ 1.4x, ledger delta = $0.00.
24‑hour Business Readout (tomorrow AM): decide whether to keep, scale, or roll back messaging and caps.
Success metrics to report

Providers onboarded/hour (target +10% vs baseline).
Account‑link success ≥ 99.5%; median register→payouts‑enabled ≤ 3 minutes (current ~1.6).
Endpoint P95s: all ≤ 350 ms; Stripe success ≥ 99.5%.
GMV processed; 3% fee accrued; reconciliation exceptions = 0.
Experiment outcome: winning headline with uplift and confidence.
Stop rules (no exceptions)

Any ledger delta > $0.00, DLQ>0, backlog>30, Stripe<99.5%, or auto‑halt triggers → immediate rollback + page CEO.
If P95 drifts >350 ms for 10 minutes on any provider endpoint → callout; pause paid growth pushes until resolved.
This marks the pivot from safety to capitalization. Execute above, and I’ll see you at the T+60 governor review.
