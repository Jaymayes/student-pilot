Acknowledged. Acting as CEO of Scholar AI Advisor, I am issuing final Go/No-Go decisions, cross-app directives, and deadlines aligned to our five-year plan, with HOTL governance and SEO-led, low-CAC growth as first principles per the Playbook V2.0 and our responsibility model for explainable, auditable systems.

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: PARTIAL GO (queues only). Email delivery: DELAYED

What’s approved now: Queue worker on a small Reserved VM (1 vCPU, 1GB). Cost guardrail remains low; this pattern is appropriate for always-on workers vs. stateless autoscale services on Replit .
Blockers: Postmark account access, DKIM CNAMEs, DNS record deployment (SPF, DMARC, DKIM).
Required by: T0+24h for Postmark verification and DNS completion. If not cleared, student_pilot will launch with SSO + in-app notifications only.
Directives: Proceed with Reserved VM deploy immediately; maintain HOTL alarms (AssumeRole failures, DLQ growth, worker down) and an explicit “big red button” rollback per our HOTL governance standard .
Evidence: Provide health endpoint, metrics, and Sentry alerting references in the central evidence root with an index.
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: CONDITIONAL GO (48-hour performance remediation)

SLO gate: P95 ≤120ms; error rate ≤0.1%; no black-box behavior. HOTL checkpoints at T+12/T+24/T+36/T+48 hours with before/after histograms and root-cause explanations to preserve explainability and auditability .
Dependencies: Blocks B2C activation (student_pilot) and B2B OAuth (provider_register). Hitting the SLO protects funnel conversion and ARPU goals laid out in Playbook V2.0 .
Required artifacts: T+30 pre-soak bundle; daily performance reports; code references for PKCE S256, TLS/HSTS, RBAC, and no-PII logging.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY, FROZEN through Nov 12 (affirmed)

Rationale: This is our primary low-CAC acquisition engine; freeze protects the SEO flywheel that feeds the B2C funnel and B2B pipeline per the Playbook’s Year 2 growth model and “first document upload” activation focus .
Operating mode: No code, infra, template, or sitemap changes during freeze. Daily KPI rollup due by 12:00 UTC.
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: CONDITIONAL GO (waitlist mode)

Blockers: Stripe PASS and Deliverability GREEN (auto_com_center). If deliverability is delayed, proceed with SSO + in-app notifications for provider onboarding.
ARR path: This is a primary B2B engine (3% platform fee); aligns to the Playbook’s pivot toward B2B-led growth and enterprise-grade partner tooling .
Governance: Enforce RBAC, PKCE S256 via scholar_auth; publish request_id lineage and fee-calculation determinism to evidence.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED pending gates

Gates: Pre-soak PASS + T+30 bundle (submitted for review), Stripe PASS, and Deliverability GREEN. If deliverability is not cleared by T0+24h, launch with SSO + in-app notifications to protect activation velocity.
Revenue: B2C credits at 4x markup; focus activation on “first document upload” to maximize conversion per the Playbook; maintain organic SEO-led intake from auto_page_maker to keep CAC minimal .
Compliance: COPPA/FERPA posture; no-PII logs; transparent UX for AI assistance.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: CONDITIONAL GO (awaiting CEO evidence review → Full GO upon confirmation)

Target posture: Rules-based, explainable eligibility; audited via request_id lineage. Treat the API as a product: clean contracts, great docs, stable lifecycle, and unified governance plane; this is essential for scale and agent safety .
Performance: Maintain P95 ≤120ms, error ≤0.1%. Provide histograms and Sentry correlation in central evidence root.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (observer/frozen mode)

Required: Daily fairness telemetry rollup at 12:00 UTC. If no artifact produced, raise P1 until evidence exists. This supports our Responsible AI mandate to detect and mitigate bias in operation .
Governance: Observe-only posture; HOTL approvals required for any autonomous action changes .
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (observer/frozen mode)

Required dashboards: Activation (first document upload), conversion to paid credits, ARPU, provider funnel KPIs, aligned to Playbook V2.0 baselines; BI-only posture during freeze .
No changes allowed during freeze.
Enterprise-wide directives and deadlines

Central evidence root: Standardize all artifacts under evidence_root/[app]/ with a CEO_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md per app by 20:00 UTC today. Evidence must include SLO histograms, request_id trace samples, security headers, TLS evidence, and audit-log excerpts to ensure decision traceability and accountability .
Security and compliance: Maintain RBAC and least-privilege, PKCE S256, TLS 1.3 + HSTS, no-PII logs, and end-to-end encryption. Prepare for SOC 2 and continuous audit as part of Year 2 operational objectives .
Deploy patterns: Use Reserved VM for always-on workers like queue consumers; use autoscale for stateless request/response apps to balance cost and reliability on Replit; monitor known platform limits and plan off-platform augmentation if required at scale .
HOTL governance: Maintain approval gates, override mechanisms, and proactive monitoring for all agentic behaviors; all optimization must be explainable and reconstructable via artifacts .
KPIs to report daily at 06:00 UTC

B2C funnel: MAUs from SEO, activation rate (first document upload), free→paid conversion, ARPU from credits; aligns to Playbook growth model .
B2B funnel: Providers onboarded, activation to listings, GMV proxy, 3% platform fee accrual, time-to-first-transaction .
Platform SLOs: Uptime ≥99.9%, P95 latency ≤120ms on auth and core APIs, error rate ≤0.1%.
Deliverability: Time-to-auth-email, bounce/complaint rates post-Postmark go-live.
Next decisions I’m holding as CEO

scholarship_api: Upgrade to FULL GO upon confirmation of the ORDER_4 performance evidence and histograms in the central root.
student_pilot: Upgrade to CONDITIONAL GO if Stripe PASS is confirmed and deliverability is either GREEN or the SSO + in-app fallback is verified in evidence.
provider_register: Upgrade to FULL GO upon Stripe PASS and deliverability/fallback verification; begin B2B ARR tracking immediately thereafter.
Unblocking requests to owners

Postmark/DNS (auto_com_center): Provide Postmark account access and DKIM CNAMEs immediately; deploy SPF and DMARC by T0+6h and complete verification by T0+24h.
Finance (Stripe): Confirm production keys and Stripe PASS today; this directly gates B2C revenue ignition.
All DRIs: Publish CEO_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md to the central evidence root for your app by 20:00 UTC, ensuring traceability, explainability, and audit readiness as required by our governance and ethics framework .
Strategic alignment
This decision package protects our lowest-CAC growth engine (Auto Page Maker freeze), maintains HOTL oversight and explainability for credibility and audit, and prioritizes readiness of auth and core APIs to safeguard activation, conversion, and B2B monetization in line with the updated roadmap and Year 2 objectives in the Playbook V2.0  .
