Fantastic work getting ScholarLink to this level. Here’s a concise, prioritized next-steps plan to move from “production-ready” to “production-proven,” minimize launch risk, and set you up for scale.

Priority 0: Go/No-Go Readiness (this week)

Freeze and triage: Zero P0/P1 bugs, document acceptable known issues.
Go/No-Go checklist: Release notes, rollback plan, change window, owner on-call, success metrics, comms plan.
Rollout strategy: Use blue/green or canary with feature flags; pre-stage rollback artifacts; verify DB schema backward compatibility.
Final UAT: Sign-off from product, security, and ops; run through critical user journeys and billing flows on staging with production-like data.
Security, Compliance, and Privacy

External validation: Commission an independent penetration test and ASV scan; remediate findings before GA.
Secrets and keys: Implement JWT key rotation (kid headers, JWKS endpoint if applicable), rotate API keys, enforce periodic rotation policy.
Data protection:
Redact PII from logs and prompts; verify encryption at rest and in transit; validate ACLs in the document vault.
Define data retention/deletion SLAs and build automated deletion jobs.
Policies and legal: Publish ToS, Privacy Policy, and cookie consent; sign DPAs with vendors; update subprocessor list.
Regulatory: GDPR/CCPA DPIA and ROPA; if serving minors or schools, assess COPPA/FERPA applicability.
SOC 2 roadmap: Lock in core controls (access reviews, change management, logging, incident response); consider Type I within 90 days.
Bug bounty/private disclosure: Set up coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy.
Reliability, Observability, and DR

SLOs/SLIs: Define error budget SLOs (e.g., API availability 99.9%, p95 latency <300 ms, page load p75 <3–5 s). Create burn-rate alerts.
Monitoring:
Dashboards for RED/USE metrics and business KPIs (signups, matches, conversions).
Synthetic checks, uptime monitoring, and a public status page.
Tracing: Adopt OpenTelemetry for traces/logs/metrics using your correlation IDs; trace critical flows end-to-end.
Resilience: Circuit breakers, timeouts, retries, and backoff for OpenAI, Stripe, Agent Bridge; graceful degradation paths.
Backups/DR: Test restore from backup; define RPO/RTO; perform a tabletop DR exercise and at least one live restore test.
Performance and Scale

Load testing: Validate at 2–3x expected peak; confirm autoscaling and DB connection pool behavior; cache hot reads.
Cost controls: FinOps guardrails for GPT-4o and infra; set cost alerts, per-request cost telemetry, and fallbacks/caching for AI calls.
Rate limiting: Calibrate per-user and per-IP limits; add bot defense (CAPTCHA) on signup and payment.
Quality Engineering

Test automation: CI gates for unit/integration/E2E; contract tests for all 32 endpoints; schema versioning with backward compatibility checks.
Performance budgets: API p95 targets; Lighthouse budgets for core web vitals; block deploys that regress.
Chaos and game days: Inject failures (upstream timeouts, DB failover, Stripe outages) to validate runbooks and alerting.
Billing and Monetization

Stripe production readiness:
Live-mode dry runs, idempotency keys, webhook signature verification, replay protection.
Refunds and chargeback runbooks; dunning flows; delinquency handling.
Tax/VAT via Stripe Tax if applicable; invoice/receipt PDFs and exports.
Pricing experiments: Feature flags for price tests; credits usage analytics and alerts; generous trial/beta credits.
AI/ML Governance and Safety

Prompt and model management: Version prompts; maintain evaluation sets; track quality metrics (precision/recall for matches, user ratings for essay feedback).
Safety and integrity: Guardrails for essay assistant (non-plagiarism guidance, attribution prompts); content moderation where appropriate; clear user messaging on AI limits.
Provider strategy: Quotas, retries, and fallback models; per-tenant/provider routing if needed.
Operations, Support, and GTM

On-call and incident response: 24/7 rotation, escalation policy, comms templates; incident severity matrix; postmortem process.
Support readiness: Help center/FAQ, ticketing (e.g., Zendesk), admin tools with ACLs, audit logs for support actions.
Access governance: JIT access for engineers; quarterly access reviews; approvals for privileged actions.
GTM plan:
Private beta (schools/providers) for 2–4 weeks; capture NPS, funnel metrics, and qualitative feedback.
Partnerships with scholarship providers; early adopter success stories.
SEO content for scholarship discovery; analytics instrumentation for funnel events.
API and Developer Experience

Publish developer portal: OpenAPI/Swagger, Postman collection, error codes, rate limits, sample apps/SDKs.
Versioning and deprecation policy: Semantic versioning; changelog; deprecation schedule and notifications.
Documentation and Governance

Runbooks: Stripe incidents, OpenAI rate limits, queue backlogs, Agent Bridge outages, email/SMS failures.
Architecture Decision Records: Capture key design choices and security trade-offs.
License compliance: Inventory OSS licenses; add NOTICE and attribution where required; automate dependency scanning and SBOM.
Suggested 4-week timeline

Week -2: External pen test, load tests, SLOs/alerts finalized, docs/policies published, DPAs signed, DR tabletop.
Week -1: Beta launch (canary), bug fixes, performance tuning, support training, cost guardrails live.
Launch week: Blue/green or canary to 25%/50%/100%, real-time monitoring, daily go/no-go checkpoints, rollback readiness.
Weeks +1 to +4: Post-launch hardening, SOC 2 Type I prep, pricing experiments, partner onboarding, game day.
Key success metrics to track from day 1

Acquisition and activation: Signups, profile completion rate, time-to-first-match, match CTR, application starts/completions.
Monetization: Conversion to paid, ARPU, credits consumed per active user, refund/chargeback rate.
Reliability/performance: Availability, p95 latency per endpoint, error rates, incident MTTR, SLO burn rate.
AI quality: Match precision/recall against curated sets, essay assistant satisfaction, flagged outputs rate.
Cost: AI cost per user/session/match, infra unit costs, cost anomalies.
Top risks and mitigations

Upstream provider instability (OpenAI, Stripe): Circuit breakers, fallbacks, cached responses, precomputed matches.
Cost overruns from AI: Per-user caps, caching, prompt optimization, batch requests, cost alerts.
Data exposure: Strict ACL enforcement, PII redaction in logs/prompts, regular access reviews.
Abuse/spam: Email/SMS verification, CAPTCHA, rate limits, fraud signals on payments.
Model reliability: Human-in-the-loop review for critical flows early on; clear user guidance.
