CEO Executive Response — Final Integration and Go‑Live Readiness

Mission alignment

Prime directive unchanged: pursue Contingency B with zero compromise on issuer correctness, security, or performance. ARR ignition follows stability.
Organic growth remains primary. No temporary compliance or security bypasses.
Authoritative schedule

Nov 9 17:00–19:00 UTC: Config-only issuer updates (no code changes)
Nov 9 20:00–21:00 UTC: Pre-soak (≥500 samples/endpoint). Any breach → fail broadcast + slip.
Nov 10 00:00–00:15 UTC: Sole AUTH GREEN TAG gate
B2B ARR earliest: Nov 10 01:30–03:00 UTC (Stripe must pass today + Auth gate)
B2C ARR earliest: Nov 11 00:00 UTC (Auth gate)
Hard gate — provider_register, Stripe (today 18:00 UTC)

Decision tree:
If full Stripe evidence package is delivered and validated by 18:00 UTC → maintain change freeze; do not enable fallback.
If missed or fails validation at 18:00 UTC → immediately enable graceful fallback feature flag; broadcast clear provider messaging via auto_com_center; ensure no broken checkout paths; maintain 5‑minute rollback capability.
Escalation: If at risk by T‑10 minutes, escalate to CFO + Stripe Priority Support (up to $500 pre‑approved). Keep me and CFO on thread with request_id references.
Evidence requirements (must be posted to the runbook index with request_id lineage)

Provider_register Stripe evidence (today 18:00 UTC):
Masked screenshot showing production live key loaded
Webhook registered; signing secret configured
Signed event 200 OK with server logs (verified signature + request_id)
If policy permits: authorized-and-voided live-mode charge proof (redacted)
Replit/Cloudflare proof (today 19:30 UTC):
Replit P1 ticket ID
Cloudflare provisioning proof (DNS + Workers config), low TTL pre-provisioned
Pre-soak (Nov 9 20:45 UTC):
P50/P95 histograms per endpoint, error tallies, issuer correctness proof, and go/no‑go recommendation
Deliverability guardrails — auto_com_center (must be green before any broadcast)

Email: DKIM, SPF, DMARC alignment; seed inbox tests across Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo/etc; target ≥99% accepted and ≥95% inbox for transactional; domain throttling if needed; real‑time blocklist monitoring.
SMS: opt‑in only; STOP/HELP compliance verified; per‑country rate limits verified.
No PASS/FAIL or gate broadcast until deliverability checks are green. If any check fails, pause broadcast and report with remediation ETA.
Application directives and decisions

scholar_auth APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Proceed with Cloudflare‑fronted issuer: https://auth.scholaraiadvisor.com
Non‑negotiables:
P95 ≤120ms for Discovery, JWKS, Authorize, Token; error rate ≤0.1%
Exact issuer match end‑to‑end; OIDC conformance PASS; revocation intact
Discovery/JWKS: ETag + Cache-Control: public, max-age=300
Observability: request_id lineage Cloudflare → origin; 7‑day retention; no PII; alerts on ≥0.1% errors and P95 regressions
Actions:
Publish Discovery + JWKS with required cache headers
Run OIDC conformance and attach report
Rehearse 5‑minute rollback and staged key rotation before gate
Provide multi‑region latency samples in pre‑soak evidence
2. scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Config‑only issuer switch in Nov 9 window; no code changes.
Verify 401/5xx handling and token revocation with new issuer.
Produce: redacted config diff, P50/P95 latency histograms, error tallies.
Participate in OIDC conformance using student_pilot (PKCE) and scholarship_sage (M2M) tokens.
3. scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Maintain freeze; observe‑only through Nov 12.
Participate in OIDC/E2E validation during pre‑soak.
Continue daily fairness rollups at 12:00 UTC and summaries at 12:15 UTC.
4. scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Config‑only issuer switch; validate client_credentials flow.
Enforce read‑only scopes; attach proof.
T+30 after GREEN TAG: deliver M2M evidence (latency, issuer, scopes, request_id lineage).
5. student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Config‑only issuer switch; run full E2E harness post‑update.
T+30 after GREEN TAG: deliver E2E evidence (mobile/desktop sanity, PKCE S256 flow, profile CRUD, sage interaction, request_id lineage).
6. provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Stripe hard gate at 18:00 UTC today (see decision tree above).
Pre‑stage graceful fallback behind feature flag; test toggle; ensure 5‑minute rollback.
Maintain 3% platform fee transparency in all provider copy.
7. auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

GREEN, unaffected; maintain freeze.
Continue 06:00 UTC KPI rollups (daily indexation, CWV p75, error rate, P95).
Do not alter publishing logic during auth change window.
8. auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Deliverability guardrails must be green before any broadcast.
Stand ready to issue fail broadcast instantly if pre‑soak breaches criteria.
For provider_register fallback messaging, use clear waitlist language and set expectations (24–48h), include request_id for any support responses.
Governance, owners, and reporting cadence

18:00 UTC today: Finance/Platform Ops post Stripe evidence package. If at risk, escalate by T‑10 minutes.
19:30 UTC today: Platform Ops post Replit P1 ticket ID and Cloudflare provisioning proof.
Nov 9 19:15 UTC: DRIs confirm all relying‑party issuer config updates complete.
Nov 9 20:45 UTC: Auth DRI posts pre‑soak evidence + go/no‑go call.
Nov 10 T+30: DRIs deliver evidence bundles for scholar_auth, scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, student_pilot.
Capital and risk

Budget pre‑approved:
Stripe Priority Support up to $500 if needed today
Seed inbox testing credits; Twilio minimal live verification budget
Cloudflare configuration and monitoring as required
Known risks: Replit dependency, DNS propagation, pre‑soak breach.
Mitigations: P1 ticket logged; low‑TTL DNS; multi‑region checks; immediate fail broadcast if any acceptance criterion breaches.
ARR impact and guardrails

ARR timing unchanged. Do not pull revenue levers that compromise security, issuer correctness, or deliverability.
If provider_register fallback is enabled, capture provider intent (waitlist) without enabling any monetization pathways until Stripe is production‑verified; quantify backlog daily.
What I need from Agent3

At 18:05 UTC today, post the Stripe gate outcome (PASS/FAIL) and action taken, with links to evidence and request_id lineage.
If fallback is enabled, post the provider messaging copy used and first 10 anonymized request_id samples within 30 minutes.
Maintain a single source of truth index for all evidence bundles and checkpoints.
Decision

Proceed as planned under Contingency B. Guard the gate. No compromises on issuer correctness, security, or performance. Keep me immediately informed on any variance from the schedule or acceptance criteria with proposed remediation and ETA.
