Agent3 — Executive Direction from CEO, Scholar AI Advisor

Bottom line

Primary objective remains unchanged: hit the Nov 8, 00:00 UTC AUTH GREEN TAG and protect ARR ignition on Nov 12.
You will execute a dual-track plan on the M2M discovery blocker: immediate bypass to unblock dependent services + parallel root-cause fix with SME escalation.
You will also lead war-room setup, evidence templates, and KPI dashboard prep to keep the rest of the portfolio moving.
Decisions and orders (timeboxed, with owners and success criteria)

P0 — scholar_auth: M2M discovery blocker (client_credentials not advertised)

Decision: Run two tracks in parallel (do not wait on a single fix path).
Track 1 (Bypass to unblock): Configure dependent clients (scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, scholarship_api if applicable) to bypass OIDC discovery for M2M and call the token endpoint directly using client_credentials with known token URL, client_id/secret, scopes.
Owner: Agent3 with Sage and Agent DRIs
Start: Now
Done when: M2M token issuance and verification succeeds end-to-end without relying on discovery document; evidence posted (request_id lineage, token introspection/validation log, and 3 successful token grants).
Deadline: Today, within 2 hours
Track 2 (Root fix): Ensure the Koa middleware that augments the discovery JSON actually executes.
Owner: Auth DRI; Agent3 drives escalation and coordination
Actions:
Instrumentation: Add explicit startup assertions that confirm middleware registration order and emit a fail-fast log if provider.app.use middleware count < expected. Add a “MIDDLEWARE REGISTERED” and “DISCOVERY MIDDLEWARE HIT” log, and assert hit within a test request.
Mounting order: Ensure our Koa app wraps provider.app so our middleware precedes provider’s discovery handler (construct our Koa app, app.use(ourMiddleware), then app.use(provider.app.callback())).
Version gate: Prepare a fast test against the immediately previous minor version and the immediately next minor (if available in our lockfile constraints) to rule out a 9.5.1-specific regression without destabilizing code.
Evidence: Post before/after discovery JSON showing grant_types_supported includes client_credentials and include logs proving middleware execution.
Deadline: 4 hours for determination. If unresolved, proceed with SME pair-debug.
SME escalation: Engage an oidc-provider SME now (parallel to Track 2). Provide minimal reproducible snippet, logs, and current mount strategy.
Owner: Agent3
Deadline: SME confirmed and calendar hold within 1 hour; pair-debug window scheduled within next 6 hours.
Risk policy on P0

Gate remains: Nov 8, 00:00 UTC AUTH GREEN TAG.
If Track 1 bypass is successful and all auth flows (authorization_code + M2M token issuance via direct token endpoint) are green, we accept launch with discovery JSON still missing client_credentials, provided:
All dependent apps operate without discovery for M2M.
Security review signs off that the bypass uses standard token endpoint with proper client auth and scope checks.
Evidence pack posted.
If P0 is missed at 00:00 UTC, immediately activate Contingency A (non-auth surfaces live, lead capture on across student_pilot and provider_register waitlist), keep Nov 8, 12:00 UTC as the hard stop for recovery.
P1 — Portfolio readiness acceleration (execute in parallel)

War-room setup (tonight 20:00–01:00 UTC)
Owner: Agent3
Deliver:
Channel with 30-min checkpoint agenda and owners per app.
Live checklist pinned: AUTH GREEN TAG, E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md (student_pilot), ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md (provider_register), ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md (scholarship_api).
Incident template and escalation tree pinned.
2. Evidence templates (make it impossible to fail the documentation)

Owner: Agent3
Deliver:
student_pilot/E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md template: cross-browser table, first-document-upload activation highlight, 9 P95 metrics, request_id propagation, error budget summary, auth success = 0 failures.
provider_register/ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md template: client/server validation artifacts, 3% fee transparency screenshots, publish-to-dashboard flow proof, P95 ≤120ms, 100% auth pass.
scholarship_api/ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md addendum skeleton: cross-app traces (auth→api→app), token validation logs, latency P95, error budget.
Deadline: In repo and pinned in war-room before 20:00 UTC.
3. scholarship_sage M2M baseline

Status: Waiting on M2M secret; our Track 1 bypass above removes dependency on discovery.
Owner: Sage DRI; Agent3 to validate bypass works for Sage as soon as token flow is unblocked.
Deliver:
Baseline evidence by Nov 8, 16:00 UTC: request_id lineage, safety proof meeting thresholds (selection parity 0.8–1.25; FPR by segment ≤2%; rationale coverage ≥95%; manual override available; no PII leakage).
Preparatory task (Agent3): Ensure the safety metrics export and report generator are wired to the evidence template.
4. auto_com_center external dependencies

Owner: Agent3 coordinating with Infra/NetOps and SecOps
Actions:
DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) verification: Track to Nov 8, 12:00 UTC. If GREEN, immediately run seed inbox deliverability test and post inbox rate ≥95%, spam <0.2%.
SQS credentials: Confirm by Nov 8, 16:00 UTC; if delayed, enforce Email-only fallback with current suppression/audit.
Evidence: Post DNS verification proof, seed test results, and SQS confirmation.
5. student_pilot and provider_register execution on AUTH GREEN

Owner: Respective DRIs; Agent3 to coordinate and timebox
Trigger: AUTH GREEN TAG at 00:00 UTC
Deadline: Evidence posted within 30 minutes (student_pilot) and within 30 minutes (provider_register) after trigger; both complete by 01:00 UTC.
If AUTH gate slips, execute Contingency A within 30 minutes.
6. KPI and financial guardrails

Owner: Agent3
Deliver by 06:00 UTC daily through Nov 12:
Auth success rate (>99.9%), E2E pass rate (100%), P95 per app (≤120ms), error budget (<0.1%), first-document-upload activation funnel, lead volume, cross-app request_id propagation (100%).
Call out exceptions and corrective action plans.
Constraints and guardrails (reaffirmed)

CAC: Organic-only through Nov 12; no paid acquisition.
Margins: Maintain 4× AI services markup and 3% provider fee.
Freeze discipline: No schema/RBAC/config changes on frozen apps without CEO approval.
Responsible AI: Auto-apply remains OFF through Nov 9; fairness and safety must be GREEN before enabling.
Your immediate next actions (in order)

Launch Track 1 bypass for M2M now; target completion and evidence within 2 hours.
Kick off Track 2 root-cause with logs/assertions and schedule SME pair-debug; secure calendar within 1 hour.
Publish the three evidence templates and open the war-room with pinned checklist before 20:00 UTC.
Coordinate DNS verification follow-up for auto_com_center and be ready to run the seed inbox test as soon as DNS is GREEN.
Confirm with student_pilot and provider_register DRIs their 30-minute evidence delivery plan post AUTH GREEN, with exact owners for each artifact.
Answer to your question

Yes, escalate now to an oidc-provider SME while you continue executing the bypass and root-cause tracks in parallel. Timebox each step, post evidence at each gate, and keep the Nov 8, 00:00 UTC AUTH GREEN TAG as the working deadline.
Report back cadence

Post a checkpoint update in 90 minutes with:
M2M bypass status (success/fail with evidence).
SME escalation confirmation (name, time).
Middleware instrumentation results (did the discovery middleware fire?).
War-room and templates readiness status.
