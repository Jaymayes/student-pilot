CEO Executive Roll-Up — Final Integration and Go-Live Readiness (Decision Memo)
Date: 2025-11-06
Time: 23:15 UTC
Prime Objective: Protect Nov 12 ARR ignition; enable safe Nov 9 (1% ramp) under evidence-first discipline.

Executive Summary

Overall decision: Conditional GO, tightly scoped.
Logged-in flows: NO-GO until hard AUTH_GREEN evidence is produced. This is the gating item for student_pilot and provider_register E2E.
Non-auth flows: GO. auto_page_maker compounding continues; scholarship_agent observe-only telemetry remains ON; auto_com_center in-app notifications only until DNS/SQS are GREEN.
Mission protection: If AUTH is not green with artifacts by Nov 7 12:00 UTC, we slip the Nov 9 1% ramp by 24–48 hours. Nov 12 ARR remains achievable if AUTH is fixed within 12–18 hours and student_pilot E2E completes immediately after.
scholar_auth APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: YELLOW (claims of GREEN conflict with live evidence from student_pilot invalid_client)

What’s green:
OIDC discovery reportedly live
Track B plan documented; Track A backfill plan documented
Sage M2M secret reportedly issued; provider acceptance criteria defined
Blocker (critical):
invalid_client returned for student_pilot login; indicates client registration/redirect_uri mismatch or missing client in static registry
CEO Orders (evidence-first, immediate):
Within 60 minutes: Post AUTH_GREEN evidence pack containing:
CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT with SHA-256 + timestamp
/.well-known/openid-configuration 200 OK capture
/authorize → actual consent screen screenshot for student-pilot client_id
/token code→token (redacted) proving PKCE S256 path
The exact redirect_uri values now allowed for student_pilot and provider_register (include test and prod)
Screenshot/log of successful refresh_token where applicable (Track B limits noted if refresh is Track A)
Align client_id, redirect_uri, scopes with student_pilot and provider_register DRIs; publish a single source-of-truth client config file
Produce a 10-minute smoke test video/GIF showing authorize→consent→token→app redirect for student_pilot
Estimated Go-Live (AUTH_GREEN with artifacts): Nov 6, 24:15–24:45 UTC if executed now; hard backstop Nov 7, 12:00 UTC
ARR Ignition Contribution Start: Immediately after student_pilot E2E passes (same day)
Security/SLO guardrails:
Maintain OAuth2/OIDC best practices, revocation endpoint working, secure storage, rotating secrets; P95 ≤120ms; 99.9% uptime
2. scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GREEN

Endpoints: CRUD for scholarships, profiles, providers, applications; docs in place
Performance: P95 ~73.6ms; error 0%; uptime 100%
Security: Token validation enforced; RBAC on writes (403 when unauthorized)
Data: PostgreSQL ACID validated
Orders: Hold state; join cross-app traces upon student_pilot E2E completion
Estimated Go-Live: Live
ARR Ignition: Supports both funnels immediately when student_pilot unblocks
Third-party: PostgreSQL (operational, GREEN)
3. scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GREEN (observe-only)

Core: Matching logic accurate; fairness telemetry and explainability on; auto-apply disabled
Performance: P95 ~42ms; error 0%; uptime 100%
Integrations: Auth path asserted but waits on student_pilot cross-app traces
Orders:
Remain observe-only for Nov 9 1% ramp
Provide cross-app request_id traces right after student_pilot E2E passes
Estimated Go-Live: Live (observe-only)
ARR Ignition: Contributes immediately post student_pilot unblocking
4. scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GREEN

Advisory quality: Ready; safety and relevance guardrails in place
Performance: P95 ~1ms; error 0%; uptime 100%
Integration: Needs M2M secret; report says secret issued; begin 48h baseline
Orders:
Start 48h baseline immediately; deliver baseline_metrics_evidence.md by Nov 8 ~16:00 UTC
Estimated Go-Live: Live (advisory baseline underway)
ARR Ignition: Supports ARPU lift post-baseline; not blocking ramp
5. student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: RED (auth gate)

Evidence: invalid_client on redirect to scholar_auth
Impact: 95-step E2E blocked; cannot deliver cross-app traces; logged-in user journey blocked
CEO Orders:
Await AUTH evidence; once posted, execute 95-step E2E within 30 minutes
Post E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md: screenshots, metrics, traces, P95 ≤120ms, error <0.1%
Estimated Go-Live: T+30 min after AUTH_GREEN artifacts
ARR Ignition: At risk until unblocked; requires immediate resolution (see CEO Risk Gate below)
Responsiveness/compatibility: Non-auth pages OK; final validation after E2E
6. provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: YELLOW (ready but auth acceptance pending)

What’s ready: Healthy runtime (P95 ~2ms); OIDC wiring complete on app side; validation/logging good
Blocker: OAuth client not registered or redirect URIs not whitelisted in scholar_auth
Orders:
Execute acceptance criteria after AUTH DRI registers client and whitelists redirect URIs
Deliver ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md confirming 200 OK discovery, consent screen, error-rate <0.1%, P95 ≤120ms, and no invalid_client
Estimated Go-Live: Nov 7, 16:00 UTC (on-time if AUTH fixed now)
ARR Ignition: Enables B2B revenue (3% fee) post-acceptance

Metrics: 2,101 pages live; IndexNow ≥95%; CWV p75 GREEN; P95 ~100ms; errors 0%; uptime 100%
Auth dependency: None
Orders: Continue compounding; execute ORDER_4; maintain IndexNow ≥95% and CWV GREEN; post evidence per SLA
Estimated Go-Live: Live
ARR Ignition: Drives low-CAC top-of-funnel now
8. auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: INTERNAL GREEN; EXTERNAL RED

Internal: In-app notifications ready; Unsubscribe P95 18.8ms; Latency P95 87ms; Error 0%

CEO Risk Gate and Timeline

Gate 1 (Critical): AUTH_GREEN with artifacts for student_pilot and provider_register
Deadline: Nov 6, 24:45 UTC (aggressive); absolute backstop Nov 7, 12:00 UTC
If missed: Slip Nov 9 1% ramp by 24–48 hours; protect Nov 12 ARR via compressed E2E and staged ramp starting Nov 10–11
Gate 2: Provider auth acceptance
Deadline: Nov 7, 16:00 UTC (on schedule contingent on Gate 1)
Gate 3: External Comms (Email) DNS
First verification: Nov 8, 12:00 UTC; activate email channel on pass
Gate 4: AWS SQS credentials rotation
Deadline: Nov 8, 16:00 UTC; restore DLQ/real-time alerting
Gate 5: AUTH Track A backfill (refresh tokens, revocation, issuer/basepath parity)
Deadline: Nov 11, 18:00 UTC
Immediate, Time-Boxed Orders (next 120 minutes)

Monetization and KPI Guardrails

B2C: Conversion dependent on student_pilot; do not scale spend; rely on auto_page_maker SEO compounding. Target: preserve ARPU via Sage uplift post-baseline.
B2B: Provider acceptance unlocks 3% fee; prioritize auth acceptance by Nov 7.
CAC: Maintain low-CAC model; no incremental paid channels until post-Nov 12 stability report.
SLOs: Hold 99.9% uptime and ≤120ms P95 across apps; continue request_id propagation for traceability.
Responsible AI and Compliance

Keep scholarship_agent observe-only through the ramp; no auto-apply until fairness telemetry reviewed post-ramp.
Maintain explainability (“Why this match?”) and bias monitoring in both agent and sage.
Ensure FERPA/COPPA alignment; no PII in logs; unsubscribe and spam compliance verified before enabling external email.
CEO Decision

Nov 9 1% ramp: Conditional GO, scope-limited to non-auth surfaces and observe-only agent; in-app notifications only. Full GO for logged-in journeys is contingent on AUTH evidence and passing student_pilot E2E.
Nov 12 ARR ignition: On track if AUTH gate is cleared within the next 12–18 hours and provider acceptance completes by Nov 7, 16:00 UTC.
Escalation Protocol

War-room opens now; hourly check-ins until AUTH evidence posted.
If AUTH evidence is not posted by Nov 7, 12:00 UTC, I will re-baseline the ramp schedule and publish a revised ARR plan within 2 hours.
Accountability Snapshot (Owners and Deadlines)

Auth DRI: AUTH_GREEN evidence pack — due T+60 min; Track A backfill by Nov 11, 18:00 UTC
student_pilot DRI: 95-step E2E evidence — due T+90 min (post-AUTH)
provider_register DRI: Acceptance evidence — due Nov 7, 16:00 UTC
Comms DRI: In-app live now; email on DNS GREEN Nov 8, 12:00 UTC; SQS restored Nov 8, 16:00 UTC (with Infra/SecOps)
