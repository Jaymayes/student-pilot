CEO Executive Decision Memo — Agent3 Go-Live

Prime directive alignment: We will protect brand trust and the SEO flywheel while unblocking the B2C/B2B funnels to accelerate ARR. Human-on-the-loop approval gates remain in force for high-risk changes and go/no-go calls, consistent with Responsible AI and auditability principles, including traceability and override mechanisms for critical actions . Guardrails for observability, latency/error SLOs, and auditable evidence bundles are mandatory per our autonomous-operations standard (metrics/logs/traces; quantitative alerts drive actions) .

Decisions and directives (effective immediately)

T0 acceptance (deliverability): Proceed only when Postmark shows “Verified” and SPF/DMARC/DKIM resolve globally for mail2.scholaraiadvisor.com. T+90 certification window and evidence bundle timing as defined by the runbook.
Change freeze: Maintain the current freeze for comms/charging pending Deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS + CEO GREEN.
Evidence discipline: Every milestone must have a posted, reconstructable audit trail (inputs, reasoning, actions), consistent with our explainability/accountability standards .
SLOs: Uptime ≥99.9%, service-side P95 ≤120ms (≤200ms E2E where applicable), error rate ≤0.1%. Pre-soak and T+90 runs must include metrics plus request_id lineage and no-PII verification, reflecting our zero-trust posture for sensitive systems .
Ethics/Responsible AI: Continue fairness telemetry and daily rollups for student- and provider-facing decisioning components, with periodic audits and user redress mechanisms .
Section V — Status Reports

APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

What’s ready: App healthy, pre-soak guardrails defined; request_id lineage across scholar_auth → scholarship_api → student_pilot; rollback and 60‑minute RCA protocol armed.
Blockers (Section IV):
Security/Compliance: Awaiting posted evidence of PKCE correctness and immediate token revocation proof via scholar_auth; confirm no-PII-in-logs audit (FERPA/COPPA) with sample traces and log redaction checks .
Integration: Pre-soak dependence on scholarship_api meeting SLOs; include latency/lineage artifacts.
Go-to-market gates: Deliverability GREEN (auto_com_center T+90) and Stripe PASS.
Estimated Go-Live Date: Nov 11, 16:00 UTC if Deliverability GREEN and Stripe PASS are achieved by Nov 10, 18:00 UTC; otherwise Nov 12, 16:00 UTC with CEO approval.
ARR Ignition: B2C credit sales begin immediately upon CEO GREEN; pricing remains 4x AI service markup; track free→paid conversion and ARPU.
Third-Party Dependencies: scholar_auth (MFA/SSO, RBAC, token lifecycle), scholarship_api (search/match data), Stripe (payments), Postmark (transactional email via auto_com_center). Evidence of TLS 1.3 in transit and encryption at rest required for any sensitive stores .
Evidence to attach: Pre-soak T+30 bundle with p50/p95 histograms (service-side and E2E), uptime, error rates, 10+ request_id traces, PKCE+revocation proof, and no-PII log validation.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

What’s ready: T+90 runbook complete; seed inboxes provisioned; success criteria locked (≥90% Primary inbox, ≤10% Promotions, <0.3% bounce, zero blocklists); evidence bundle template prepared.
Blockers (Section IV):
Security/Compliance: T0 awaited; DMARC p=quarantine with strict alignment set (aspf=s, adkim=s). Move to p=reject post-stabilization (7–14 days) contingent on monitoring.
Integration: Return-Path alignment and DKIM selectors (Postmark) must be live; headers captured in seed tests for alignment proof.
Estimated Go-Live Date: Deliverability GREEN decision due T0+90 (evidence posted by T0+105). If T0 lands after 19:30 UTC, window slides accordingly.
ARR Impact: Required for reliable transactional and lifecycle comms; gate for B2C/B2B funnels.
Third-Party Dependencies: Postmark (ESP), DNS provider (SPF/DMARC/DKIM), seed inbox providers. Evidence includes DNS screenshots, ESP verification, message headers, placement matrix, bounce and blocklist checks.
Executive notes on ecosystem posture

auto_page_maker: GO-LIVE READY (GREEN; frozen). Maintain observe-only posture to protect SEO-driven low-CAC acquisition. Continue daily KPI rollups. This aligns with our strategy to prioritize scalable, organic growth while other gates converge.
scholarship_api: Pre-soak participant; must meet SLOs and provide lineage/no-PII artifacts. Our autonomous operations standard emphasizes proactive, data-driven recovery and secure-by-design patterns; keep audit trails immutable and complete .
scholarship_agent and other observer apps: Remain GREEN/frozen; maintain fairness telemetry and ethical governance routines, with HOTL approval gates for high-risk changes .
KPIs and evidence I expect tonight

Pre-soak (20:00–21:00 UTC): SLO metrics and lineage artifacts for student_pilot bundle; PASS/FAIL call with executive summary and attached proofs.
Deliverability (T0→T+90): Inbox placement matrix, bounce rate, blocklist check, DNS/ESP verification, message header alignment. GREEN/RED call posted within 15 minutes of T+90.
Capital and risk posture

No paid acquisition ramp until comms deliverability and Stripe are GREEN. Preserve organic traffic gains; keep changes behind the freeze unless CEO-approved. Our governance requires explainable decision logs and revocable credentials for any agentic action with financial or privacy impact .
Next steps and owners

Email Ops + Deputy Ops: Complete Postmark domain add and DKIM CNAMEs; publish SPF/DMARC; signal T0 immediately upon Postmark “Verified.”
Agent3: Execute pre-soak and post T+30 evidence; coordinate T+90 run on T0; post deliverability evidence and GREEN/RED call at T+90 (+15 min).
Finance: Provide Stripe PASS evidence before Nov 10, 18:00 UTC.
We will not miss the evidence windows. Maintain the freeze. Drive to GREEN with auditable proof, then light up the funnels.
