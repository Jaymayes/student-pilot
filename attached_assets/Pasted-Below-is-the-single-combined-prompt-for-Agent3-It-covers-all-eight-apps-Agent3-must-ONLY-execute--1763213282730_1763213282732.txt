Below is the single, combined prompt for Agent3. It covers all eight apps. Agent3 must ONLY execute the section that matches the app they are currently inside. Do not touch any other sections. If the app cannot be 100% production-ready today, provide a precise ETA to GO LIVE, confirm ARR ignition date, and list the third-party systems that must be in place.

MASTER ORCHESTRATION PROMPT — Agent3
Date: 2025-11-15
Prime Objective: Get your assigned app 100% production-ready and working with the rest of the platform today. If “today” is not achievable, provide an exact ETA to GO LIVE, ARR ignition date, and required third-party systems.

Global Operating Rules (apply to every app)

Only act on the section that corresponds to your app. Ignore all other sections.
At the top of every report and file you produce, include: APP NAME: <exact app name> APP_BASE_URL: <exact base URL from the list below>
Enforce security and reliability:
RS256 JWT verification using scholar_auth JWKS, validate iss and aud, accept both scope and permissions[] as first-class authorization sources. Deny if neither is present.
CORS: S2S-only for back-end/internal services; exact-origin allowlist for browser apps. No wildcard.
Health endpoints: /healthz and /readyz must return HTTP 200 with meaningful JSON.
CorrelationId (x-request-id) propagation end-to-end.
P95 latency target ≈120ms. Record results.
Zero hardcoded URLs and secrets. All config via environment variables.
Evidence deliverables for CEO:
Executive Status Report file saved in repo with no spaces: EXEC_STATUS_<APP>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
Must include: Overall status, GO/NO-GO, what changed today, must-have checklist with pass/fail, cURL smoke tests with expected vs actual, required env vars, third-party prerequisites, step-by-step go-live plan with time estimates, ARR impact and ARR ignition date, open blockers with owner and ETA.
Include your app name and base URL at the top of every report and log you output or save.

CORS: S2S-only for token endpoint (deny browser origins except PKCE exchange)
Provision M2M clients for all apps with least-privilege scopes:
scholarship_api, scholarship_agent, scholarship_sage, provider_register, auto_page_maker, auto_com_center

Final Instructions to Agent3

Determine which app you are inside by repository name and base URL. Do nothing outside your section.
Execute all deliverables for your section today. If any dependency blocks you, deliver:
Conditional GO plan with exact ETA (date and time UTC) to flip to full GO.
ARR ignition date when your app’s contribution can start producing revenue.
The list of third-party systems and exact configuration steps still required (DNS, API keys, secrets).
Produce and save the Executive Status Report using the exact template and filename:
EXEC_STATUS_<APP>_20251115.md
Include APP NAME and APP_BASE_URL at the top.
Post your Go/No-Go result and the evidence (smoke test outputs, key cURL results, and configuration screenshots if applicable).
If GO today is achieved, initiate integration tests with your immediate upstream/downstream apps and record correlation IDs and P95 latencies across calls.
Reminder: Student value is business value. Aim for a frictionless, secure, and fast integration that supports ARR by December 1, 2025 at the latest.
