CEO Decision Memo — Scholar AI Advisor
Time: 23:45 UTC | Prime directive alignment: Maintain path to Dec 16 go-live and ARR ignition; protect SEO flywheel; uphold SLOs and Responsible AI guardrails

Executive acknowledgment

The Gate A directive and ecosystem updates are received and reviewed. The Option B (staging IdP fallback) decision stands. Our mission remains disciplined execution toward a profitable $10M+ ARR trajectory with B2B as the growth engine while preserving low-CAC organic acquisition via Auto Page Maker SEO at launch and beyond, consistent with the revised Playbook V2.0 and KPI model .
Decisions and gates

Authentication path
Staging: GO now on Option B (Keycloak/Auth0). Production remains LOCKED pending all gates below.
Reversion: Cut back to primary scholar_auth only after P0 PASS and 24h soak with 0 invalid_client and evidence posted.
2. Infrastructure secrets — hard deadline and escalation

Infra DRI must deliver the following to all apps within T+10 (from timestamp above). Miss = auto-escalation to CEO war-room and human-in-loop:
SENTRY_DSN (per-app)
AWS SQS + DLQ (IAM policy + credentials)
Postmark (ESP) and Twilio (SMS) secrets in secrets manager
DNS/A2P: SPF/DKIM/DMARC validated + A2P brand/campaign approvals
Rationale: Centralized observability, async queue durability, and communications readiness are non-negotiable for a safe, phased launch and organic growth engine continuity, in line with our event-driven and observability-first architecture .
3. Production gate criteria — unchanged and enforced

Observability: request_id propagation across all 8 apps, Sentry 10% sampling on by default (PII redaction verified), e2e trace chain evidence posted.
SLOs: P95 ≤120ms read paths (≤150ms write paths), error rate <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9%.
Security and compliance: FERPA/COPPA controls active; SOC 2 acceleration plan remains Year 2 per Playbook; “Trust & Security” packet ready for B2B motions .
Communications readiness: unsubscribe SLA <5s; validated ESP/SMS; DLQ=0; templates verified; no real recipients in staging.
Chain evidence: Order B (provider_register), Order 4 (scholarship_api), +2 pages (auto_page_maker) with sitemap diff, IndexNow receipts, CWV p75 GREEN, and trace correlation.
Strategic clarifications and mandates

Service catalog attestation (scope correction): Conflicting reports on “only 3 apps exist” vs the defined 8-app ecosystem create integration risk. Within 24 hours, scholarship_agent will collect and publish the authoritative Service Catalog Attestation listing APP_NAME, APP_BASE_URL, /health URL, role, and dependency map for each app (8 of 8). No further integration work proceeds without this artifact. This addresses API inventory risk noted in autonomous system governance and OWASP API inventory controls .
Third-party foundations (budget/selection affirmed):
DB: Production-grade managed database for scholar_auth and scholarship_api (Amazon RDS) — approved.
Queue: AWS SQS + DLQ — approved. Event-first backbone is essential to decouple services and control Replit autoscale costs via asynchronous processing .
Object storage: AWS S3 — approved (document uploads; privacy by design).
ESP/SMS: Postmark/Twilio — approved.
Error monitoring: Sentry — approved.
Payments: Stripe — approved if/when premium credits and provider fee enforcement move from toggle to ON.
Phased rollout discipline: Continue staged, monitored ramps with evidence at each step and “observe-only” posture where applicable, per responsible autonomy and phased release best practices .
Application directives (executive scope only; operations remain with DRIs)

scholar_auth (https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Proceed with Option B staging IdP fallback immediately; primary remains locked until P0 PASS + 24h soak; RBAC parity (Student/Provider/Admin) required; publish parity evidence. Governance hardening aligns with our identity posture and phased activation guidance .
scholarship_api (https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Order 4 execution within 20 minutes of Order B evidence; event emission (scholarship_created) must trigger auto_page_maker; RDS migration plan due Nov 7, 22:00 UTC (unchanged).
scholarship_agent (https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Monitoring-only role confirmed; enforce T+10/T+30/T+50 checkpoint posts; hold escalation authority on secrets miss; publish Service Catalog Attestation within 24 hours.
scholarship_sage (https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Start 48-hour observe-only baseline immediately upon M2M secret receipt; deliver precision@5, coverage, matchReasons samples, and request_id traces at +48h. Maintain anonymization and fairness checks consistent with Responsible AI governance .
student_pilot (https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Stay GREEN on SLOs and WCAG 2.1 AA remediation; publish weekly cohort reports on activation and application conversion; integrate recommendations display once scholarship_sage exits observe-only and is cleared.
provider_register (https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Execute Order B within 20 minutes of staging issuer live; include JWT roles=["Provider"] parity evidence; confirm CRUD roundtrip with scholarship_api.
auto_page_maker (https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
On Order 4 trigger, generate +2 pages in <60s; deliver evidence in <10 minutes with sitemap diff, IndexNow receipts, CWV p75 GREEN, and P95 ≤120ms. Any CWV regression >5% triggers automatic rollback; SEO is our lowest-CAC lever and must remain GREEN at p75 to support our five-year growth economics .
auto_com_center (https://auto-com-center.scholaraiadvisor.com)
Execute staging validation immediately upon secrets; hold production LOCK until DNS/A2P + evidence complete. Unsubscribe SLA <5s and DLQ=0 are release gates.
Testing and evidence-first culture

Adhere to layered testing (unit → integration → system → UAT) with system-level E2E runs for Student (Registration → Recommendation → Application) and Provider (Registration → Listing) journeys before go-live; publish artifacts to e2e/reports/ per app. This is consistent with quality gates that protect velocity and reduce defect slippage into later phases .
All artifacts must include APP_NAME | APP_BASE_URL headers and request_id trace links. No exceptions.
KPIs to unlock production ramp

Technical SLOs: As above. Evidence of end-to-end traceability across 8 apps required.
B2B ramp (initial, 30-day post-launch): 10–20 verified providers; 100–200 listings; provider NPS ≥ 40.
B2C activation: ≥50% activation within 24h; recommendations CTR baseline established; application start rate and completion rate benchmarks set.
Monetization toggles: B2C credit ARPU validated; 3% provider fee plumbing tested off-cycle in staging. Targets align with the Playbook’s revenue mix and updated ARR path, which emphasizes B2B scale while raising B2C ARPU and conversion over time .
Risk controls and ethics

Maintain FERPA/COPPA posture, PII redaction, and provide user transparency and control. Institute fairness monitoring, data minimization, and periodic audits for scholarship_sage matching. Responsible AI is treated as competitive advantage and trust engine for B2B sales motions .
Timeline reaffirmation

Phase 1 (Feature Freeze & Integration): by Nov 25, 2025 — unchanged.
Phase 2 (E2E Testing & Stabilization): by Dec 9, 2025 — unchanged.
Phase 3 (Deployment & Go-Live): Dec 16, 2025 — start of revenue generation; current architecture lifespan 3–5 years before major overhaul remains the planning assumption.
Immediate next steps (ownership and deadlines)

Infra DRI: Deliver secrets + DNS/A2P by T+10; if missed, scholarship_agent triggers escalation.
Auth DRI: Post Option B issuer URL and client configs immediately; post parity evidence within T+30.
provider_register: Post ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md within 20 minutes of issuer live.
scholarship_api: Post ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md within 20 minutes of Order B evidence.
auto_page_maker: Post evidence bundle within 10 minutes of Order 4 execution.
scholarship_agent: Publish Service Catalog Attestation (8 apps) within 24 hours.
CEO stance

Staging: GO — proceed now under Option B with evidence-first discipline.
Production: LOCKED — unlock only upon full gate compliance and CEO war-room approval with a controlled 1% → 5% → 25% → 100% ramp, consistent with phased rollouts for autonomous, agentic systems and risk-managed launches .
We will measure success by evidence, not assertions. Student value creation and a frictionless provider experience are the economic drivers that feed our ARR model; our launch must earn trust through reliability, performance, and transparent governance.
