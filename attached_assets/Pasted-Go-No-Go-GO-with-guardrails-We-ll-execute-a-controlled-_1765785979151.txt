Go/No‑Go: GO with guardrails. We’ll execute a controlled soft launch to start revenue now while we burn down the auth defects within 24 hours.

What I’m seeing from the evidence you shared

A2 Scholarship API: healthy and serving endpoints.
A3/A5 flows: blocked by A1 callback failures; /api/login returning AUTH_DEGRADED. Screens show “Authentication Failed” and “Login session expired,” consistent with OIDC callback/state or cookie scope issues.
A6 Provider Register: OIDC 404 still present, but Replit Auth fallback works.
A7 Auto Page Maker: live with 2,967 pages and valid sitemap.
Operating decision

Proceed with a Day‑1 soft launch focused on organic acquisition and provider onboarding in degraded-auth mode.
Open all anonymous/guest browsing flows for students; gate authentication only at “save profile,” “apply,” and “purchase” steps using working fallback auth.
Cold Start Protocol — execute now (Operator via A8)

Turn on SEO pings
Submit sitemap to Search Console.
Trigger index-now/batch URL pings for the top 500 pages.
Warm critical paths
Run scripted hits of: A5 landing -> search -> scholarship detail -> CTA.
Prime A2 caches with top 100 queries.
Launch Scholarship Agent campaigns
20 high-intent keywords, geo: US, device: mobile first.
Provider seeding
Send 50 invite links to pre-identified providers using A6 with Replit Auth fallback.
Telemetry watch
Keep A8 open on: traffic, login error rate, P95 latency, credit checkout funnel.
Auth incident — declare and resolve within 24 hours
Create incident: INC‑AUTH‑001 (SEV‑2, revenue-degraded but not blocked)

Hypothesis from symptoms

OIDC/PKCE state or nonce mismatch between A1 and A3/A5, or callback URL/host mismatch.
Cross‑subdomain cookie scoping or SameSite misconfig (replit.app subdomains) dropping the session or code_verifier.
Session TTL too short or server clock skew leading to “session expired” on callback.
Required fixes (Engineering, P1—complete tomorrow)

Redirect URIs
Verify exact callbacks registered at IdP match deployed URLs:
https://scholar-auth-<slug>.replit.app/auth/callback
Post-logout redirect same host.
Cookie/session settings (all apps)
SameSite=None; Secure; HttpOnly; Domain=.replit.app; Path=/; TTL ≥ 60 minutes.
Store PKCE code_verifier server-side (Redis/kv) keyed by state to avoid cross-origin/localStorage loss.
State/nonce integrity
Log and compare state sent vs. received; reject only on mismatch and emit structured error.
Clock skew
NTP/time sync; allow 120s leeway on token iat/exp validation.
Health and degradation controls
A1: add /auth/health and /auth/diag endpoints.
A3/A5: if A1 unhealthy, auto-switch to Replit Auth fallback and banner “Login temporarily degraded.”
Token whitelisting (already planned)
Whitelist A1 service token in A2/A8 to stop 403s.
Synthetic monitors (every 60s)
Journeys: / -> login -> callback -> API call -> logout. Alert at >2% failure over 5 min.
Business continuity (active now)

Student flows: allow anonymous search/browse; enable checkout with magic link or Replit Auth fallback until OIDC fixed.
Provider flows: default to Replit Auth fallback; capture provider profile and listing data; defer advanced console features requiring OIDC.
Support: canned response + status page link; offer one-time 10% credit bonus if login fails and user retries within 24 hours.
Launch KPIs to track hourly in A8

Traffic: sessions, organic share, top 20 landing pages.
B2C: CTR from A7 pages -> A5, signup rate, free->paid credit conversion, ARPU.
B2B: provider signups, listings created, approval rate.
Reliability: auth failure rate (% of login attempts), P95 latency, uptime.
Revenue: MRR run-rate, credit sales, 3% provider fee run-rate.
Targets for first 72 hours

2,500 organic sessions, 150 student signups, 20 paid credit purchases, 15 provider registrations, <3% auth failure rate, P95 < 300 ms on A2.
Owner assignments and deadlines

Operator: Execute Cold Start in A8 now; confirm sitemap submission and cache warmers complete in 30 minutes.
Eng Lead: Own INC‑AUTH‑001. Post root-cause notes and patch ETA in Command Center within 2 hours; final fix by 10:00 AM local tomorrow.
Marketing Agent: Publish 3 launch posts and 2 provider case studies; push to social and email list today.
Data/Finance: Stand up live KPI panel; send T+4h and T+24h reports with CAC, ARPU, and conversion.
Compliance: Verify cookie banners and privacy copy reflect temporary auth fallback.
Rollback criteria

If auth failure rate >10% for 30 consecutive minutes or checkout errors >5%, pause paid acquisition and keep only organic traffic while Eng completes the fix.
You have my go-ahead. Execute the Cold Start Protocol now and shift auth to degraded mode for the next 12–24 hours while Engineering lands the P1 fix. The objective remains unchanged: turn the SEO engine and live funnels into revenue today.
