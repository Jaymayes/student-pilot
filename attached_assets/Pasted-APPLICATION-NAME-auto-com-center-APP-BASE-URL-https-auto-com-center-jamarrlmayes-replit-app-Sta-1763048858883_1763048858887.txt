APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Pending Operator Publish)

Summary

Proof-of-control file prepared in workspace; expected endpoint after publish: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/ceo.txt Expected body: ceo_nonce=acc-2025-11-13-7c9e1f11
Current blocker is purely operational: the workspace snapshot has not been published to production.
Blockers

Section IV.A.1 Security & Compliance: Public proof-of-control not yet verifiable at the production URL because the current workspace snapshot has not been published.
Operational Constraint: Agent3 cannot switch Repls or click Publish in Replit. Human Operator action required.
Immediate Executive Directives (Do Now)
Owner: Operator
Deadline: within 15 minutes of receipt

Open the auto_com_center Repl in Replit.
Confirm file exists and content matches exactly: Path: /.well-known/ceo.txt (or public/.well-known/ceo.txt per project config) Content: ceo_nonce=acc-2025-11-13-7c9e1f11
Click Publish/Deploy to create a new production snapshot.
Reply with publish timestamp and snapshot ID.
Owner: Agent3 (auto_com_center DRI)
Start: immediately upon operator confirmation

T+5 minutes: • Verify nonce URL returns HTTP 200 and exact body. • Capture publish timestamp and snapshot ID in the evidence log.
T+2 hours: • Run production smoke tests and compile evidence package:
Security & Compliance: MFA/SSO via scholar_auth; RBAC checks by role; TLS endpoints; audit logging writes and retrieval; session/token hygiene.
Scalability & Performance: baseline P95/P99 latencies, CPU/mem headroom; load-balancer health; error rate <1%.
Integration & Interoperability: round-trip with scholar_auth (AuthN), role-scoped calls to scholarship_api (as applicable), event/webhook flows, email/send queue if applicable to comms.
Reliability & DR: backup/restore runbook, RTO/RPO, alerts wired, on-call rotation documented.
Code Quality & Docs: API/route docs, config matrix, environment parity notes, rollout/rollback plan.
Testing: functional/security/perf/UAT summaries; integration test results across the 7-app ecosystem touchpoints relevant to auto_com_center. • Publish External Service Status page link and monitoring dashboard link.
Estimated Go-Live Date

If Publish is completed within the next 15 minutes:
Go-Live Ready evidence package by: 2025-11-13 20:00 UTC
CEO Go/No-Go decision gate: 2025-11-13 20:15 UTC
If Publish slips beyond 60 minutes, new target: 2025-11-14 16:00 UTC
ARR Ignition

Initial contribution begins upon activation of scheduled outbound communications and workflow automations in production:
Target ARR ignition: 2025-11-14 (within 24 hours post go-live), driven by increased B2C re-engagement and B2B provider activation throughput governed by auto_com_center cadences.
Third-Party Dependencies

No new third-party services required for this publish.
Continues to depend on:
scholar_auth for SSO/MFA and RBAC assertions.
Existing hosting/monitoring stack used across the ecosystem (unchanged).
Existing email/comms channel(s) if configured for outbound notifications.
Status: Operational; validation to be included in the T+2h evidence.
Go-Live Criteria (must all pass)

Security: MFA/SSO flows succeed; least-privilege RBAC enforced; audit logs written and queryable; TLS A-grade.
Performance: P95 ≤ 120 ms, error rate < 1% under baseline load; health checks green across instances.
Reliability: Rollback verified; backups taken; alerts firing to on-call; uptime target 99.9% SLO configured.
Integration: AuthN/AuthZ end-to-end with scholar_auth; required API calls authorized and scoped; comms queues healthy.
UX/Admin: Admin controls visible and functional for policy, permissions, and monitoring.
Risk and Mitigations

Risk: Workspace mismatch or failure to publish. Mitigation: Operator checklist above; capture snapshot ID; verify URL within 5 minutes.
Risk: Post-publish route precedence causing .well-known intercepts. Mitigation: Ensure static route for /.well-known is registered before dynamic/OIDC routes; confirm with live probe.
Risk: Latency above 120ms P95. Mitigation: scale-up policy and cache headers; fast rollback if thresholds breached.
CEO Decision and Accountability

Decision: Proceed with immediate Operator Publish to unblock production verification.
Accountability:
Operator: Complete publish and provide timestamp/snapshot ID.
Agent3 (DRI): Deliver verification within 5 minutes of publish; full evidence within 2 hours; remediate any critical gaps same day.
CEO will hold Go/No-Go at the stated decision gate based on evidence against the criteria above.
Next Update cadence

Operator: confirm publish within 15 minutes.
Agent3: post T+5 min nonce verification, then T+2h evidence package and dashboard links.
CEO: final go/no-go and ARR ignition confirmation thereafter.
Prime Directive Alignment

This action directly supports low-CAC, scalable growth by enabling autonomous communications that drive B2C conversion/retention and B2B provider activation, moving us toward profitable ARR and market leadership.
Standing by for Operator publish confirmation.
