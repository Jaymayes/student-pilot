CEO DECISION MEMO — Operation Synergy FOC

Executive summary

B2C engine stays live: student_pilot, scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, auto_page_maker are GO. Observe-only posture remains for all comms.
Two gating items to FOC: (1) provider_register OAuth client resolution; (2) auto_com_center canary GREEN.
Prime Directive alignment: We continue to maximize low-CAC SEO growth while protecting regulatory posture and brand by holding comms in observe-only until proven GREEN.
Gate calls (current)

scholar_auth: GO (conditional). Action: issue temp client for provider_register (below).
scholarship_api: GO (unconditional).
scholarship_sage: GO (unconditional).
student_pilot: GO (live).
provider_register: NO-GO pending OAuth client fix.
auto_page_maker: GO (live; SEO engine).
scholarship_agent: READY, observe-only.
auto_com_center: NO-GO (hard gate; canary required).
Immediate orders and SLAs

War-room: provider_register OAuth (SLA: 15 minutes)
Decision: Resolve now with a new temporary client to eliminate ambiguity.
Auth DRI — do within 5 minutes:
Register client:
client_name: provider_register_temp_war_room
redirect_uris:
https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/auth/callback
https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/callback
require_pkce: true (S256)
grant_types: authorization_code, refresh_token
scopes: openid, email, profile, roles, offline_access
token_endpoint_auth_method: client_secret_post
expiry: 24 hours
CORS allow-origin: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app (credentials allowed)
Deliver client_id and secret to provider_register DRI via the approved secure channel.
provider_register DRI — complete within 10 minutes of receipt:
Execute 5-minute PKCE round-trip:
/authorize → /token with S256
Validate ID token: iss, aud, sub, email, roles includes Provider
Submit evidence bundle (HAR + decoded JWT + server logs with request_id) and SHA256 manifest.
Acceptance to close war-room (T+15):
200 OK ID token with aud = provider_register_temp_war_room (or new client_id) and roles contains Provider
Session established; RBAC check yields 403 for non-Provider routes
One successful logout + refresh_token rotation verified
Root-cause note: Historic mismatch between /auth/callback and /api/callback is a likely contributor. Adding both URIs removes this class of failure.
2. auto_com_center canary (SLA: start at T+90; 120-minute DRY-RUN only after GREEN)

Hard gate remains NO-GO until exact GREEN criteria are met:
Zero loss at 2× peak (60,000 events @ 1000/min)
P95 dispatch latency <250ms
Heap <85% sustained under load
DLQ = 0 (no growth)
Error ≤0.1%
Opt-out processed <5s with evidence
Rollback plan SHA256-verified
If GREEN: Execute 120-minute DRY-RUN immediately and produce 10-artifact evidence bundle within 30 minutes post-run.
If RED: Observe-only; deliver root cause and next tuning window in 60 minutes.
Tuning directives if heap pressure recurs:
Cap consumer concurrency to match CPU cores with 1.2× backoff
Enable explicit GC tuning and heap dump on threshold breach
Apply backpressure at ingress (rate-limit + token bucket) tied to queue depth
Set circuit breaker trip at 2× baseline P95 for 3 consecutive minutes; auto-recover on 5 consecutive green minutes
B2C engine: 24-hour readout (owner: Product/Analytics Lead)

Deliver within 24 hours:
Sign-ups; Activation rate; Search→apply CTR; Recommendations CTR
Free→paid conversion; ARPU per credit
SEO-assisted conversions (auto_page_maker → student_pilot)
CWV/Lighthouse snapshots for key pages
Targets (initial):
Free→paid conversion baseline ≥3.0% week 1, grow to 4.5% by day 30
ARPU per credit: baseline ≥$6; 10% uplift by day 60 via bundles
SEO-assisted conversions: ≥25% of new sign-ups; CTR ≥3.5% on top 100 pages
P95 latency guardrail: ≤120ms across B2C surfaces (all apps)
Financial and KPI alignment to $10M ARR

B2C:
Organic acquisition: Prioritize Auto Page Maker output velocity and indexation quality. CAC target: <$2 incremental; maintain CWV “good” status.
Monetization: 4× markup on AI services; weekly price testing queued post-comms GREEN via feature flags.
B2B:
Provider on-platform: 25 active providers by end of Q1; 3% platform fee tracked; ensure provider_register is unblocked within today’s war-room window.
Operating margin:
Maintain 99.9% uptime and ~120ms P95 to protect conversion and support margins.
Risk and compliance posture

FERPA/COPPA/GDPR: Zero tolerance for violations. No production comms until auto_com_center GREEN. Opt-out <5s must be demonstrable.
Responsible AI: Explainability enforced in scholarship_sage (matchReasons). No academic dishonesty enablement. Bias monitoring staged for narrative-signal experiments (post-FOC).
Lifecycle and refresh windows (for planning; confirm in Section 7 reports)

Infrastructure (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center): 5–7 years runway; plan major refresh Q1 2031–Q3 2032.
User-facing (student_pilot, provider_register): 3–4 years; UX overhaul planning window opens in 2028.
Intelligence/automation (scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker): 2–3 years; staged refresh by 2027–2028.
Pre-approved budgets:
auto_page_maker refresh reserve: $40–60k in Q2 2027 (SSR/SSG + algo shock hedging)
scholarship_sage narrative-signal program: $50k in 2027 (feature-flagged with fairness guardrails)
Reporting discipline and next checkpoints

30-minute cadence continues from all DRIs until FOC.
Evidence must be SHA256-verified, include request_id correlation, and standardized error formats.
No schema/API changes until FOC; configuration-only changes allowed for unblockers and evidence capture.
Action items by owner

Auth DRI: Create and deliver temp OAuth client to provider_register within 5 minutes; confirm CORS for provider_register; stand by for live debug.
provider_register DRI: Complete PKCE round-trip within 10 minutes of client receipt; submit SHA256-verifiable evidence; begin 90-minute E2E if GO.
auto_com_center DRI + Comms Infra: Run T+90 canary to exact gates; GREEN → 120-minute DRY-RUN; RED → root cause + retune window in 60 minutes.
Product/Analytics Lead: 24-hour funnel and SEO readout with targets vs actuals.
CEO directive to Agent3 instances

Identify your APP_BASE_URL, execute only your application’s directives, and submit Section 7 using the mandatory format within your next cadence update. If you are the provider_register or scholar_auth DRI, the 15-minute war-room SLA supersedes all other tasks until closed.
FOC status today

System FOC remains NO-GO pending: (1) provider_register OAuth completion; (2) auto_com_center GREEN.
B2C engine remains LIVE to advance ARR with low-CAC growth while we protect compliance and brand.
Act with urgency. Time-to-green on these two gates is now the critical path to our Prime Directive.
