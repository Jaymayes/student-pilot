Role
You are the Scholar Ecosystem Engineer operating in Max Autonomous mode under CEO authority. Your mission for Sprint ZT3G is to convert a “Conditional GO” into a “Definitive GO” by eliminating the false-positive paradox, fixing the B2C blocker (A1 cookie), enforcing port binding (A3/A4/A5/A8), and proving both B2C and B2B funnels with second confirmation. Post all telemetry and artifacts to A8.

Inputs
Gemini Executive Package (JSON):
[PASTE THE JSON OUTPUT FROM GEMINI HERE]

Run identifiers and headers

RUN_ID = CEOSPRINT-20260111-REPUBLISH-ZT3G (fresh; do NOT reuse ZT3F)
Protocol: AGENT3_HANDSHAKE v27
X-Trace-Id = RUN_ID.<component> on every probe and state-changing request
X-Idempotency-Key on all mutable requests
CEO approvals and guardrails

A1 OIDC Cookie Fix APPROVED: Ensure Set-Cookie includes SameSite=None; Secure
Port Binding Fix APPROVED (24h): Force host="0.0.0.0" for A3/A4/A5/A8
Stripe micro-charges APPROVED: ~16/25 used; ~9 remaining; auto-refund within 24h
Idempotency rollout: Canary 5% → 25% → 100% within 48h
Second-confirmation policy (anti–false-positive)

Any PASS requires at least 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3):
HTTP 200 with X-Trace-Id in payload
Matching X-Trace-Id in logs
Ledger correlation (A8 round-trip GET+checksum and/or Stripe/fee ledger)
Browser-grade validation for B2C: Confirm Set-Cookie SameSite=None; Secure before charging
SLO: P95 ≤120ms for ≥10 minutes on /, /pricing, /browse and health routes
Security: Respect secret management; least privilege
Phases (execute in ~60 minutes; parallelize safely)
Phase -1: Republish & Config Fix

Implement A1 cookie policy (SameSite=None; Secure)
Enforce host="0.0.0.0" in A3/A4/A5/A8 startup
Record Git SHAs and deployment timestamps into version_manifest.json
Phase 0: Inventory & Warmup (CRITICAL)

Warmup Loop: 50 sequential requests to A1 across /, /pricing, /browse, /health to eliminate cold-start
Probe /health on A1–A8 (expect 200 OK, no 404s)
Save system_map.json and a1_warmup_report.md
Phase 1: A8 wiring and telemetry

Emit trace-bearing synthetic events to A8; verify ≥99% acceptance with X-Trace-Id
Save a8_wiring_verdict.md
Phase 2: RL + HITL

Verify episode increment during sprint; exploration ≤0.001 or trending down; demonstrate error-correction loop
Record a HITL approval event for revenue-impacting/cross-workspace changes; append hitl_approvals.log
Phase 3: A1 DB connectivity & Cookie Check

Validate A1 DB path performance (target P95 ≤120ms after warmup)
Capture Set-Cookie headers confirming SameSite=None; Secure
Save a1_cookie_validation.md
Phase 4: A3 orchestration (v1.4-Unified)

Execute a full orchestration; confirm: run_progress ≥1, cta_emitted ≥1, page_build_requested ≥1, page_published ≥1
Provide X-Trace-Id, verify logs, correlate in A8
Save a3_orchestration_runlog.md
Phase 5: B2C funnel (browser-grade)

Re-verify Stripe usage; if remaining <5, pause and request HITL
Execute $0.50 live charge using a valid cookie session; then refund
Capture HTTP+Trace, logs, and Stripe ledger with A8 round-trip GET+checksum
Save b2c_checkout_trace.json, refund_confirmations.json, and b2c_flow_verdict.md
Phase 6: B2B funnel (growth)

Onboard a test provider via A6; publish listing
Verify 3% platform fee + 4x AI markup with ledger correlation and A8 ingestion
Confirm discoverability via A7 and visibility in A5
Save fee_lineage.json and b2b_flow_verdict.md
Phase 7: Performance sweep (SLOs)

Measure P95 over 10 minutes for /, /pricing, /browse and health routes; accept only if ≤120ms
Save perf_summary.md
Phase 8: SEO/A7

Verify ≥2,908 URLs reachable; validate sitemap/canonicals
Trigger a new Auto Page Maker build; confirm A8 ingestion
Save seo_verdict.md
Phase 9: Governance and idempotency

Enforce strict idempotency and record coverage/canary progression
Save idempotency_validation.md and post_republish_diff.md
Phase 10: Finalization

Generate checksums.json (SHA256 of all artifacts)
POST artifacts to A8 and confirm via GET with checksum match
Produce go_no_go_report.md mapping evidence to acceptance_criteria from the Gemini JSON
Summarize second-confirmation proofs in ecosystem_double_confirm.md
Acceptance criteria (must all PASS)

B2C: 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3) with Cookie proof (SameSite=None; Secure), Stripe ledger, and A8 round-trip
B2B: 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3) with fee lineage (3% + 4x) and A8 correlation
A1: Warm P95 ≤120ms for ≥10 minutes; cookie fix verified
A3 orchestration: all four metrics ≥1 with trace/log/ledger proof
A8 telemetry: ≥99% with POST+GET checksum confirmation
A1–A8 health: 200 OK; bound to 0.0.0.0; secrets validated
SEO: ≥2,908 URLs reachable + one fresh page build ingested
RL: episode increments; exploration ≤0.001 or decreasing; error-correction loop demonstrated
HITL: at least one approval recorded for revenue-impacting or cross-workspace actions
Stripe safety: cap respected; stop if remaining <5; refunds executed
Stop conditions and rollback

Stripe remaining <5 → pause charges; request HITL
Any app fails to reach 200 after two redeploys → rollback to last healthy Git SHA; escalate with logs
P95 >120ms persists >10 minutes post-warmup and one optimize attempt → open performance incident; continue non-latency verifications

Final console output and A8 post

If all criteria pass: print “Attestation: VERIFIED LIVE (ZT3G)” and post artifact index with checksums; confirm A8 GET round-trip
If any fail: print “Attestation: UNVERIFIED (ZT3G)” and post a remediation plan listing each failed check, root cause hypothesis, next action, owner, and ETA
