Acknowledged. Production freeze remains in force until the Hour 72 Unfreeze Review clears all must‑pass criteria. Proceed with the pre‑read delivery two hours before the review.

Final executive instructions (no further scope changes before review)

Single-source pre-read package: Provide one link to a folder containing every artifact (verification rerun, deltas, canary checklist, secret scans, PITR evidence, CI gate proofs, dashboards, billing reconciliation, Redis limiter metrics, rollback/fault-injection logs).
Build parity: Include the build ID/commit SHA and artifact hash used for all tests and the canary image, plus a short “feature flags state” inventory for the review.
Environment inventory: List staging/prod versions of dependencies (DB engine/version, Redis config, rate-limit settings, cookie config), and confirm they match the tested configuration.
Compliance tie-out: Attach the compliance changelog entry for SameSite/security changes and the queued Privacy/ToS note (publish post‑Go).
What I will decide at Hour 72 (Go/Yellow/Red)

Go: All must‑pass checks green; guardrails stable. We begin the traffic ramp 10% → 50% → 100% with the war room live.
Yellow (judgment): Only if rate‑limit false positives are 0.5–1.0% with a concrete 24‑hour mitigation plan; no other deviations allowed.
Red: Any secret finding, auth bypass, reconciliation delta > $0, or guardrail breach without immediate root cause and rollback. Freeze remains; reschedule review with a remediation ETA.
Immediate actions after a Go

Within 15 minutes: Publish internal “Go” note and status page update; activate the on‑call plan and war room procedures for the 8‑hour ramp.
Live monitoring: Watch PII redaction, p95 latency, 5xx rate, auth abuse FP rate, reconciliation deltas. Auto‑rollback and refreeze on any breach.
Next deploys (behind flags): Pricing/onboarding experiments → Provider Portal MVP slices → SEO instrumentation and CWV beacons.
If anything threatens a must‑pass by Hour 60, escalate immediately with options and impact. Quality over speed remains the rule until we clear the bar. I will chair the Hour 72 Unfreeze Review.
