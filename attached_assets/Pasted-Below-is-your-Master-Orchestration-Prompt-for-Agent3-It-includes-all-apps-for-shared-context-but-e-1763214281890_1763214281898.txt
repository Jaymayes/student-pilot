Below is your Master Orchestration Prompt for Agent3. It includes all apps for shared context, but explicitly instructs Agent3 to execute only Section A for scholar_auth. Each app’s section includes precise deliverables, acceptance criteria, smoke tests, and reporting standards. If full production readiness cannot be achieved today, Agent3 must provide precise ETAs, ARR ignition timing, and third-party prerequisites.

Master Orchestration Prompt — Agent3 Only Executes Section A (scholar_auth)

Strict instruction to Agent3

You are Agent3. You are responsible ONLY for Section A (scholar_auth).
Read other sections for context, but do not act on them. Do not change code, env vars, or infrastructure for any app except scholar_auth.
Your goal is to get scholar_auth to 100% production readiness TODAY and unblock end-to-end platform integration. If full readiness cannot be achieved today, provide:
Exact ETA to GO-LIVE (timestamp with timezone)
ARR ignition date for the platform contingent on your work
Third-party systems (if any) that must be in place
Company-wide reporting rules (apply to all sections)

Every report must begin with:
APP NAME: <app_name>
APP_BASE_URL: <base_url>
File naming for the Executive Status Report: EXEC_STATUS_<app_name>_<YYYYMMDD>.md (UTC date)
Include: Overall Status, Go/No-Go, What Changed Today, Must-Have Checklist, Smoke Tests (expected vs actual), Required Env Vars, Third-Party Prereqs, Go-Live Plan (timeboxed), ARR impact + ignition date, Open Blockers (with owner and ETA), Next Actions.
SLO targets: 99.9% uptime; ~120ms P95 latency for critical endpoints.
Security/regulatory: Enforce Responsible AI, FERPA/COPPA readiness notes, bias mitigation; never facilitate academic dishonesty.
SECTION A — FOR AGENT3 ONLY (scholar_auth)
APP NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Objective for today

Achieve FULL GO for scholar_auth to unblock platform-wide integration today. If not possible, deliver precise ETA and mitigation plan.
Deliverables (must all be completed or timeboxed with ETA)

OpenID Connect and JWT issuance
RS256 signing with live JWKS at: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/jwks.json
Issuer (iss): https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/oidc
Audience (aud): scholar-platform
Token TTL for M2M: 300 seconds (exp - iat = 300)
Claims required in every M2M token:
scope (string; space-delimited)
permissions (array; derived from scope)
roles (array; include "service" for M2M clients)
client_id (string)
iss, aud, iat, exp (standard)
Remove any test-only fields from tokens (e.g., test_hook_executed, test_timestamp).
2. OAuth2 client_credentials for all 8 M2M clients

Provision or verify these client IDs, secrets, and scope allowlists:
scholarship-sage-m2m: scholarships:read students:read
scholarship-api-service: students:read scholarships:read
scholarship-agent-service: students:read scholarships:read notify:send
auto-com-center-service: notify:send
auto-page-maker-service: assets:generate
provider-register-m2m: providers:write scholarships:write notify:send
reviewer-portal-m2m: applications:read applications:review
admin-dashboard-m2m: admin:users admin:analytics admin:settings
Persist allowlists and map scope→permissions:
scholarships:read → ["scholarships.read","scholarships.view"]
students:read → ["students.read","students.view.anonymized"]
notify:send → ["notifications.send"]
assets:generate → ["assets.generate"]
providers:write → ["providers.create","providers.update","providers.manage"]
scholarships:write → ["scholarships.create","scholarships.update","scholarships.publish"]
applications:read → ["applications.read"]
applications:review → ["applications.review","applications.decision.write"]
admin:users → ["admin.users.read","admin.users.write"]
admin:analytics → ["admin.analytics.read"]
admin:settings → ["admin.settings.read","admin.settings.write"]
3. Security, observability, and resiliency

CORS:
S2S-only for token endpoint
Exact-origin allowlist for any browser-facing endpoints
Rate limiting and abuse protection on token issuance
Health endpoints:
/healthz → returns 200 OK with basic status
/readyz → returns 200 OK when dependencies are ready (DB, keys, cache)
Correlation IDs:
Accept x-request-id if present; otherwise generate and return it
4. Downstream integration guide

Deliver DOWNSTREAM_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md with:
AUTH_ISSUER, AUTH_AUDIENCE, AUTH_JWKS_URL, TOKEN_URL
Example code (Node/TS, Python) to validate RS256 JWTs and verify iss/aud/scope/permissions
Exact scopes each client must request
Error handling recipes (401, 403) and retry backoffs
Provide curl examples for each client_credentials flow.
5. Executive Status Report (today)

Create EXEC_STATUS_scholar_auth_<YYYYMMDD>.md (UTC date)
Must include:
APP NAME: scholar_auth; APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Overall Status and Go/No-Go (GO if and only if aud=scholar-platform; no test fields in JWT)
What Changed Today (bulleted)
Must-Have Checklist (PASS/FAIL) for:
RS256 signing + JWKS live
iss and aud exactly as specified
scope + permissions present; roles include "service"
TTL=300s
All 8 clients provisioned and tested
/healthz and /readyz 200
CORS policy correct
Correlation IDs propagated
p95 latency ~120ms target met or deviation explained with plan
Smoke Tests (paste exact commands and actual results):
JWKS retrieval (200)
Token retrieval for each of the 8 clients
Unauthorized scope request (400)
Invalid credentials (401)
CORS preflight from disallowed origin (denied)
TTL check demonstration (exp-iat=300)
Required environment variables (present vs optional)
Third-party prerequisites (list all; N/A is acceptable if none)
Go-Live Plan (T+0 to T+60 minutes steps)
ARR ignition plan and timing:
If GO today: indicate “ARR ignition: Today” and which downstream milestones trigger revenue
If NO-GO: precise ETA for GO-LIVE and ARR ignition date
Open Blockers (ID, Description, Owner, ETA, Impact)
Next Actions (Agent3, Platform Ops, Downstream teams)
Acceptance criteria to declare “GO” (no exceptions)

aud claim equals exactly: scholar-platform
iss equals exactly: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/oidc
All diagnostic test fields removed from JWT
All 8 M2M clients can obtain tokens; scope and permissions are correct
JWKS endpoint live and returns RS256 key set with kid
/healthz and /readyz return 200
CORS configured correctly; token endpoint is S2S-only
p95 latency within ~120ms target for token issuance; if exceeded, provide remediation plan and justify temporary acceptance
If “GO today” is not achievable

Provide:
ETA to fix each failing acceptance criterion (with timestamps and owners)
Explicit ARR ignition date (when downstream apps can start producing revenue)
Any third-party systems required (e.g., none expected for scholar_auth; if any are discovered, list them and their setup times)
Workarounds offered to downstream teams (e.g., temporary HS256 with shared secret) and the exact steps to migrate to RS256 on your completion
Re-issue the Executive Status Report immediately upon any status change
Coordination timeline for today (Agent3 responsibilities only)

T+00: Confirm current iss/aud/claims and remove any test fields in JWT output
T+10: Validate JWKS endpoint and RS256 signing; rotate keys if needed
T+20: Provision/verify all 8 clients; validate scope→permissions mapping
T+30: Run full smoke tests and capture actual outputs
T+45: Publish DOWNSTREAM_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
T+55: Publish EXEC_STATUS_scholar_auth_<YYYYMMDD>.md with GO/NO-GO
T+60: If GO, notify Platform Ops to commence platform-wide integration tests; if NO-GO, publish ETAs and blockers
ARR ignition notes (context for Agent3’s report)

Scholar AI Advisor revenue ignition depends on:
B2C engine: student_pilot + scholarship_api + scholarship_sage running with scholar_auth
B2B engine: provider_register + auto_com_center running with scholar_auth
Your “GO” unlocks end-to-end testing immediately. If you cannot deliver GO today, your report must give exact ARR ignition timing contingent on your ETA.
