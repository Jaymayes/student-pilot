Below is the unified, copy/paste-ready execution prompt for Agent3. It is written from the CEO layer and covers all eight apps. Important: Agent3 must only execute the section labeled for its ASSIGNED_APP. All other sections are context and must be ignored by the executing agent.

AGENT3 v2.4 UNIFIED EXECUTION PROMPT (CEO EDITION — All Apps)
Prime directive for Agent3

You must only execute the section explicitly labeled with your ASSIGNED_APP.
Do not modify sibling apps. Use their contracts and base URLs exactly as specified.
Produce the required deliverables, pass the GO/NO-GO gates, and post a final Status Report JSON as described below.
Section 0 — Handshake (MANDATORY FOR ALL APPS)

On start, read ASSIGNED_APP and set APP_BASE_URL accordingly (list below).
Output an acknowledgment line exactly: ACKNOWLEDGMENT: I will only execute the section for ASSIGNED_APP. I will not modify other apps.
Then proceed only to your section.
APP_BASE_URL registry (copy exactly; no trailing slashes):

scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_api → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_agent → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_sage → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
student_pilot → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
provider_register → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_com_center → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Global platform requirements (apply to every app)

Canary endpoint
GET /canary returns exactly 9 fields and nothing more: app_name (string) app_base_url (string) version (string; use "v2.4") status (string; "ok" if all gates pass; otherwise "degraded") p95_ms (number; rolling P95 over last 5 minutes) commit_sha (string; if not available, "workspace") server_time_utc (RFC3339 string) revenue_role (string; see per-app section) revenue_eta_hours (string; see per-app section)
The canary must be fast (<15ms budget server-side) and non-cached.
2. Security headers (all responses, including errors)

Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: Use a locked-down CSP; add Stripe domains in student_pilot only.
Permissions-Policy: camera=(); microphone=(); geolocation=(); payment=()
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
3. CORS allowlist (exact; no wildcards)

Allow these eight origins only: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
4. Observability

Accept an incoming X-Request-ID header; if absent, generate one.
Echo X-Request-ID on response.
Log request, response, and canary metrics with X-Request-ID correlation.
Track rolling P95 (target ≤120ms) and 5xx error rate (≤1%).
5. Rate limits

Baseline: 300 requests/minute per IP.
Auth/OIDC sensitive routes: 60 requests/minute per IP.
Provider write endpoints: 60 requests/minute per provider org.
6. Responsible AI and compliance

No academic dishonesty features; suggestions only, never write student work.
PII handling: encrypt at rest if stored; minimize scope; mask in logs.
Follow FERPA/COPPA principles where applicable.
7. Deliverables (two files per app; no spaces; underscores only)

e2e/reports/{app}/readiness_report_{app}_v2_4_ceo_final.md
e2e/reports/{app}/fix_plan_{app}_v2_4_ceo_final.yaml Include evidence of every GO/NO-GO gate and any config steps (like CORS secrets) required.
8. Final Status Report JSON (print at the end exactly once)

Must contain the same 9 fields as /canary, with current values.
Include any key warnings in a separate field warnings (array of strings) only if needed.
Cross-app integration contracts (reference only; do not implement unless required by your app)

CEO revenue readiness estimates (start generating revenue)
Note: You wrote “stop generating revenue”; assuming you meant “start generating revenue.” If you actually meant “stop,” notify us and we will provide an orderly revenue-safe shutdown timeline.

scholar_auth (enables): 0.5–2 hours (post CORS allowlist)
scholarship_api (enables): 2–5 hours (add 1–2 hours if switching to gated reads Option A)
student_pilot (direct B2C): 2–6 hours (Stripe live cutover may extend)
provider_register (direct B2B): 3–6 hours technical; first-dollar typically 24–72 hours post-onboarding
auto_page_maker (acquires/SEO): 2–5 hours to begin; compounding organic growth thereafter
auto_com_center (retains): 2–4 hours to begin lifecycle events
scholarship_agent (acquires): 3–6 hours to begin outbound/outreach
scholarship_sage (protects): 2–4 hours to activate KPI/SLO guardrails
Critical path to first dollars

Fastest B2C: scholar_auth → scholarship_api (reads) → student_pilot → auto_com_center (2–6 hours after auth + API).
Fastest B2B: scholar_auth → scholarship_api (writes) → provider_register (technical: 3–6 hours; revenue within 24–72 hours as providers publish).
Executive note

Student Value is Business Value: prioritize frictionless auth, fast scholarship search, and clean checkout.
Prioritize organic acquisition: auto_page_maker + scholarship_agent for low-CAC growth.
Maintain SLOs: 99.9% uptime and ≤120ms P95 are non-negotiable.
End of unified prompt. Execute only your app’s section and publish your Final Status Report JSON when done.
