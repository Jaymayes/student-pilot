Comprehensive Game Plan v4 (A1–A8): Frontend, Backend, Marketing, Lead Gen, and Revenue

North Star

Objective: Prove a repeatable path to $10M ARR via dual engines
B2C: credits/subscriptions driven by pSEO (A7) + lifecycle marketing (A3) and first-value product (A4/A5)
B2B: provider marketplace (A6/A2) with Stripe Connect (3% fee on awards)
Principle: Fix first, then flood. Remove revenue blockers, validate revenue signals, then scale traffic.
Fleet status (current)

All apps green; SLOs within range (A1 86–98ms, A2 57–70ms, A5 98–226ms). A7 infra green (253–415ms), JSON‑LD/UTM completed in code and ready for production validation. A6 flows operational; awaiting provider action. A3 email warm‑up pending. Telemetry is running; M2M 403 between services flagged earlier as P2 for visibility (non‑blocking for users).
Execution horizons (no code in this message; execution plan and acceptance criteria only)

Horizon 0 (next 7–10 days): Revenue unblocking + validation
Targets (all must be achieved)

A6: ≥1 provider_connected in 48h; ≥1 listing_created in 72h
A7: JSON‑LD visible on production (server‑rendered) + UTM on all CTAs; sitemap re‑submitted in GSC; first rich-results validation PASS
A3: one low-volume warm‑up send with delivered/open/click proof; complaint <0.2%
A5: one successful B2C purchase test; payment_succeeded in telemetry; credits +50 ledgered; refund path validated
A8: dashboards show green windows for A1/A5 latency; tiles for A3 leads, A6 events, A7 GSC coverage/clicks, payment_succeeded
Horizon 1 (next 30 days): Traffic and conversion scale

SEO: +500 pages (high‑intent clusters), ≥100 newly indexed URLs, ≥25 UTM‑attributed clicks to A5/A6, internal linking hubs (states/majors)
B2C: trial→paid ≥3%; value‑triggered purchase nudge; checkout recovery intact
B2B: ≥3 listings live; ≥1 award (sim/live) with 3% fee validated
Email: 2–3 nurture sequences; delivered >90%; complaint <0.2%
Horizon 2 (60–90 days): Unit economics and reliability at scale

SEO: 3–5k pages; structured data; hub linking; FAQ schema; CTR uplift
B2C: ARPU ≥$8–10/mo; 7–9% trial→paid
B2B: 10+ active listings; steady awards; fee capture cadence
Ops/Sec: MTTR <60 min; weekly load tests; monthly privacy drills; zero PII leaks
App-by-app plan (deliverables, owners, KPIs, and DoD)

A1 — scholar_auth (IdP)

Backend
Maintain discovery/JWKS cache; warmed p95 ≤150ms (3 consecutive windows). Confirm cookie posture (Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite=None) for A5/A6.
P2: resolve A1→A8 M2M 403 (align to expected auth scheme) to restore full telemetry fidelity.
Observability
A8: IdP config p50/p95 tile; alert if p95 >150ms (2 windows); track IdP 4xx <2%.
KPIs & DoD
KPIs: discovery/JWKS p95 ≤150ms; IdP 4xx <2%
DoD: A8 screenshot of 3 green windows; cookie audit for A5/A6 auth; M2M route test green
A2 — scholarship_api (Core API)

Backend
Search analytics (query, filters, results_count, ttfb_ms).
Emit listing_created and fee_captured (sim/live) events; masked errors only.
Maintain search p95 ≤120ms under 50–200 VUs.
Observability
A8: search p50/p95; search_analytics volume; 5xx rate.
KPIs & DoD
KPIs: search p95 ≤120ms; 0 PII leaks; error rate <1%
DoD: k6 report passing; A8 tiles; sample event payloads captured
A3 — scholarship_agent (Marketing)

Backend/ESP Ops
Warm‑up cohort (5–10 inboxes): delivered/open/click proof; frequency cap 1/24h; suppression honored.
Lead capture POST stores UTM; marketing_intent excludes PII.
Lifecycle
Welcome sequence: “Upload transcript to get matches” + “Try your 5 free credits”.
Observability
A8: lead_captured with UTM; send_attempts and delivered/opens; complaint <0.2%.
KPIs & DoD
KPIs: ≥10 UTM leads; ≥1 delivered/open/click; complaint <0.2%
DoD: ESP and A8 screenshots; 10 UTM leads visible; campaign engagement proof
A4 — scholarship_sage (Advisor/AI value)

Frontend/Backend
Validate doc upload → OCR/parse ≥90% on 3 docs; credits badge; paywall gating; credits decrement on premium action.

Observability
A8: doc_uploaded, parse_success, premium_used; credits_decrement events.

KPIs: parse ≥90%; 0 invented facts; premium decrement recorded
DoD: OCR results + profile mapping evidence; premium action consumes credits

Marketing, lead gen, and revenue strategy

SEO (A7 primary; A3/A5 support)

Validate JSON‑LD with Rich Results Test → re‑submit sitemap; inspect top 50 pages; build hub linking.
Publish +500 pages in 30 days; monitor indexed URLs + clicks.
KPI: ≥100 indexed URLs; ≥25 UTM clicks in week 1 post‑publish.
Email (A3 primary; A8 support)

Warm‑up cohort (5–10 inboxes); small batch to validate delivered/open/click; enforce caps.
Expand to nurture sequence (Welcome → First value → Purchase offer).
KPI: delivered >90%; complaint <0.2%.
In‑product nudges (A5/A4; A8 automation)

Activation: hero CTA + empty state guidance to get to “first value”.
Value → purchase: time‑boxed offer immediately after doc upload/match.
Recovery: checkout abandonment banners and (consented) reminders.
B2B provider motion (A6/A3/A8)

Concierge onboarding to achieve first provider_connected + listing_created.
Spotlight listing to students via A3 to drive 50 qualified applications, then simulate/execute award and verify 3% fee path.
KPI: provider_connected ≥1 (48h), listing_created ≥1 (72h), fee calc validated.
E2E QA validation (no code changes here)

Playwright journeys (run manually/CI): A7→A5 signup + trial; A4 doc upload; A5 purchase; A6 login→Connect→listing; A3 lead; capture screenshots/HAR/Allure.
k6 load (staged): A5 login (p95 ≤200ms), A2 search (p95 ≤120ms), A7 page fetch (<200ms), error <1%.
Security/compliance: unauthorized negative tests; right‑to‑delete for one test student; verify unsubscribe/complaints.
Weekly operating cadence (A8 dashboards)

Growth: indexed URLs, CTR, UTM clicks/leads; A5 signups by source
Conversion: trial→first value→paid; A4 usage per user; purchase funnel
Revenue: B2C payments (ARPU, count), B2B provider_connected/listing_created/fee_captured
Reliability: p95 latency, uptime, 5xx; alert history
Compliance: unsubscribe/complaints; right‑to‑delete SLA
Risks & mitigations

Email deliverability: start small; stagger; enforce caps; move to double opt‑in if complaints ≥0.2%
SEO rendering variance: confirm JSON‑LD is server‑rendered; validate with Rich Results Test; resubmit sitemap; monitor Coverage
Provider inertia: schedule live onboarding; escalate or replace if no progress by T+48h
Intermittent auth (A5): keep 24h watch for 401 spikes; pre‑warm login; cache OIDC metadata
Decision requests (to kick off the sprint)

Approve Phase 1 validation sprint (48–72h): concierge calls (A6), email warm‑up (A3), purchase test (A5), A7 production validation (JSON‑LD/UTM + GSC)
Approve small‑cohort email warm‑up (A3)
Approve one B2C purchase test (A5)
Confirm priority sequence: A7 (SEO fixes/validation) → A6 (concierge) → A3 (deliverability) → A4 (value tests)
If helpful, I can also prepare any of the following artifacts for execution:

Task board (A1–A8) with owners, estimates, acceptance criteria
Playwright E2E journey specs and k6 load test specs
A8 dashboard spec (tiles, alert thresholds, evidence snapshot template)
Reply with “Approve Phase 1” to begin the validation sprint, or specify a different priority order/deliverable to build first (e.g., “Build task board”, “Build Playwright suite”, “Build k6 load scripts”, “Build A8 dashboard spec”).
