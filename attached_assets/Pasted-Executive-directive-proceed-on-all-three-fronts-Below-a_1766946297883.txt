Executive directive: proceed on all three fronts. Below are precise, copy‑and‑run prompts for each app/agent to execute. Each section is identity‑aware: the agent must run only its own section and begin every output with the identity line.

Global rules for all agents

Identity line (print first, exactly): APP: <app_name> | APP_BASE_URL: <base_url>
Scope discipline: Execute only your app’s section. Ignore all others.
Read-only unless explicitly instructed to change headers/content in your section.
Latency guardrail: Flag any endpoint >200ms as LATENCY RISK; >350ms as CRITICAL.
Report format: Use the MANDATORY REPORT FORMAT at the end.
A1 ONLY — scholar_auth (execute change ticket A1-CHG-2025-001)
APP: scholar_auth | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Objective

Reduce IdP contribution to fleet login latency by caching discovery and JWKS responses.
Authorized change (A1-CHG-2025-001)

Add HTTP headers on these endpoints:
/.well-known/openid-configuration
/.well-known/jwks.json
Required headers:
Cache-Control: public, max-age=300, s-maxage=300
ETag: strong (or Last-Modified if ETag infra unavailable)
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Do NOT add Vary headers that would defeat caching. Do NOT set no-store on these two endpoints.
Canary rollout: 15 minutes. If A8 probes detect p95 >150ms or 4xx spikes >2% on either endpoint, rollback immediately.
Validation steps

Before/after: record p95 latency for discovery and JWKS (A8 probe tiles).
curl checks (expect 200 and presence of headers):
curl -s -D - https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/openid-configuration -o /dev/null
curl -s -D - https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/jwks.json -o /dev/null
Success criteria (T+30m):
A1 discovery p95 ≤150ms
A1 JWKS p95 ≤150ms
No increase in 4xx on /oidc/auth
A5 ONLY — student_pilot (Code Red: investigate and fix /api/login p95=1235ms)
APP: student_pilot | APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Objective

Reduce /api/login p95 from 1235ms to ≤200ms within 24 hours.
Phase 1: trace and isolate (no code changes yet)

Collect 50 samples with timestamps:
curl -s -w "dns:%{time_namelookup} tls:%{time_connect} ttfb:%{time_starttransfer} total:%{time_total}\n" -o /dev/null https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/login
Log split:
Instrument timing around:
PKCE generation (start → end)
Session creation/signing (start → end)
Remote call to A1 discovery/JWKS (should be none at login; if any, note it)
Redirect response write
Report the median and p95 for dns/tls/ttfb/total.
Phase 2: rapid mitigations (apply in order; stop when target met)

Reuse OIDC metadata/JWKS client in-memory singletons; forbid on-demand discovery in /api/login path.
Enable HTTP keep-alive on outbound agent (if any); ensure Node/HTTP agent is reused.
Prewarm on deploy: call /api/login internally 3 times to mitigate cold starts.
Optimize session signing:
Use a single HMAC key in memory; avoid per-request key loads
Ensure cookie serialization is not awaiting I/O
Ensure /api/login handler avoids DB reads/writes; it should compute PKCE and redirect only.
Validation

Re-run 50-sample curl. Target:
total p95 ≤200ms
ttfb p95 ≤120ms
A8 probe tile for A5 /api/login returns to green.
A3 ONLY — scholarship_agent (add missing B2B CTA; keep strict scope)
APP: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Objective

Close the B2B loop by adding a Provider CTA that routes to A6 with UTM attribution; ensure no local login endpoints are introduced and telemetry is compliant.
Implementation requirements

UI placement: Global footer and/or top nav menu.
Provider CTA target:
https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/?utm_source=scholarship_agent&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=provider_acquisition
Student CTA target (confirm existing):
https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/?utm_source=scholarship_agent&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=student_acquisition
Telemetry (non-PII):
On click, emit marketing_intent event with fields: {app_id:"A3", app_name:"scholarship_agent", app_base_url:"https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app", action:"cta_click", audience:"provider"|"student", href, utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, timestamp}
Do not attach tokens or emails.
Validation

GET /api/health → 200 (<200ms)
Confirm /login, /auth/login, /api/auth/login remain 404/SPA shell (no local auth).
Static scan: Ensure exactly one or more A6 CTA hrefs present, and existing A5 CTA remains intact.
Fire two test clicks (programmatic or simulated), confirm telemetry accepted (200/202).
A8 ONLY — auto_com_center (monitoring updates)
APP: auto_com_center | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Objective

Guardrail and visibility during A1 and A5 changes.
Actions

Alerts:
A1 discovery p95 >150ms for 2 consecutive windows → warning; >200ms → critical
A5 /api/login p95 >200ms for 2 windows → warning; >350ms → critical
Dashboards:
Add tiles for A5 dns/tls/ttfb/total medians and p95 (from A5-emitted timing logs)
Evidence capture:
Record first green window after A5 drops under 200ms.
MANDATORY REPORT FORMAT (all agents)

Always start with your identity line.
APP: <app_name> | APP_BASE_URL: <base_url>
STATUS: [PLANNED | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | BLOCKER]
TIMEFRAME: [UTC start → UTC end]

ACTIONS TAKEN
[bulleted steps with endpoints, files changed (if any), and timing numbers]
2. FINDINGS

[key facts, pass/fail on each check, including PKCE, cookies, headers, CTA presence]
3. LATENCY

[endpoint, measured p95/median, thresholds, risk flag]
4. REVENUE BLOCKERS

[list any blockers; “None” if clear]
5. NEXT STEP (24–48 HOURS)

[one-line owner + action + target metric]
Decision and owner assignments

A1-CHG-2025-001: APPROVED. Owner: A1 agent. Canary 15m, full 45m. Target p95 ≤150ms on discovery/JWKS.
A5 latency investigation: CODE RED. Owner: A5 agent. Deliver root cause and p95 ≤200ms within 24h.
A3 provider CTA: APPROVED. Owner: A3 agent. Add CTA + telemetry, no auth surfaces added. Deliver within 8h.
If you want me to prioritize one deliverable first: I recommend starting with A5 latency trace now (highest revenue impact), while A1 and A3 changes proceed in parallel under the canary and UI-only risk profile.
