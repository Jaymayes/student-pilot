CEO Integration Readiness and Go/No‑Go Decision (War‑Room) – As of 2025‑11‑06 04:30 UTC

Prime Directive alignment: We proceed with an evidence-first, low-CAC, SEO-led launch path. Production remains locked until all global release gates are evidenced. Staging chain is authorized to execute immediately. Key risk is infra secrets/A2P timing; mitigation paths approved.

Critical Security Action (MANDATORY, 60‑minute SLA)
Immediate secret rotation required. M2M client secrets were surfaced in plaintext in a non-vault context. Rotate all listed client secrets and redistribute only via secrets manager. Purge any logs, CI artifacts, and chat histories containing the exposed values. Report completion with evidence links.

Global Release Gates (must pass before any production ramp)

auth: 24h soak, 0 invalid_client, refresh + revocation verified
api: P95 reads/writes ≤120ms and ACID consistency; Swagger public to ecosystem
auto_com_center: unsubscribe SLA <5s under load; DLQ=0; DNS SPF/DKIM/DMARC green; A2P brand/campaign approved
cross‑app tracing: request_id propagates across all 8 apps with trace links
Responsible AI: no academic dishonesty enablement; PII redaction; fairness telemetry baseline (scholarship_sage)
CEO Decisions and Execution Orders

Go for staging chain execution now: provider_register → scholarship_api → auto_page_maker (+2 pages) with evidence. Production stays locked.
Approve email‑only fallback for auto_com_center if A2P lags; SMS disabled until approvals complete.
Approve budget to expedite A2P brand/campaign approval and Postmark plan tier sufficient for staging + initial ramp.
Set auto‑escalation at T+10 secrets deadline (Nov 6, 16:00 UTC). If any secret is late, auto_com_center runs email‑only staging validation; SMS remains locked.
Compliance: Maintain CAN‑SPAM/TCPA/FERPA/COPPA logging and unsubscribe evidence in all environments.

Today’s Critical Path Timeline (UTC)

Now: Execute Order B (provider_register) → target evidence within 20 minutes.
+20 min after Order B: Execute scholarship_api Order 4 → evidence within 20 minutes.
<60 seconds after Order 4: auto_page_maker generates +2 pages → evidence within 10 minutes.
Nov 6, 16:00: Infra secrets delivery deadline for auto_com_center. If missed, auto‑escalate; proceed with email‑only staging validation once Postmark is available.
Nov 6, 21:00: auto_com_center staging validation evidence bundle due (unsubscribe <5s; DLQ=0; P95 ≤120ms).
+24h auth soak begins on first provider_register auth success; report by +24h with SLO and token lifecycle evidence.
Nov 8, 18:00: Production IdP deployment deadline (Keycloak/Auth0).
Nov 9: Earliest production 1% ramp consideration (subject to all gates).
Nov 12: ARR ignition target window.
KPIs to report with each evidence bundle

Platform SLOs: P95 latency, error rate, uptime; request_id trace links cross‑app.
Messaging: unsubscribe SLA, deliverability rate, DLQ depth, A2P status.
Growth: +pages indexed (auto_page_maker), provider onboarding time, first listings, B2C signups from SEO pages.
Security/Compliance: secret rotation confirmation, token lifecycle, audit logs, PII redaction, fairness telemetry (scholarship_sage).
Risks and Mitigations

Secrets exposure: Rotate immediately; confirm via evidence. Mitigation: mandatory vault distribution policy, log purges.
A2P delay: Email‑only fallback approved; no SMS until approvals.
DNS auth (SPF/DKIM/DMARC): Track to green; block production sends until confirmed.
Cross‑app tracing fragility: Enforce request_id propagation in middleware tests; include in every evidence.
CEO Close

Staging chain is GO. Production remains LOCKED pending gates and CEO authorization for 1% ramp.
Evidence-first culture remains non-negotiable: ship proofs, not assertions.
Maintain urgency and discipline. Our path to $10M profitable ARR hinges on compounding the SEO flywheel, low‑CAC growth, and secure, reliable operations.
