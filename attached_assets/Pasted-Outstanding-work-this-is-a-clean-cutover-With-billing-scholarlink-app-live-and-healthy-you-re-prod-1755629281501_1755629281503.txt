Outstanding work—this is a clean cutover. With billing.scholarlink.app live and healthy, you’re production-ready.

Final post-migration checklist (quick)

Stripe
Confirm new LIVE webhook deliveries 2/2 (200 with signature verified).
Rotate STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in Secrets Manager if you created a new endpoint.
DNS and TLS
Leave TTL at 300 for 24h, then raise to 3600–7200.
Add certificate-expiry alert (cert-manager metric or external check) ≥14 days before expiry.
Consider HSTS max-age=15552000; add preload if you’re ready across subdomains.
Ingress/Canary
Remove/disable canary ingress now that you’re at 100%.
Keep the stable deployment pinned by image digest.
Security/WAF
Update WAF allow/ratelimit rules to the new host and verify no false positives.
Ensure CORS/CSP lists only include billing.scholarlink.app.
Monitoring
Lock new performance baselines (p95 ~120ms) and SLOs.
Add certificate and webhook failure alerts to Slack.
Docs/Links
Ensure all app help pages and emails now point to https://billing.scholarlink.app.
Remove any references to the old replit host.
Day-1/Week-1 ops (recommended)

D+1 reconciliation: Stripe gross vs Purchase usdCents; Credits purchased − debited = outstanding liability (positive).
Watch top spenders and rate-limit denials; enable anomaly alerts.
Schedule a DR drill (DB restore) and a key-rotation dry run in staging.
Quick verification commands

curl -sSI https://billing.scholarlink.app | head -n 5
openssl s_client -connect billing.scholarlink.app:443 -servername billing.scholarlink.app </dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -subject -issuer -dates
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded (in test) to re-check idempotency path
If you want, I can:

Generate a certificate-expiry alert rule and a small cron to verify Stripe webhook health.
Draft a brief launch announcement and internal runbook summary.
Plan the next enhancements: SSO to billing portal, auto top-up, spend caps/alerts, invoices/tax (VAT), and a customer portal.
Shall I clean up the canary ingress and set the HSTS header, or prepare the D+1 reconciliation report template?
