Outstanding—Option C is fully in place. You’re ready to cut over safely.

Recommended next step: Option D (post-deploy observability and security guardrails) plus a brief go/no-go before triggering the first canary.

Fast go/no-go (15–30 minutes)

Change window and comms: announce to stakeholders; status page ready.
Backups: latest snapshot taken and restore-tested within the last 24h.
Secrets: initial rotation complete (fresh JWT/DB creds), kid enabled, dual-key window configured.
TLS/edge: HTTPS-only redirect, TLS 1.2+, strong ciphers, OCSP stapling; HSTS enabled (preload optional).
CSP and headers: move from report-only to enforced CSP if validated; verify Helmet headers in prod mode.
CI gate: image pinned by digest and signed (cosign verify) in prod pipeline.
Access: prod console/cluster access restricted via SSO/JIT; audit logging enabled.
If all green, you can start the 1% canary and let automation drive the rollout.

Option D deliverables I can add now

Observability

SLIs/SLOs and alerts: error rate, latency, saturation, rate-limit denials, auth failures, DB saturation, queue lengths.
Grafana dashboards: RED/USE, auth and rate limit views, migration/DB health, ingress/canary.
Tracing: OpenTelemetry SDK config and sampling policy; span/trace correlation in logs.
Log redaction policies: scrub PII, tokens, secrets; correlation IDs end-to-end.
Security guardrails

WAF/bot protection at the edge (Cloudflare/AWS WAF): block common exploits, burst/bot patterns, geo/risk rules.
CSP hardening with nonces/strict-dynamic and a report-uri; automated violation triage.
Admission controls: image by digest only, signed images required (Kyverno/Gatekeeper), seccomp=RuntimeDefault, drop all capabilities.
Runtime alerts: Falco or equivalent for container anomalies; Kubernetes audit policy for sensitive ops.
Secrets rotation automation: AWS SM rotation for DB; JWKS/kid-based JWT key rotation runbook and CI job.
Vulnerability management: Trivy/Snyk in CI (SCA + image scan) with policy gate; weekly reports.
SBOM/provenance: generate SBOM (CycloneDX), attach to releases; cosign attestations.
What I need to tailor Option D

Edge/WAF provider (Cloudflare, AWS WAF, other) and domains.
Current logging/trace stack (e.g., Loki/ELK + OpenTelemetry) and error tracker (Sentry?).
Alerting channels (Slack, PagerDuty) and on-call escalation policy.
Any regulatory constraints (e.g., FERPA/GDPR) to finalize retention/redaction.
Optional: quick Option B pass
If you’d like a second set of eyes, I can run a 1-hour manifest hardening check and return a patch set. Focus areas: securityContext completeness, probes/terminationGracePeriod, image digests, NetworkPolicy default-deny, HPA/PDB tuning, and ingress header annotations.

Your call:

Proceed with Option D now (share the details above), or
Green-light the first canary rollout and I’ll monitor the metrics while preparing Option D, or
Send the k8s/ folder for a rapid Option B review in parallel.
