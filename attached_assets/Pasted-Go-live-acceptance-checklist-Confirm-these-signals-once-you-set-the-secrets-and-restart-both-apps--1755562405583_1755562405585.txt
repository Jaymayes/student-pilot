Go-live acceptance checklist
Confirm these signals once you set the secrets and restart both apps:

Agent capabilities: /agent/capabilities returns your 9 actions with health.ok=true
Auto-registration: startup logs show successful POSTs to /orchestrator/register and /orchestrator/heartbeat
Command Center registry: /orchestrator/agents shows your agent online with the 9 capabilities
Secure dispatch: /orchestrator/tasks/dispatch -> agent /agent/task with valid JWT; agent responds 202 and posts callbacks to /orchestrator/tasks/:task_id/callback
Events emitted: /orchestrator/events shows task lifecycle and domain events with the same trace_id
Rate limiting: 5/min enforced on /agent/task (happy path unaffected; 401s won’t count unless limiter is placed before auth)
Validation: missing/invalid payloads result in structured errors (code/message/details)
Graceful disable: without SHARED_SECRET or COMMAND_CENTER_URL, agent routes remain disabled (already observed)
Secrets to set (Agent + Command Center)

Agent (ScholarLink):
SHARED_SECRET: long random string (must match CC)
COMMAND_CENTER_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
AGENT_NAME: scholarlink (or your chosen name)
AGENT_ID: scholarlink-agent (or your chosen id)
AGENT_BASE_URL: your public URL
Command Center:
SHARED_SECRET: same value
AGENTS_ALLOWLIST: the agent’s base URL
JWT_ISSUER=auto-com-center, JWT_AUDIENCE=scholar-sync-agents
Quick verification (after restart)

Agent online: GET {CC}/orchestrator/agents
Capabilities: GET {AGENT}/agent/capabilities
Dispatch a task (example): POST {CC}/orchestrator/tasks/dispatch { "action": "scholarlink.search", "payload": { "query": "STEM", "filters": { "level": "undergrad" }, "pagination": { "page": 1, "size": 5 } }, "requested_by": "ops", "resources": { "timeout_ms": 20000, "retry": 1 } } Then GET {CC}/orchestrator/tasks/{task_id} until status=succeeded; check /orchestrator/events for matching trace_id.
Recommended next steps

Onboard additional agents (Student Pilot, Provider Register, Scholarship API) using the same bridge pattern.
Add a simple composite flow in CC (search -> match -> generate_page) to prove cross-agent orchestration.
Observability: capture metrics for tasks accepted/succeeded/failed, p95 latency, JWT failures, rate-limited requests, heartbeats missed.
Hardening (optional): idempotency keys (jti) to dedupe tasks, dead-letter queue on repeated failures, circuit breaker around AI-heavy actions, secret rotation with dual-secret validation, event schema versioning (v1).
If you want, I can generate:

A Postman collection pre-filled for your 9 ScholarLink actions
A one-command bash smoke test that dispatches 2–3 tasks and asserts callbacks/events
A minimal dashboard page in the Command Center to visualize your agent’s tasks and events in real time
Tell me the exact action names you’re advertising (or share /agent/capabilities output), and I’ll tailor the test kit to your agent’s API.
