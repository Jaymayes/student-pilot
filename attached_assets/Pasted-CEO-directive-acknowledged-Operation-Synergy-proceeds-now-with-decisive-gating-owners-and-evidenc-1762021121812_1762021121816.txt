CEO directive acknowledged. Operation Synergy proceeds now with decisive gating, owners, and evidence requirements to reach Full Operational Capability.

Immediate unblock for Gate 1 (scholar_auth)

Owner: Human Ops (Auth DRI, temporary)
Action (now): Open the scholar_auth Replit workspace and click Republish/Redeploy
Post to war room once live:
ISSUER_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
JWKS_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/jwks.json
/login reachable (expected 200 for GET or 400/401 on invalid POST with standardized JSON error)
SLA: 10 minutes to “Gate 1 GREEN” declaration
Gating plan and success criteria

Gate 1: scholar_auth
Must-have: JWKS live, token issuance, RBAC claims in JWT (Student, Provider, Admin, SystemService), CORS restricted to student_pilot and provider_register, rate limiting on, strong password hashing
Gate 2: scholarship_api (starts only after Gate 1 GREEN)
Must-have: JWT validation against scholar_auth, RBAC enforced with correct 200/401/403 matrix, input validation/sanitization, verified data ingress from provider_register and scholarship_agent, verified data egress to student_pilot, scholarship_sage, auto_page_maker; P95 ≤120ms on core reads; 5xx <0.5%
Gate 3: student_pilot + scholarship_sage E2E (starts after Gate 2 GREEN)
Must-have: end-to-end authenticated sign-in, profile, search, recommendations, apply, status tracking; scholarship_sage recommendations endpoint integrated; WCAG checks pass; P95 ≤120ms; no CORS/auth errors
Parallel readiness: scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker, auto_com_center complete Section 4 verifications and stand by to push evidence the moment their upstream dependencies go GREEN
Assignments (DRIs)

scholar_auth: Human Ops (temporary), then hand back to Auth DRI
scholarship_api: API DRI (Agent3 in scholarship_api workspace)
scholarship_sage: Sage DRI (Agent3)
student_pilot: Frontend DRI (Agent3)
provider_register: Provider DRI (Agent3)
scholarship_agent: Automation DRI (Agent3)
auto_page_maker: SEO DRI (Agent3)
auto_com_center: Comms DRI (Agent3)
What each DRI must deliver (evidence bundle)

Canary JSON (version, dependencies_ok)
Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
Auth/RBAC proof: sample JWT payload (redacted), 200/401/403 matrix
Latency: ≥30 request samples with P50/P95, error rates
Integration checks: upstream/downstream call logs or curl outputs
For auto_page_maker: live page URLs with SEO meta and schema markup
For auto_com_center: event receipt logs, template render samples, queue depth under load, unsubscribe/opt-out proof
Lifecycle and revenue cessation guidance (include in Section 7)

Infrastructure (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center): expected lifecycle 5–7 years; plan major upgrade/replacement by Q4 2031 unless security or protocol shifts accelerate
User-facing (student_pilot, provider_register): expected lifecycle 3–4 years; plan major UX overhaul by Q2 2029
Intelligence/Automation (scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker): expected lifecycle 2–3 years; plan model/logic refresh by Q3 2027
Contingencies: rapid protocol changes (beyond OAuth 2.0/OIDC), browser privacy shifts impacting cookies/CSP, AI model breakthroughs, search algorithm updates affecting SEO, regulatory changes (FERPA/COPPA/GDPR)
Critical constraints and decisions

Agents cannot click “Publish” in other Replit workspaces. Human Ops must execute Gate 1 republish for scholar_auth now. No further deploys without Gate 1 GREEN evidence.
CAC discipline: prioritize Auto Page Maker SEO once Gate 2 is GREEN; baseline target is first 1,000 indexed scholarship pages within 30 days.
Profit integrity: verify 3% provider fee accrual in provider_register and ledger logging in scholarship_api before lifting B2B traffic cap.
SLO adherence: enforce 99.9% uptime and ~120ms P95 latency. Any service breaching P95 must file a remediation plan with a 72-hour SLA.
Deadlines (relative to Gate 1 GREEN)

T+0: Gate 1 GREEN evidence posted by Human Ops
T+15: Gate 2 GREEN evidence bundle posted by API DRI
T+30: Gate 3 E2E smoke completed and evidence posted by Frontend + Sage DRIs
T+60: All Agent3 instances submit Section 7 reports (see template below)

Immediate next step (blocking item)

Human Ops: Reply “EPD-Auth-01 executing now,” republish scholar_auth, then post ISSUER_URL and JWKS_URL with /login reachability. That flips Gate 1 to GREEN and unlocks the cascade to Gates 2 and 3.
I will not authorize Gate 2 deployment until Gate 1 GREEN evidence is posted. Once Gate 1 is GREEN, DRIs execute and submit their Section 7 reports within the stated SLAs.
