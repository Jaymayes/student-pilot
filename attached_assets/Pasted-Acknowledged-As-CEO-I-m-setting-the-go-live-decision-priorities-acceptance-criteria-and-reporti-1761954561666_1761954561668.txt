Acknowledged. As CEO, I’m setting the go-live decision, priorities, acceptance criteria, and reporting cadence for Operation Synergy.

Decision

Execute Option A with a focused twist: Fix the critical path immediately and launch with manual fallbacks for communications while non-blocking items finish in parallel. This aligns with our data-first growth plan and near-term revenue priorities (B2B emphasis and rapid activation of high-intent users), while preserving long-term platform integrity and trust. The playbook’s user-behavior insights and revenue plan favor getting the core flows live and monetizing quickly, then iterating fast on automation and quality of matches and messaging .
Critical Path (timeboxed)
Target first revenue today. Start timers upon receipt of this directive.

scholar_auth — P0 fixes (T+0 → T+2-3h)
Fix JWKS endpoint; implement /canary v2.7 returning the 8 required fields.
Acceptance: external services validate JWTs; /canary: app, app_base_url, version=v2.7, status, p95_ms, security_headers (present/missing), dependencies_ok, timestamp; P95 ≤ 120ms; 6/6 security headers; RBAC enforced (Student, Provider, Admin, SystemService).
Owner: Auth Team lead.
Why now: Single source of identity; blocks everything else.
2. scholarship_api — P0 fixes (parallel, T+0 → T+2-3h)

Implement /canary v2.7; harden authorization middleware to validate tokens against scholar_auth and enforce RBAC; verify provider_register and scholarship_agent writes; verify read flows to student_pilot, scholarship_sage, auto_page_maker.
Acceptance: 401/403 on unauthorized; standardized error object; P95 ≤ 120ms; 6/6 security headers; integration tests green.
Owner: API Team lead.
Why now: Source of truth; blocks data path and both B2C/B2B funnels.
3. provider_register — compliance gate (T+0.5 → T+1h)

Verify “3% platform fee” disclosure is visible; fix copy if missing.
Owner: B2B PM + Web lead.
Why now: Compliance and trust; unblocks partner signups and fees.
4. student_pilot — e2e smoke (after 1 & 2, T+2h → T+3h)

Validate full auth journey, search via scholarship_api, recommendations via scholarship_sage, application submission, and status retrieval.
Owners: Frontend lead + QA.
Why now: First revenue; confirms end-to-end path for students.
Parallel but Non-Blocking for Launch

auto_com_center: Fix /canary identity/version/fields; implement /send endpoint. Launch with manual email fallback (limit: first 10–20 customers). This de-risks day-1 communications while we finish automation. Use resilient patterns (retry with backoff, circuit breakers, queues) for the production version per our autonomy blueprint .
scholarship_agent: Validate M2M auth, retries, circuit breaker; event payloads to auto_com_center (queue-backed). These resilience patterns are part of our operating model for autonomous services .
auto_page_maker: Validate trigger on scholarship create/update; schema markup and SEO metadata. This supports our low-CAC acquisition engine and aligns with the playbook’s organic growth mandate and B2B focus for ARR scale .
scholarship_sage: Already reported GREEN per your note; maintain P95 ≤ 120ms and ensure recommendations endpoint is consumable by student_pilot. Medium-term, integrate essay-NLP signals to improve “implicit fit” quality for differentiated student value and conversion lift, as outlined in the playbook .
Executive Acceptance Gates (must pass before flipping revenue on)

Canary compliance: All critical-path apps return v2.7 8-field JSON and P95 ≤ 120ms; 6/6 security headers present; dependencies_ok = true on scholar_auth and scholarship_api.
Auth/API e2e: Valid JWT issuance + RBAC; scholarship_api enforced 401/403 for unauthorized; standardized JSON error schema across services. These are core to our trust, scale, and resilience model for autonomous systems .
Compliance: Provider fee disclosure visible; opt-out/unsubscribe verified in auto_com_center (manual fallback acceptable day-1; automation to follow within 24–48 hours).
Student pilot path: New user → login → upload one document → see recommendations → submit first application. The playbook is clear that “first document upload” is the activation moment we must optimize around from day-1 .
Operating Instructions to Agent3 (All Instances)

Execute only your app’s “FOR:” section. Do not cross-patch other apps.
Submit the mandatory report in the exact format provided in Section 7 of the directive once your tasks are complete.
For pre-launch today: 5-sample latency runs are acceptable; produce 30-sample latency reports within 24 hours post-launch.
Include the Lifecycle and Revenue Cessation Analysis in your report using these guidance windows:
Infrastructure (Auth, API, Com Center): 5–7 years baseline; reassess if standards shift beyond OAuth 2.x/JWT or scale needs (100x events/day) exceed current architecture.
User-facing (Student Pilot, Provider Register): 3–4 years; earlier if design trends or accessibility standards move materially.
Intelligence/Automation (Sage, Agent, Page Maker): 2–3 years; earlier with major AI/ML leaps or new automation platforms.
This is consistent with our autonomy roadmap and the shift to AgentOps—expect faster iteration cycles on intelligent agents and governance of emergent behavior .
KPI Guardrails for Today’s Launch

B2C funnel: Track activation rate to “first document upload,” matched scholarship CTR, and credit ARPU; the playbook ties activation and revenue to this north-star action .
B2B funnel: Track net-new provider signups, listings live, and fee capture at 3%; roadmap emphasizes B2B revenue scale and partner value realization .
Reliability: P95 latency and error rate per critical endpoint; alerting on auth failures and API 5xx spikes. Use backoff/circuit breakers across agents and comms to preserve stability under load .
Risk, Ethics, and Compliance

Maintain Responsible AI: bias checks for recommendations; transparent logic in eligibility vs. ranking; no academic dishonesty tooling. Our governance approach emphasizes transparency and explainability as systems grow more autonomous .
Data protection: enforce HTTPS/TLS end-to-end; strict CORS; role-scoped access; standardized error responses; unsubscribe compliance.
Timeline and Ownership

T+0: Auth and API teams start P0 fixes in parallel; B2B PM verifies provider fee copy; QA preps e2e scripts.
T+2–3h: Auth/API pass canary and e2e gates; student_pilot smoke completes.
T+3–4h: Flip revenue on; manual comms fallback active; non-blocking fixes continue.
T+24h: 30-sample latency reports submitted; auto_com_center /send automated; finalize any v2.7 canary gaps across non-critical apps.
Deliverables

Each Agent3 instance: Submit the Section 7 report for your app using the mandatory format immediately upon completion.
Engineering leads: Confirm “green” on acceptance gates above and post a one-line GO/NO-GO in the release channel.
Post-launch: Provide a 24-hour stability report with KPIs and customer-impact notes.
Confirm back “UNDERSTOOD” and begin execution. If any P0 requires escalation or a go/no-go trade-off, page me immediately with the specific blocker, ETA, and revenue impact.

This plan gets us to first revenue in hours, aligned with our playbook’s data-driven growth levers, while protecting long-term platform quality and trust through autonomous, resilient patterns and disciplined governance   .
