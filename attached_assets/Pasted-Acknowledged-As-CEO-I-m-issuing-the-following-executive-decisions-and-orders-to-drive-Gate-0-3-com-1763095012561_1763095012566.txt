Acknowledged. As CEO, I’m issuing the following executive decisions and orders to drive Gate 0–3 completion and protect ARR ignition.

Executive Decisions (effective immediately)

Access and Authority
Ops: Grant Agent3 read/write access to all eight workspaces within 15 minutes of this notice. If not completed, Agent3 is authorized to take direct control of P0 repos after a 2-hour block.
DRIs: Security Lead (scholar_auth), API Lead (scholarship_api), Messaging Lead (auto_com_center), Frontend Lead (student_pilot, provider_register), Data/ML Lead (scholarship_sage).
Budget Approvals
k6 Cloud canary: Approved up to $1,500 for 72 hours of testing.
Reserved VM/Autoscale (auth, api): Approved immediately.
Email/SMS provider scale-up credits (SendGrid/Twilio): Approved up to $2,500 for first 30 days.
Product Scope Decisions
student_pilot offline mode: Defer to post-launch (Phase 1.1). Provide a read-only “queue and sync” fallback for spotty connectivity; no hard offline cache at launch.
RBAC minimum viable scope at launch: student, provider_admin, reviewer, super_admin. Expand granular scopes post-launch.
Go/No-Go Guardrails
SLA: 99.9% availability, P95 ≤120ms core paths (auth, api); scholarship_sage ≤150ms P95 at 100 RPS.
Security: MFA enforced for privileged roles; CORS explicit allowlist only; 8/8 M2M clients issuing tokens; audit logging on all state changes.
Canary gates: auto_com_center must achieve P95 ≤250ms and ≤0.5% errors at 250 RPS for 30 minutes from external worker.
Re-baselined Gate Timeline and Acceptance Criteria

Gate 0 (Nov 15, 12:00 PM MST): scholar_auth + scholarship_api
scholar_auth
8/8 M2M token issuance validated with signed JWTs (roles/scopes embedded).
RBAC claims present and verified for student, provider_admin, reviewer, super_admin.
CORS: explicit allowlist for all eight apps; no wildcards.
MFA: enforced for provider_admin, reviewer, super_admin; evidence of successful/failed MFA flows.
HA: Reserved VM/Autoscale configured; health checks green.
scholarship_api
JWT validator stable under 300 RPS, 10 min; error rate ≤0.5%.
/health and /readyz include DB and JWKS dependency checks.
Structured error responses; backoff/retry for auth dependency timeouts.
Gate 1 (Nov 16–17): scholarship_api + auto_com_center reliability
auto_com_center
Templates refactored to env-based URLs; zero hardcoded links.
Canary: 30 min at 250 RPS, external runner; P95 ≤250ms; ≤0.5% errors.
Delivery monitoring: bounces/drops alerts; provider API keys verified in secrets vault.
scholarship_api
Event hooks to trigger auto_com_center on status changes; idempotent and audited.
Gate 2 (Nov 17–18): Frontends + scholarship_sage E2E
student_pilot, provider_register
Zero hardcoded URLs; env-driven config only.
Graceful error states implemented; full Student Journey and Provider Journey E2E pass.
scholarship_sage
S2S auth with real data; Precision@10 ≥85% on production-like fixture; P95 ≤150ms at 100 RPS.
Gate 3 (Nov 18–19): Security review + staged ramp
Pen-test/abuse tests complete; secrets rotation done; incident runbooks in place.
Ramp plan: 5% → 20% → 50% → 100% traffic, with automated rollback.
Orders to Resolve Current Blockers (ownership and due times)

scholar_auth (Security Lead; Agent3 if access not granted in 2 hrs)
Finish M2M database-backed client seeding; confirm “Client” model via DB adapter.
Produce token proofs for 8/8 clients with redacted samples and claims screenshots.
Lockdown CORS; enforce MFA for privileged roles; upload HA config.
Due: Nov 15, 10:30 AM MST (buffer before Gate 0).
scholarship_api (API Lead; Agent3 to run tests)
Patch JWKS caching and retry; ensure signature validation under load is stable.
Implement event hooks to auto_com_center; extend /health to show auth/DB.
Run 300 RPS/10-min test; provide latency/error charts.
Due: Nov 15, 10:30 AM MST.
auto_com_center (Messaging Lead)
Refactor templates to env URLs; configure bounce/drop monitoring; secrets audit.
Prepare k6 canary scripts (Agent3 provided); run 30-minute external canary.
Due: Nov 16, 10:00 AM MST (start canary window).
student_pilot, provider_register (Frontend Lead)
Complete env refactor, error states, and E2E flows; accessibility checklist.
Due: Nov 18, 12:00 PM MST.
scholarship_sage (Data/ML Lead)
Validate real-data relevance ≥85% top-10; keep P95 ≤150ms at 100 RPS.
Due: Nov 18, 12:00 PM MST.
Evidence Package Requirements

Every app must submit evidence with this header:
APPLICATION NAME: [App]
APP_BASE_URL: [URL]
Contents per gate:
Test artifacts: scripts, logs, charts; redacted tokens; screenshots.
Config diffs: CORS, MFA, env schema, autoscale.
Monitoring: dashboards links, alert rules.
Security: audit log samples for state changes; secrets inventory (redacted).
Delivery cadence:
Gate 0 Checkpoint 1: Nov 15, 12:15 PM MST
Gate 0 Final: Nov 15, 5:00 PM MST
Daily 9:00 AM MST stand-up summaries through Nov 20
Risk Management and Contingencies

If M2M seeding lags: temporary static client allowlist for 8 service IDs with short-lived secrets and forced rotation every 24 hours. Decommission once DB adapter verified.
If auto_com_center P95 fails in cloud canary: scale workers + queue backpressure; fall back to rate-limited batches at 150 RPS with SLA ≥99% delivery in 5 minutes; re-run canary post-scale-up.
If scholarship_sage relevance <85% with real data by Nov 18: lower rec set to top-5 with diversity filter; display confidence badges; ship with “improving” label and roll daily model updates.
KPI Alignment and ARR Plan

B2C funnel
Target conversion free→paid: 3.0% at launch, ARPU $7.50/mo via credits.
Auto Page Maker: ramp to 3k indexed pages in 14 days; SEO traffic ≥8k sessions/mo.
B2B provider fees
40 active providers by end of Q1; 3% fee live; first payments integrated by Dec 15.
CAC
80% organic acquisition via Auto Page Maker; paid channels capped at 20% of weekly new users.
Profitability
Maintain 4x AI service markup and 3% provider fee to cover ops + margin; monitor compute/utilization daily.
Immediate Next Steps for Agent3 (confirming your plan, plus CEO directives)

Proceed with the hybrid approach:
Continue provider_register and student_pilot Gate 2 error states/E2E immediately.
Upon access grant (Ops now executing): switch to Gate 0 P0 items on scholar_auth and scholarship_api.
Prepare and run auto_com_center canary via external runner once Messaging Lead signals ready.
Upload Gate 0 runbooks and evidence bundles to each repo.
Send a checkpoint email at Nov 15, 12:15 PM MST with pass/fail per acceptance criteria and links to artifacts.
I will personally review Gate 0 evidence at 5:00 PM MST on Nov 15. If P0 items are not green by then, I will reallocate ownership and budget in real time to hit Nov 20 ARR ignition. Stay on the hybrid track, execute with urgency, and escalate any blocker exceeding 30 minutes.
