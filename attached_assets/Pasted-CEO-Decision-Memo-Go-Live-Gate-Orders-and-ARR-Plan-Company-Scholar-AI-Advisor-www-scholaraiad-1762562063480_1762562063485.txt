CEO Decision Memo — Go-Live Gate, Orders, and ARR Plan
Company: Scholar AI Advisor (www.scholaraiadvisor.com)
Date/Time: 2025-11-07 ~23:35 UTC

Executive Summary

Authorization Gate: Conditional GO approved. Final AUTH GREEN TAG will be issued in the 00:00–00:15 UTC window contingent on fresh snapshots meeting SLOs (P95 ≤120ms; error rate ≤0.1%). Quality over speed remains non-negotiable.
Current Signal: Latest snapshots indicate readiness. Configuration locked for scholar_auth (no persistent DB connections). Cloudflare worker staged, disabled until Nov 9 A/B.
B2B Constraint: provider_register execution (ORDER_B) is BLOCKED pending Stripe production verification; escalate until confirmed. Do not proceed without confirmation.
Responsible AI: scholarship_agent fairness telemetry infrastructure is approved. Operate in observe-only mode through Nov 12; no changes to matching logic until metrics prove stable.
Non-Negotiable Reporting Format for All Agent3 Deliverables

Every report must begin with:
Application Name
APP_BASE_URL
Gate Criteria for AUTH GREEN TAG (00:00–00:15 UTC)

Required metrics at 23:40, 23:55, and 00:10 UTC:
GET /.well-known/openid-configuration: P50, P95, error_rate
GET /.well-known/jwks.json: P50, P95, error_rate
POST /token: P50, P95, error_rate
POST /authorize: P50, P95, error_rate
Pass: P95 ≤120ms for each endpoint and error rate ≤0.1%.
Fail: If any endpoint exceeds P95 120ms at 00:15 UTC, slip 24 hours with current config preserved.
Orders by Application

scholar_auth APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: Gate-ready; Conditional GO.
Orders:
Keep DB connections non-persistent (locked). Document rationale in EDR with before/after metrics.
Maintain 1-minute rolling SLI and 5-minute SLO snapshots during gate. If error_rate >0.1% for 3 consecutive minutes, auto-page to War Room and halt downstream E2E tests.
Cloudflare worker stays disabled until Nov 9 A/B. Prepare rollback plan and a 2-hour comparative test plan for TTFB/latency/cache-hit.
Retain 7 days of auth metrics and request_id logs for audit.
2. scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GREEN; ready for gate monitoring.
Orders:
During 23:40/23:55/00:10 snapshots, capture 401 and 5xx counts, and confirm continuous JWKS validation.
Deliver ORDER_4_EVIDENCE by ~01:30 UTC:
Cross-app request_id traces: student_pilot → scholar_auth → scholarship_api; scholarship_sage → scholar_auth → scholarship_api; provider_register → scholar_auth → scholarship_api (if ORDER_B runs).
P50/P95 latency for protected endpoints; error budget summary (<1%).
Confirmation of ACID consistency and token validation enforcement.
3. scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: Fairness telemetry infrastructure delivered; restart confirmed.
Orders (Responsible AI, observe-only through Nov 12):
Begin daily fairness rollups at 12:00 UTC with report published by 12:15 UTC.
Hard thresholds and alerts:
Selection parity per cohort outside 0.8–1.25 for 2 consecutive days → raise Sev-2, freeze algorithmic changes.
False Positive Rate (human-review-based) >2% in rolling 24h → Sev-2.
Rationale coverage <95% → Sev-3 and block new auto-apply actions until back >95%.
No mutation to matching logic until Nov 12 unless Sev-1 safety issue. All telemetry must remain PII-safe and append-only; exec/admin role required for endpoints.
Prepare a bias red-team test plan for week of Nov 12; include synthetic cohorts and counterfactual tests.
4. scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: READY, waiting for AUTH GREEN TAG.
Orders:
Within 30 minutes of AUTH GREEN TAG, execute 3x client_credentials grants; verify read-only scopes; produce evidence with P50/P95 latency and request_id lineage.
Confirm no write/delete capabilities accessible via M2M token; attach redacted token claim samples in evidence.
5. student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: READY, awaiting AUTH GREEN TAG.
Orders:
Execute full E2E PKCE flow immediately after AUTH GREEN TAG; deliver evidence by 00:45 UTC:
Registration/Login via scholar_auth.
Profile submission to scholarship_api.
scholarship_sage interaction.
P50/P95 latency, error rate, and cross-app request_id lineage screenshots (secrets redacted).
Validate responsive behavior across a desktop and a mobile viewport; log any P95 >120ms as a UI Sev-3 with remediation owner.
6. provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: Technically GREEN; EXECUTION BLOCKED pending Stripe production verification.
Orders:
Immediate escalation to Finance/Platform Ops until the following are confirmed in production:
Live STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (not test).
Webhook endpoint registered; STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches.
Test webhook sent and 200 OK verified; production mode enabled.
Decision point:
If Stripe production verification confirmed by 00:20 UTC and AUTH GREEN TAG issued → Execute ORDER_B within 60 minutes; deliver ORDER_B_EVIDENCE by ~01:00 UTC, including 3% platform fee capture proof.
If not confirmed by 00:20 UTC → Slip B2B by 24 hours; do not execute ORDER_B.
7. auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GREEN; FROZEN through Nov 12; monitor-only.
Orders:
Continue daily KPI rollups at 06:00 UTC (pages live, IndexNow ≥95%, CWV p75 GREEN, error rate, P95).
No changes until Nov 12 unless Sev-1 availability issue. Ensure sitemap/index feeds remain fresh.
8. auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: READY; War Room cadence active.
Orders:
Broadcast metrics snapshots at 23:40, 23:55, and 00:10 UTC to leadership channel using the required format.
On final approval, send AUTH GREEN TAG message using the approved template. Maintain deliverability health (SPF, DKIM, DMARC aligned; unsubscribe compliance).
ARR Ignition Plan and KPIs

B2C (student_pilot):
Earliest ignition: 2025-11-10 00:00 UTC.
KPIs: Free→Paid conversion rate, credit ARPU, 7-day activation rate, support ticket rate (<2% of active users).
B2B (provider_register):
Earliest ignition: ~01:30–03:00 UTC Nov 8, contingent on AUTH GREEN TAG and Stripe production verification.
KPI: Activated providers, successful charges with 3% platform fee, time-to-first-disbursement, provider NPS.
CAC and Growth:
Primary lever: Auto Page Maker SEO compounding; maintain low-CAC growth focus.
Weekly: Organic sessions, indexed pages, CTR, SERP rank for top queries; correlate with sign-up velocity.
Reliability SLOs:
Uptime ≥99.9%, P95 ≤120ms across core auth and API touchpoints; maintain error budget <1%.
Risks and Mitigations

Auth regression risk: Keep non-persistent DB connections; roll back any change that causes Token/Authorize P95 >120ms for 5 consecutive minutes during gate.
Stripe dependency: Enforced “no ORDER_B without production verification.” If missed tonight, slip B2B by 24h; keep provider pipeline warm.
Cloudflare unknowns: A/B test in controlled staging Nov 9; no change to production path before then.
Responsible AI: Fairness telemetry running with strict thresholds and incident response. No auto-apply expansion until fairness stability confirmed.
Decisions and Next Checkpoints

AUTH GREEN TAG Decision: Final at 00:00–00:15 UTC window; requires snapshots meeting SLOs.
Evidence Deadlines:
student_pilot E2E: by 00:45 UTC.
scholarship_sage M2M: by 00:45 UTC.
provider_register ORDER_B: by ~01:00 UTC (only if Stripe confirmed).
scholarship_api ORDER_4_EVIDENCE: by ~01:30 UTC.
Fairness Telemetry: First daily report 2025-11-10 12:15 UTC; alerts live immediately.
Required Acknowledgements (reply all in War Room)

Agent3: Confirm receipt of this memo and readiness to execute per-application orders and deadlines.
Finance/Platform Ops: Confirm Stripe production verification status and ETA immediately.
Auth DRI: Confirm that snapshot automation is scheduled and evidence bundle locations are set.
We will not trade reliability for speed. Hit the gate cleanly or we slip 24 hours. Maintain focus on low-CAC, SEO-led compounding growth and Responsible AI as force multipliers for ARR.
