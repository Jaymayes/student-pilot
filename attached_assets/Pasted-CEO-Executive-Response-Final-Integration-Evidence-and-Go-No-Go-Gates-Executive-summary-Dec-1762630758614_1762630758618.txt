CEO Executive Response — Final Integration, Evidence, and Go/No‑Go Gates

Executive summary

Decision: Proceed under Contingency B. Guard the gate. No compromises on issuer correctness, security, performance, or deliverability.
Provisional status: All eight applications report GREEN/frozen with clear next steps. Final acceptance for revenue-impacting paths is contingent on evidence delivery and deliverability guardrails turning GREEN before any broadcast.
ARR ignition windows remain unchanged: B2B earliest Nov 10 01:30–03:00 UTC; B2C earliest Nov 11 00:00 UTC.
Stripe hard gate (provider_register) — evidence required now

You have asserted or implied a PASS at/after 18:00 UTC. Final CEO acceptance requires the 18:05 UTC evidence package to be posted and linked from the master index.
Required evidence package (mask/redact secrets):
Proof production live key is loaded
Webhook registration with signing secret configured
Signed event 200 OK with server logs showing verified signature + request_id lineage
If policy permits: authorized-and-voided live-mode charge proof
Action: Post links in the MASTER_EVIDENCE_INDEX now and reply back with the request_id lineage for the above items.
If any element is missing or fails validation, immediately enable graceful fallback (ENABLE_WAITLIST_MODE=true), broadcast waitlist messaging via auto_com_center only after deliverability guardrails are green, and provide the first 10 anonymized request_id samples within 30 minutes.
Deliverability guardrails (auto_com_center) — must be GREEN before any broadcast

Outstanding until explicitly proven GREEN:
Email: DKIM, SPF, DMARC alignment; seed inbox tests (≥99% accepted, ≥95% inbox placement); blocklist monitoring; domain throttling readiness
SMS: Opt‑in enforcement, STOP/HELP compliance, per‑country rate limits
Action: Post the DELIVERABILITY_GUARDRAILS_CHECKLIST results and seed test artifacts to the master index. No PASS/FAIL or fallback broadcasts are allowed until these are GREEN.
Authoritative schedule and acceptance criteria

Governance, owners, and reporting cadence — required updates

18:05 UTC today: Post Stripe PASS/FAIL outcome with evidence links and request_id lineage. If already posted outside this channel, reply with the links now.

Financial and ARR guardrails

ARR ignition dates unchanged; do not pull revenue levers that compromise security, issuer correctness, or deliverability.
CAC discipline: continue prioritizing organic, SEO‑driven growth (Auto Page Maker).
Profitability guardrails: maintain 4x AI service markup and 3% provider fee coverage; no monetization pathways enabled under fallback.
Risk and escalation

Replit dependency: Ensure P1 ticket posted by 19:30 UTC; monitor status
DNS/Cloudflare: Low‑TTL, multi‑region checks; evidence in tonight’s package
Pre‑soak breach: Immediate fail broadcast (after deliverability checks), slip to next window
Stripe at risk: Escalate to CFO + Stripe Priority Support; budget up to $500 pre‑approved
What I need from you now (clear, time‑boxed)

Stripe gate: Provide the 18:05 UTC evidence package links and request_id lineage in reply.
Deliverability: Provide DKIM/SPF/DMARC proof and seed inbox results; confirm SMS STOP/HELP logs. No broadcasts permitted until you show GREEN.
19:30 UTC: Provide Replit P1 + Cloudflare evidence links on time.
CEO decision

Proceed as planned under Contingency B.
Final integration is conditionally accepted pending evidence delivery as specified above.
Guard the gate. If any variance from the schedule or acceptance criteria arises, report immediately with request_id references, remediation, and ETA.
