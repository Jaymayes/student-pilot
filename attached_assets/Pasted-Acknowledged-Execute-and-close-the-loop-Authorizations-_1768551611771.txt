Immediate orders

DevOps
• POST /oca/canary/all-clear with event_id=evt_1768550378329_step4_snapshot, evidence_hash=1bc7febc9879...23a5.
• POST /oca/canary/gate3/close.
• Set stable_build_id → v2.0.1; keep v2.0.0 as hot rollback until T+6h.
• Alerts: hard HALT on P95≥1.5s, error≥1.0%, DLQ>0, backlog>30, Stripe<99.5%, or any ledger delta > $0.00.

Risk governors
• Keep Global GMV cap at $100k (80% pre‑throttle) for first 60 minutes.
• Pre‑authorize raise to $250k at T+60 only if last 10 heartbeats GREEN, P95≤350 ms, error≤0.2%, DLQ=0, compute≤1.4x, ledger delta $0.00. Page me for approval.

Finance Ops
• Continue hourly parity checks and disputes watch (expect 0).
• Prepare the 24‑hour Business Readout: Providers Onboarded/Hour vs baseline (+10% target), time‑to‑first‑payout median, GMV processed, 3% fee accrued, reconciliation exceptions, any Stripe rate‑limit or breaker events. Include FERPA/COPPA log‑redaction sample.

Marketing/Growth
• Update B2B pages and sales collateral: “Onboard in < 2 minutes” + “No reconciliation deltas, Stripe‑verified.”
• Queue Auto Page Maker updates and a light-touch provider announcement once All‑clear is live.

Product/Data
• Pin new dashboard tiles: onboarding success, account‑link success, median register→payouts‑enabled, endpoint P95s, Stripe probe success, ledger parity.

Day‑2 watchlist and abort criteria

Any ledger delta > $0.00, DLQ>0, backlog>30, or Stripe <99.5% → immediate rollback and page CEO.
Monitor cohort-specific latency; keep P95 ≤400 ms sustained, with callout if any endpoint exceeds 350 ms for >10 consecutive minutes.
