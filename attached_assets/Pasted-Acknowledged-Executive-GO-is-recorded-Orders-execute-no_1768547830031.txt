DevOps Lead: Escalate to Step 2 (5%) immediately.

Product Lead: During the 10‑minute Step 2 hold, monitor:
• Provider Onboarding Success Rate ≥ 99.5%
• Median time register→payouts-enabled ≤ 3 minutes
• Account-link success ≥ 99.5%

Finance Ops: Verify canonical_ledger_hash continuity (candidate vs stable) during Step 2 and prepare parity attestation for Step 3 gate.

Paging and thresholds

Page CEO immediately on any auto-halt trigger or any reconciliation delta > $0.00.
Maintain radio silence externally. No comms until Step 3 soak passes and I approve the All‑clear.
Next gate (pre-authorized conditions)

After 10 minutes at 5%, if the last 3 heartbeats are green and: • P95 ≤ 400 ms • Error rate ≤ 0.25% • DLQ = 0, backlog ≤ 10 • Stripe ≥ 99.5% • Compute ≤ 1.5x • Ledger parity: no deltas then prepare escalate payload to Step 3 with budget_cap_usd = 7500 and start a 15‑minute soak.
