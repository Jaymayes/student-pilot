Confirmed. Execute as planned. Below is the tight, operator-ready runbook for the next 24 hours with templates, commands, and decision gates.

What to do now (T+0 to T+2h)

Manual iOS/Safari validation (A1/A5)
Device: iPhone/iPad (Safari). Settings > Safari > Prevent Cross‑Site Tracking = ON. Clear Website Data.
Flow: A5 (student-pilot) → Sign In → A1 OIDC → Replit IdP → consent → back to A5.
Pass criteria: A5 receives code + state; user sees dashboard.
Evidence to capture (redacted): A1 logs hasCode=true, hasState=true; A5 shows authenticated user.
Fail path: Any callback?error or hasCode/hasState=false → file A1 + A5 ticket (templates below), keep paid HOLD, post incident note.
How to monitor (hourly, T+0 → T+24h)

Collect
Attempted logins (count), successful tokens issued (count), failure rate (%)
Top 3 failure reasons (redacted)
A1 p95 latency and uptime
A5 checkout initiation count vs 7‑day organic baseline
Report template (paste into Slack)
Hour: [UTC hh:mm]
Logins: attempted=[n], success=[n], success_rate=[%]
Callback errors (missing_parameters/server_error): [count] ([% of attempts])
A1 p95 latency=[ms], uptime=[%]
A5 checkout starts=[n] (baseline=[n])
Status: GREEN/YELLOW/RED. Notes: [one line redacted]
Quick validation commands (copy/paste)

A1 OIDC/CORS
curl -sI https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration
curl -sI -X OPTIONS https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/auth/user -H "Origin: https://scholaraiadvisor.com" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
A5 health/assets
curl -sI https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/health
curl -sI https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/assets/index.css
A6 prod sync check
curl -sI https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/healthz
A2 search latency sample (run 3x; note total time)
time curl -s "https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/search?q=engineering" >/dev/null
Decision gates for paid re‑enable (all must be true at T+24h)

iOS/Safari validation PASS (A5 receives code/state; session established)
Callback error rate ≤ 0.5% (rolling 24h)
Login success ≥ 99.2% (P95)
A1 p95 latency ≤ 250 ms; uptime ≥ 99.9%
A5 checkout initiation ≥ 7‑day organic baseline
If any gate fails

Keep paid HOLD. File ticket(s). Reassess at next hourly checkpoint.
Ticket templates (copy/paste, fill, file)

A1 Client Registration Update — student_pilot
App: student_pilot | Base: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
redirect_uris: ["https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/callback"]
post_logout_redirect_uris: ["https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app"]
scopes: ["openid","email","profile","offline_access"]
token_endpoint_auth_method: client_secret_basic
Evidence: callback?error=[server_error|missing_parameters] (redacted), timestamp [UTC], A1 diagnostics [hasCode/hasState flags]
A1 CORS & Cookie Alignment — scholaraiadvisor.com
Need: Allow scholaraiadvisor.com + www; SameSite=None; trust proxy; callback diagnostics active
Evidence: CORS preflight mismatch or callback error rate spikes > 0.5% (redacted)
A6 Republish Required — provider_register
Observation: /healthz 404/500 on production; local /health OK
Action: Republish in Replit UI; post‑publish verify /healthz 200, / 200, /api/login 302 → A1, protected 401
One‑liners for executive updates

Green (hourly): “A1 p95=XXXms; uptime=100%; logins: attempted [n], success [n] ([%]); callback errors [x] ([y%]); A5 checkout starts [n] vs [baseline]. Status GREEN.”
Yellow: “A1 p95=XXXms OK; callback errors at [0.7%]; monitoring next hour; paid remains HOLD.”
Red: “Callback errors [>1%] or iOS/Safari FAIL; pausing paid ramp; ticket filed [ID]; incident note posted.”
Ownership recap

Eng Lead: iOS/Safari validation (T+2h), hourly reports, ticket filing if needed
Growth Lead: Organic live now; paid staged; re‑enable only after Eng Lead confirms both iOS/Safari pass + 24h targets
A6 Owner: Republish if /healthz ≠ 200
You’re greenlit for organic, and the paid-traffic re‑enable is one successful iOS/Safari validation + 24 hours of clean telemetry away.
