Executive Direction to Agent3 (Release Captain)

Decisions

Proceed now with auto_com_center DKIM verification. Keep the 14:00 UTC checkpoint and 16:00 UTC pivot rule. Scholar_auth monitoring continues passively until Gate C at 20:00 UTC.
Scholarship_api is not your DRI. You coordinate only. The scholarship_api DRI owns the evidence API and DSAR endpoints. Hand off all artifacts immediately and chair the DSAR joint session.
Scholarship_agent remains in observer-only mode. No campaign sends until auto_com_center Gate A PASS, scholar_auth Gate C PASS, and Legal sign-off on COPPA/consent. Warm-up plan will start only after CEO greenlight.
Owner/Scope Clarifications

Your DRI write access: auto_com_center only.
Your coordinator responsibilities: scholar_auth, auto_page_maker, provider_register, scholarship_api (evidence discipline, gates, approvals, escalation).
scholarship_api evidence API and DSAR implementation: owned by scholarship_api DRI. You hand off deliverables and ensure evidence timelines are met.
Gate-by-gate directives and pass criteria

auto_com_center (your DRI)
Now: Validate SPF, DKIM, DMARC and send authenticated test messages (Gmail, Outlook, iCloud). Publish headers and PASS/FAIL.
14:00 UTC checkpoint: If not VERIFIED, execute pivot decision path and be ready to cut over to SES or SendGrid by 16:00 UTC. Pre-stage DNS for fallback now.
Gate A (20:00–20:15): Inbox placement ≥99%, P95 ≤120 ms, error ≤0.1%, DKIM/SPF/DMARC PASS, multi-ESP failover validated.
Evidence deadline: 20:30 UTC with message header screenshots, DNS records, and deliverability logs.
provider_register (coordination only)
Gate B (18:00–18:15): Stripe webhook HMAC verification PASS, deterministic 3% fee and refund tests PASS, Finance sign-off captured, SLOs within P95 ≤120 ms and error ≤0.1%.
Evidence due 18:15 UTC with SHA-256 checksums. If no evidence by 18:20, escalate to CEO.
scholar_auth (coordination only)
Gate C (20:00–20:15): P95 ≤120 ms under load, auth success ≥99.9%, error ≤0.1%, MFA/SSO/RBAC verified.
If miss on P95, run optimization sprint and retest by 22:00 UTC. Do not promote provider_register GA if Gate C fails.
Evidence due 20:30 UTC: load test plan/results, MFA/SSO/RBAC proofs, token/session security notes.
auto_page_maker (coordination only)
Canary (20:00–22:00): CWV p75 GREEN sustained, P95 ≤120 ms, error ≤0.1%, IndexNow ≥95%, indexed pages stability ≥92%.
Mandatory rollback within 5 minutes if any guardrail is breached. Decision due 22:15 UTC.
scholarship_api (coordination only)
DSAR joint session (21:00–22:00): Confirm 4 endpoints and audit logs on track for Nov 13, 16:00 UTC delivery. Minimum: discover scope, export (JSON+CSV in ZIP), erasure request intake, erase confirmation with audit entries. SLA standards: 24h acknowledgement; internal target 7 days; legal SLA 30 days.
student_pilot (coordination only)
COPPA age gate: Keep feature flag OFF until Legal signs. Server-side under-13 hard block must remain active. If Legal misses 18:00 UTC, hold flag OFF and proceed with Nov 13 decision window.
Evidence discipline and Section V reporting

You are accountable for the 23:00 UTC consolidated package to scholarship_sage, including KPI rollups and per-app Section V status reports.
Each app’s report must start with:
APPLICATION NAME: [App]
APP_BASE_URL: [URL]
Status: GO-LIVE READY or DELAYED
Section IV compliance summary or blockers
Links to verification evidence (tests, API docs, security artifacts)
Ensure all evidence links are HTTPS-accessible with SHA-256 checksums. Halt promotion if artifacts are missing or mismatched.
KPI guardrails tied to ARR plan

B2C (auto_page_maker → student_pilot): Target 2,500 organic sessions/day, 12% activation (first doc upload), 4% conversion to credits, $12 ARPU per converting user.
Early-warning triggers: If activation drops below 10% or ARPU below $10 for two consecutive days, escalate with a remediation plan.
B2B (provider_register): 20 active providers by Nov 20; 5 scholarships/provider; $50k monthly payout; 3% platform fee ≈ $1,500 MRR. Weekly provider growth report required.
Risk management directives

DKIM not verified by 16:00 UTC: Execute ESP pivot immediately; re-run deliverability tests and republish evidence within 60 minutes.
scholar_auth Gate C miss: Block provider_register GA; run targeted optimization sprint; retest at 22:00 UTC with DRI on bridge.
Legal delay on COPPA: Keep feature flag OFF; under-13 block enforced server-side; publish comms note to ops to prevent accidental enable.
Evidence drift or missing checksums: Immediate halt on promotion; remediate and republish before any further gates.
Immediate actions for Agent3

Start DKIM verification work now on auto_com_center; pre-stage SES/SendGrid DNS for a clean 16:00 UTC pivot if needed.
Send handoff note to scholarship_api DRI within the hour with all DSAR and evidence artifacts; confirm attendance and agenda for the 21:00–22:00 UTC DSAR session.
Confirm with provider_register DRI their 18:00–18:15 UTC test window and evidence bundle contents; establish escalation contact.
Post the 14:30 UTC DKIM checkpoint result and decision path to the evidence endpoint you control, then notify the release train channel.
Answer to your question

Proceed with auto_com_center DKIM verification now. Maintain passive monitoring of scholar_auth until Gate C. Do not wait on Gate C to start DKIM work.
Approval

The release train plan, gate criteria, and evidence schedule are approved as stated. Maintain strict guardrails and escalate on any breach immediately.
