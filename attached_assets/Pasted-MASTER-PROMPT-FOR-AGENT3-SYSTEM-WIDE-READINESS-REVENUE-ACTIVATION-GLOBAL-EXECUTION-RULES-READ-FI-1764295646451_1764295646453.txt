MASTER PROMPT FOR AGENT3: SYSTEM-WIDE READINESS & REVENUE ACTIVATION
GLOBAL EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

Identity Handshake: Before executing any logic, you must inspect your current environment and output exactly: IDENTITY CONFIRMED: [APP_ID] | [APP_BASE_URL]

Scope Discipline: You must ONLY execute the section of this prompt that corresponds to your specific APP_ID. Ignore all other sections completely. Do not attempt to fix or modify code in other applications.

Objective: Your goal is 100% Production Readiness TODAY. This means the app must be deployable, autonomous, and capable of processing its specific revenue-generating or supporting events.

Reporting: You must end your execution with a "Readiness Report" (template provided at the bottom). If you cannot be ready today, you must provide a precise ETA and a specific list of missing Third-Party Systems (e.g., Stripe keys, SendGrid API, Database URL).

Revenue Correction: The objective is to START generating revenue. (Ignore any previous instructions to "stop" revenue).

🟢 SECTION 1: scholar_auth
Target App: scholar_auth Base URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Your Mission:

Autonomy Check: Verify that token issuance (JWT) and refresh cycles happen automatically without manual intervention. Ensure OAuth (Google/Apple) callbacks are handling errors gracefully.

Data Reporting: Verify logs are capturing auth_events (login_success, login_failed, signup_new).

Revenue Criticality: You are the gatekeeper. If you fail, no one can pay.

Tasks to Fix/Verify:

Ensure JWT_SECRET is set in Secrets.

Verify CORS policies allow requests from student_pilot and provider_register.

Test the /verify-token endpoint used by scholarship_api.

Implement Rate Limiting on /login to prevent abuse.

🟢 SECTION 2: scholarship_api
Target App: scholarship_api Base URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Your Mission:

System Data Owner: You are the "Source of Truth." Verify that you are not allowing other apps to touch your database directly. They must use your API endpoints.

Autonomy Check: Verify the ingestion_engine is running on a schedule (cron) to fetch/update scholarship data automatically.

Data Reporting: Expose a /metrics endpoint showing: Total Scholarships, Total Users, API Latency.

Tasks to Fix/Verify:

Secure all endpoints (except /health) with Bearer Token auth (validate against scholar_auth).

Verify the Search Algorithm returns results in <200ms.

Ensure the POST /applications endpoint triggers a webhook to auto_com_center (for confirmation emails).

🟢 SECTION 3: scholarship_agent
Target App: scholarship_agent Base URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Your Mission:

Autonomy Check: Verify the "Campaign Engine" is active. It should autonomously select high-value scholarships and trigger auto_page_maker to build landing pages.

Data Reporting: Report on matches_found and campaigns_launched.

Tasks to Fix/Verify:

Connect to scholarship_api to fetch fresh inventory.

Verify logic: If scholarship_value > $10k, trigger "High Priority" workflow.

Ensure no hallucinations in match criteria (Strict constraints).

🟢 SECTION 4: scholarship_sage
Target App: scholarship_sage Base URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Your Mission:

Autonomy Check: Ensure the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline is automatically indexing new data from scholarship_api.

Data Reporting: Log queries_processed and student_sentiment_score.

Tasks to Fix/Verify:

Anti-Cheating Protocol: Verify guardrails are active. If a student asks "Write my essay," you must refuse and offer "Review my outline" instead.

Latency Check: Chat responses must be streaming or under 3 seconds.

🟢 SECTION 5: student_pilot
Target App: student_pilot (B2C Frontend) Base URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Your Mission:

Revenue Activation: THIS IS THE CASH REGISTER. Verify Stripe integration for "Premium Credit" purchases.

Autonomy Check: User signup -> Onboarding -> First Match must happen without human intervention.

Data Reporting: You must report conversion_rate (Free to Paid) and cart_abandonment.

Tasks to Fix/Verify:

Test the Checkout Flow. Does it redirect to Stripe? Does it handle the success_url webhook to provision credits?

Verify the Dashboard loads data from scholarship_api (not mock data).

Mobile Responsiveness check.

🟢 SECTION 6: provider_register
Target App: provider_register (B2B Frontend) Base URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Your Mission:

Revenue Activation: Verify Stripe Connect or Invoicing flow for the "3% Platform Fee."

Autonomy Check: A provider must be able to list a scholarship and see it go live (after automated safety check) without manual SQL entry.

Tasks to Fix/Verify:

Verify "Organization Verification" flow (KYC basics).

Ensure the "Dashboard" correctly displays applicant counts (pulled from scholarship_api).

🟢 SECTION 7: auto_page_maker
Target App: auto_page_maker Base URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Your Mission:

Autonomy Check: Programmatic SEO. When scholarship_agent sends a signal, you must auto-generate a static landing page (Next.js/React).

Data Reporting: Report pages_published and indexed_status (simulated or real).

Tasks to Fix/Verify:

Verify Sitemap.xml auto-updates.

Ensure pages have correct Schema.org JSON-LD for "Scholarship".

Check load speeds (Target: 90+ Lighthouse score).

🟢 SECTION 8: auto_com_center
Target App: auto_com_center Base URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Your Mission:

Autonomy Check: The "Central Nervous System." You process queues for Email (SendGrid) and SMS (Twilio).

Data Reporting: Report delivery_rate, open_rate, click_rate.

Tasks to Fix/Verify:

Verify API Keys for Email/SMS providers are present in Secrets.

Test the "Application Submitted" notification flow.

Compliance: Verify Unsubscribe logic is functional and autonomous.
