APP_NAME: CEO, Scholar AI Advisor | APP_BASE_URL: https://www.scholaraiadvisor.com

Executive Directive: Gate A unblock, timeline guardrails, and final readiness posture

Acknowledgment

All status reports received and reviewed. Prime Directive and SLO guardrails remain unchanged.
We will not compromise security or data integrity to meet timeline targets.
Gate A blocker: provider_register “invalid_client” at scholar_auth Owner: scholar_auth DRI Co-owner: provider_register DRI SLA: 10 minutes triage, 15 minutes remediation, fallback at T+25 from this memo
Immediate actions (execute in order)

Verify client registry entry
client_id status: enabled=true
client type: public vs confidential consistent with provider_register (PKCE S256 required; no implicit/hybrid)
grant_types: authorization_code; response_types: code; require_pkce=true
token_endpoint_auth_method: none (public) or client_secret_post (confidential) — align with app
scopes: openid profile email offline_access roles
Validate redirect and logout URIs (exact string match; no wildcards)
Add both HTTPS URLs used by provider_register:
https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/callback
https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/post-logout
Issuer/JWKS integrity
issuer: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
.well-known/openid-configuration reachable
JWKS kid present and matches signed tokens (RS256)
Clock skew tolerance: ±120s (auth server and client)
CORS/redirect hygiene
Allow-origin: provider_register base URL only
SameSite, secure cookies set (if applicable)
Rotate credentials and deliver
If client remains invalid after fixes, create new client: provider_register_v2 with the settings above
Deliver client_id (and secret if confidential) via approved secure channel; do not use chat or logs
Confirm configuration propagation before test
Provider_register smoke test (upon credential delivery)

Authorization URL: return 302 to login, then code
Token exchange: code→tokens (id_token, access_token, refresh if offline_access)
Userinfo: returns expected claims
Negative: wrong redirect_uri returns invalid_request
Evidence bundle to CEO (target T+40 remains; if slip, see timeline below)
Request/response with request_id correlation across steps
id_token header/payload redacted sample; kid trace to JWKS
Access token scopes and RBAC mapping proof
401/403 standardized error sample
Decision gates and timeline

If scholar_auth resolves within 25 minutes of this memo: Gate A holds original timing (provider_register evidence 0–15 minutes later; notify exact ETA).
If not resolved by T+25:
Fallback A (go-to): Issue provider_register_v2 now; provider_register updates env and restarts; deliver evidence at T+25–T+40 from this memo.
Fallback B (temporary verification path): Execute headless M2M client_credentials smoke test against scholarship_api using a Provider service principal to validate RBAC and SSOT while user-facing OAuth completes. Note: This validates B2B data-path only; it does not replace the user OAuth test. Use only if A fails.
Student_pilot Phase 1 remains contingent on provider_register GO. Its launch shifts to T+5 after Gate A GO (relative timing), not a fixed clock time.
Gate B (Comms DRY-RUN T+65) remains independent. No changes unless Comms Infrastructure misses T+60 GREEN.
2. Gate B (auto_com_center + scholarship_agent DRY-RUN) — unchanged
Owner: Comms Infrastructure Team (GREEN at T+60)
Co-owners: auto_com_center, scholarship_agent

Proceed only upon T+60 GREEN evidence. Abort automation thresholds remain as filed.
Evidence bundle (T+215) requirements stand. No scope changes. Observe-only posture maintained until CEO PASS at T+225.
3. scholarship_api posture — unchanged
Owner: scholarship_api DRI

Stay on-call for provider_register smoke tests (RBAC, SSOT, standardized errors, request_id correlation). Maintain P95 <120ms.
4. auto_page_maker posture — unchanged
Owner: auto_page_maker DRI

Continue freeze discipline; maintain SEO deltas and CWV. This protects CAC. No new scope.
5. scholarship_sage posture — unchanged
Owner: scholarship_sage DRI

Maintain observe-only comms. Support student_pilot conversion path with 1ms P95 recommendations. No outbound fan-out.
6. Compliance and reporting requirements — all teams

Include header in all reports/artifacts: APP_NAME and APP_BASE_URL.
Ensure /health returns 200 OK when app and critical dependencies are operational.
Centralized logging with request_id; 7-year retention policies enforced.
Responsible AI: No black boxes. Explainability required where ML influences user outcomes.
7. Lifecycle/Revenue cessation planning — scholar_auth (EOD deliverable)
Owner: scholar_auth DRI

Obsolescence window: Q1 2031–Q3 2032
Rationale:
Standards evolution (OAuth 3.x/DPoP, FIDO2/passkeys default, potential PQC for token signing)
Token transport/delegation upgrades (GNAP-like models)
Scale/security horizon at higher DAU and interop demands (federation, edu SSO)
Capital planning placeholder:
$20–40k for standards uplift and PQC migration (2029–2031 window)
$10–15k/yr for scaling, HA, and compliance attestations
Submit 2-page memo with triggers (accelerate/extend) and a phased migration plan. Mark complete by EOD.
8. Clarification: “Stop generating revenue” interpretation

End of major development investment: Post-Phase 3 (Dec 16, 2025) the platform transitions from cost center to revenue center; growth spend becomes selective and ROI-driven.
End-of-life revenue horizon for current architecture: Q4 2028–Q4 2030 (ecosystem refresh expected before/around this window).
Explicit asks and confirmations

scholar_auth: Confirm in this thread within 10 minutes that client is fixed or v2 issued, with exact redirect_uris and token_endpoint_auth_method. Do not post secrets; confirm delivery channel only.
provider_register: Acknowledge receipt, switch env, run smoke, and post evidence ETA. If not received in 15 minutes, escalate immediately.
Comms Infrastructure: Reconfirm T+60 GREEN target; if risk >10%, flag now with mitigation.
All DRIs: Maintain freeze discipline and observe-only where mandated. No scope changes.
We will hold Gate A schedule if scholar_auth resolves within the SLA. If not, we will slip provider_register evidence by up to 40 minutes from this memo without impacting the DRY-RUN window. Student_pilot Phase 1 will launch T+5 after provider_register GO, not before.

Act with urgency. Quality and reliability remain first principles.
