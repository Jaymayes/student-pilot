Acknowledged. No changes will be made. Below is a read‑only, black‑box test plan to diagnose why leads and revenue are not materializing, plus effort and timeline.

Executive context (why you see “zero” now)

We are in Provider‑Only failover. All student surfaces and notifications are suppressed by design, so B2C leads and credit revenue will be zero until Legal clears or failover is lifted.
This plan verifies whether: a) the “zero” is solely due to failover, and b) there are additional structural issues in acquisition, activation, or monetization that will still block growth after failover ends.
Scope and principles

Read‑only. No config flips, no traffic changes, no transactions. Data pulls, GET/HEAD pings, and log reviews only.
Evidence‑first. Every test produces a metric, an owner, and a pass/fail criterion.
Dual engine. We assess both funnels independently: B2C (students) and B2B (providers).
A. Platform‑level sanity checks (read‑only)

A8 ingestion health
What: Verify last 7 days event counts by stream: traffic/session, funnel (open→click→start→complete), monetization (credit_purchase_), provider (task_), incident/kill.
Why: Zero or near‑zero events indicates broken telemetry or routing.
Pass: Non‑zero event flow per stream; no schema mismatch spikes.
Owner: Ops/SRE + Data.
2. SLO snapshot vs budget

What: P95, error rate, queue depth, uptime; hourly spend vs $500 cap; compute_per_completion trend.
Why: Latency/Errors or runaway compute can choke conversions.
Pass: P95 < 1.2s normal; < 1.5s canary; error < 1.0%; queue ≤ 30; spend ≤ 80% of cap.
Owner: Ops/SRE.
3. Suppression and gating footprint

What: Share of traffic suppressed: under_13, no_consent, unsubscribed; cohort assignment including control/holdout.
Why: Over‑suppression or mis‑cohorting can drop volume to near zero.
Pass: Suppression distribution within historical bands; holdout near the configured 10% ±0.5pp.
Owner: Data + Legal.
B. B2C acquisition and activation (read‑only, while failover is active)
4) Organic acquisition (Auto Page Maker SEO)

What: Indexability and discoverability audit: canonical tags, robots, sitemap, schema.org, page load, lighthouse, 404/500 rates. Review Search Console/analytics coverage (impressions, CTR).
Why: If pages aren’t indexable or fast, you won’t get sessions.
Pass: Indexable pages, no accidental noindex, CWV LCP < 2.5s on 75th percentile, 0 major crawl errors.
Owner: Growth + Web.
5. Traffic attribution integrity

What: Sessions by source/medium/UTM; landing‑page to event linkage in A8.
Why: If attribution is broken, you can’t diagnose drop‑offs.
Pass: ≥95% of sessions carry source/medium; UTMs resolve to A8 sessions.
Owner: Growth + Data.
6. Activation funnel integrity (First Document Upload)

What: Rate per step: landing open → CTA click → signup → doc_upload_start → doc_upload_complete.
Why: Pinpoint where users quit.
Pass: Each step records events; typical benchmarks (for guidance): click‑through 3–8%, signup/start 30–50% of clicks, upload complete 50–70% of starts.
Owner: Product + Data.
7. Payments readiness (B2C)

What: Read‑only Stripe mode and errors: live vs test mode flags; credit_purchase_begin vs credit_purchase_success counts; top 5 error codes; refund rate and delta to baseline.
Why: Misconfigured payments yields zero revenue even with demand.
Pass: Live mode; non‑zero purchase_success in historical windows; refund < 2% and ≤ baseline +0.25pp.
Owner: Finance + Engineering.
C. B2B provider funnel (read‑only under Provider‑Only mode)
8) Provider activity and value

What: Logins/session length; tasks created/completed; time‑to‑first‑review; acceptance rate vs baseline.
Why: Confirms that the provider side remains healthy and valuable.
Pass: No >20% drop vs baseline in logins or TTR; acceptance ≥ baseline.
Owner: Growth + Product.
9. Provider acquisition funnel

What: provider_onboard_start → provider_onboard_complete → first_posting → first_review; support tickets by stage.
Why: If new providers aren’t activating, B2B engine stalls regardless of student volume.
Pass: >60% onboard completion; >40% posting; median time‑to‑first‑review within baseline.
Owner: Sales Ops + Product.
10. Compliance guardrails

What: Evidence that no student data appears in provider views during failover; audit log samples with OCA headers; PII checks.
Why: Avoid FERPA/COPPA violations that would halt growth.
Pass: 0 violations; complete audit trail for sampled actions.
Owner: Legal + Security.
D. Experiment and messaging integrity (read‑only)
11) Variant and control hygiene

What: Allocation drift; correct messaging rendered (compliance line); event parity across A/B/control.
Why: Broken variants or wrong copy break trust and measurement.
Pass: Drift ≤ 0.5pp; compliance text present on all surfaces; event schemas consistent across variants.
Owner: Ops/SRE + Growth.
12. Incident and kill‑trigger audit

What: Review kill events, near‑misses, escalations; RCA presence.
Why: Frequent auto‑kills signal reliability blockers to conversion.
Pass: No un‑RCA’d incidents; mean time to detect < 1 minute; mean time to resolve < 30 minutes.
Owner: SRE.
Outputs you’ll receive from this test (no changes required)

A single “Lead and Revenue Gap Map” showing, for each step in both funnels: traffic, conversion, SLO, top 3 defect signatures, and owner.
A quantified “what’s blocking revenue” call: Acquisition vs Activation vs Monetization vs Provider value vs Compliance.
An “effort to green” estimate per blocker with dependencies.
Most likely root causes to confirm or rule out quickly

B2C is intentionally zeroed by failover (expected).
SEO pages not indexed or are slow; attribution gaps; suppression too aggressive; payments not in live mode; excessive latency or error spikes at key steps; provider acceptance/backlog issues.
Effort and timeline

Diagnostic Sprint (read‑only; no changes)

Day 1–2: Pull A8 and Stripe readouts; SLO and budget traces; suppression/holdout analysis; provider activity metrics; incident review; SEO technical audit.
Day 3: Deliver Gap Map & Executive Readout with prioritized issues and fix list.
Remediation (post‑diagnostic; requires changes and separate approval)

Tier 1 (1–2 weeks): Fix top one or two bottlenecks that most affect revenue (e.g., payments mode/config, onboarding friction events missing, attribution patch, variant copy fix, SEO indexability). Parallel: stabilize SLOs if above thresholds.
Tier 2 (2–4 weeks): Structural improvements (e.g., activation flow UX, doc upload reliability, schema refinements, provider acceptance tooling).
Ongoing: Weekly A/B + cost telemetry governance; 24/7 SLO watch; quarterly SEO/landing refresh.
What I need to kick off the read‑only tests

A8 read access for events and dashboards.
Read‑only access to Stripe and Search Console/Analytics.
Current baselines for SLOs, acceptance, and key funnel rates.
I will return the Gap Map and a quantified “time to green” within 3 business days from data access, with an executive recommendation on where to invest first for leads and revenue.
