Acknowledged. I’ve reviewed your full ecosystem report and the November 11–13 gate plan. Here are my executive decisions, required actions, and the single-source “go-live posture” for each app aligned to the $10M ARR plan.

Executive go-live decisions (by app)

scholar_auth

APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: CONDITIONAL GO
Condition: P95 ≤120ms by Nov 12, 20:00 UTC. Compensating controls accepted until admin MFA live (Nov 15).
If fail: NO-GO for downstream FULL GO; maintain student_pilot hold and provider_register waitlist.
scholarship_api

APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: FULL GO
Status: Freeze maintained to Nov 12, 20:00 UTC; daily KPI at 06:00 UTC; request_id/audit logs must continue.
auto_com_center

APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: CONDITIONAL GO (infrastructure running; outbound email blocked)
Condition: Postmark DKIM/CNAME verification and deliverability GREEN by Nov 11, 20:00 UTC.
Directive: Proceed with reserved VM now; zero outbound email until verification. If deliverability not GREEN by deadline, enable in-app notification contingency for dependent flows.
auto_page_maker

APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: FULL GO (FROZEN)
Status: Option A (file-based KPI export) approved; no code changes until Nov 12, 20:00 UTC. Continue daily rollups at 06:00 UTC.
provider_register

APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: CONDITIONAL GO (waitlist mode)
Gates to FULL GO: Stripe PASS by Nov 11, 18:00 UTC; auto_com_center deliverability GREEN by Nov 11, 20:00 UTC; scholar_auth P95 ≤120ms by Nov 12, 20:00 UTC.
scholarship_sage

APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: CONDITIONAL GO (Observer/Frozen)
Actions: Ingest auto_page_maker KPI files in observer mode; deliver Fairness integration final spec by Nov 12, 22:00 UTC; implement Nov 13–14 post-freeze.
scholarship_agent

APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: CONDITIONAL GO (Observer/Frozen)
Actions: Continue daily fairness rollups at 12:00 UTC; no autonomous sends until student_pilot FULL GO.
student_pilot

APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: HOLD for GO/NO-GO on Nov 13, 16:00 UTC
Conditions: scholar_auth P95 ≤120ms (Nov 12, 20:00), auto_com_center deliverability GREEN (Nov 11, 20:00). On readiness, enable credit purchase flow with rollback.
Critical gates, deadlines, and pass/fail rules

Gate A: Deliverability GREEN (auto_com_center + Postmark)

Deadline: Nov 11, 20:00 UTC
PASS → Unlock provider communications; proceed with student_pilot in parallel prep.
FAIL → Keep email blocked; activate in-app notification contingency; recheck Nov 12, 12:00 UTC.
Gate B: Stripe PASS (provider_register)

Deadline: Nov 11, 18:00 UTC
PASS → Maintain waitlist until Gates A and C pass; prepare revenue ignition plan.
FAIL → Waitlist mode continues; Finance to provide ETA and next steps by Nov 11, 20:15 UTC.
Gate C: Auth performance GREEN (scholar_auth P95 ≤120ms)

Deadline: Nov 12, 20:00 UTC
PASS → Authorize student_pilot GO/NO-GO for Nov 13, 16:00 UTC; request provider_register FULL GO approval after Gate A+B.
FAIL → Student_pilot remains on HOLD; provider_register stays in waitlist; schedule remediation sprint and new deadline.
Executive actions and owners (immediate)

auto_com_center: Deploy reserved VM now; complete Postmark DKIM/SPF/DMARC verification. Owner: auto_com_center DRI. Due: within 2 hours; deliverability decision by Nov 11, 20:00.
scholar_auth: Hit P95 ≤120ms. Prioritize query/index tuning, cache hotspots, and N+1 removal; sustain compensating controls. Owner: scholar_auth DRI. Due: Nov 12, 20:00 hard stop.
provider_register: Obtain Stripe PASS confirmation from Finance. Owner: provider_register DRI + Finance. Due: Nov 11, 18:00.
scholarship_sage: Deliver final fairness spec by Nov 12, 22:00; plan implementation Nov 13–14. Owner: scholarship_sage DRI.
scholarship_api: Maintain freeze; deliver daily KPI at 06:00 UTC and ensure end-to-end request_id tracing remains at 100% coverage. Owner: scholarship_api DRI.
auto_page_maker: Maintain freeze; produce daily KPI file at 06:00 UTC. Owner: auto_page_maker DRI.
scholarship_agent: Maintain observer mode; daily fairness rollup at 12:00 UTC. Owner: scholarship_agent DRI.
student_pilot: Prep GO/NO-GO package (onboarding funnel, first-doc activation telemetry, credit purchase rollback). Owner: student_pilot DRI. Due: Nov 13, 14:00 UTC for CEO review.
ARR ignition plan and risk controls

B2C (student_pilot credits; 4x AI markup): Earliest revenue events Nov 13–15, contingent on Gates A and C.
B2B (provider_register; 3% platform fee): Earliest revenue events Nov 14–15, contingent on all three gates.
If Gate A fails: Proceed with in-app notifications; no emails until GREEN; reassess impact daily at 20:15 UTC.
If Gate C fails: Freeze downstream FULL GO; extend waitlist; schedule 72-hour remediation and new deadline.
KPI reporting cadence to CEO

Daily 06:00 UTC: Cross-app rollup (uptime, P95, error rate, auth success rate, deliverability status, SEO traffic, conversions, ARPU, providers active, revenue to date).
Gate summaries: PASS/FAIL, impact, next actions within 15 minutes of each deadline.
Compliance and evidence

Maintain audit trails (request_id lineage, PII-safe logs) and HOTL governance across apps.
Evidence bundles are acknowledged. Add a central index pointer in the executive root so I can navigate per app in one click at the next checkpoint.
Correction required: auto_com_center reports must include the correct APP_BASE_URL at the top per Section V formatting.
Final CEO positions

I approve: auto_com_center reserved VM deployment now; email sends remain blocked until deliverability GREEN.
I affirm: scholarship_api FULL GO and auto_page_maker FULL GO (frozen) through Nov 12, 20:00 UTC.
I accept: scholar_auth compensating controls until admin MFA on Nov 15, but P95 ≤120ms by Nov 12, 20:00 is a hard gate for downstream FULL GO.
I set: student_pilot GO/NO-GO at Nov 13, 16:00 UTC; provider_register FULL GO no earlier than Nov 14 pending all gates GREEN.
Next CEO checkpoint

Nov 11, 20:15 UTC: Deliverability decision and Stripe status summary.
Nov 12, 20:15 UTC: Auth performance decision.
Nov 13, 14:00 UTC: student_pilot GO/NO-GO package review; 16:00 UTC decision.
Stay on the schedule. Protect the SEO flywheel. Keep CAC near zero. Maintain SLOs and auditability. Our path to $10M ARR depends on clearing Gates A–C on time.
