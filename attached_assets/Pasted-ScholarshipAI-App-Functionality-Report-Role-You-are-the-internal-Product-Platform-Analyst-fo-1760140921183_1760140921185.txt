ScholarshipAI App Functionality Report

Role

You are the internal Product & Platform Analyst for ScholarshipAI. Your job is to produce a data-backed, decision-grade report on the functionality and health of our applications.
Objective

Deliver a comprehensive, current-state report of all ScholarshipAI apps and services, mapping functionality to student value, ARR drivers, and SLOs. Provide clear, prioritized actions for the next 30/90 days.
Scope

Include all live and staging applications in the ScholarshipAI ecosystem, including (but not limited to): Student App (discovery, profile, matching, document hub, application tracker, essay coach), Auto Page Maker (SEO engine), Scholarship Agent (autonomous marketing), Provider/Institution Portal (B2B marketplace), shared Database-as-a-Service app, workflow/orchestrator services, and analytics/monitoring.
Data Sources

Replit deployment dashboards: logs, resource usage, request durations, status codes; codebases and READMEs; API docs; internal telemetry; product specs; business KPIs. Where data is missing, note gaps and how to instrument them.
Deliverables

Executive Summary
Top findings, critical risks, near-term blockers, and highest-ROI opportunities. Tie explicitly to KPIs: B2C free-to-paid conversion, ARPU from credits, number of active providers, and 3% platform fee revenue. Call out CAC reduction levers via organic SEO.
2. App-by-App Functionality Deep-Dive (repeat for each app)

Purpose and primary users
Key features and user flows
Dependencies and integrations (internal/external); API endpoints, auth, and data contracts
Performance vs SLOs: uptime %, P95 latency, error rates; recent incidents and MTTR
Security & compliance: authN/authZ, secrets handling, data protection; internal-only Private Deployments usage; FERPA/COPPA/SOC 2 posture and gaps
Reliability patterns: retries with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, fallbacks; current coverage and gaps
Observability: logging, metrics, alerting; top error signatures
Risks and mitigations: vendor lock-in, scalability limits, agent reliability pitfalls
Roadmap: 0–30 day fixes, 30–90 day improvements, 90+ day strategic items
3. Architecture & Data Flow

System overview diagram showing inter-app communication (REST/webhooks/message queues), data ownership, and the Database-as-a-Service boundary
Where orchestration vs choreography is used today or recommended
4. Monetization Alignment

B2C: features that drive credit spend and conversion; alignment with 4x AI service markup; student value delivered
B2B: provider features enabling listings, promotion, analytics, and the 3% fee; gaps limiting partner onboarding or revenue
5. SEO & Acquisition

Auto Page Maker coverage, indexation, and traffic contribution; content gaps and quick wins to expand organic reach
6. Appendices

Inventory matrix (CSV): app name, URL, owner, deployment type, APIs, data stores, SLOs, alert channels
KPI snapshot and trends (last 30 days; note methodology and data quality)
Method

Enumerate all deployed apps and URLs; pull uptime, request durations, status code distributions, CPU/memory patterns from deployment dashboards
Extract and list APIs from code/README; validate auth and secrets usage
Sample logs to identify top 5 error signatures per app and their probable root causes
For each app, verify any implemented retry/backoff/circuit-breaker logic and propose concrete patterns where missing
Output Format

A written report with the above sections
One CSV named scholarshipai_app_inventory.csv with the app inventory
One system diagram (Mermaid or textual description) capturing inter-app data flows
Inline links to deployments, docs, and dashboards; explicitly flag unknowns
Success Criteria

Completeness across all applications; quantified findings; clear KPI mapping; prioritized, actionable next steps. Snapshot “as of [DATE]” with 30-day trend where available.
Why this prompt is structured this way

Replit’s deployment dashboard exposes request durations, status codes, logs, and resource usage needed for performance/SLO assessment, incident analysis, and MTTR improvements, which this prompt directs the agent to collect and summarize .
The Database-as-a-Service pattern, explicit API contracts, and hybrid orchestration/choreography guidance are included so the report surfaces architectural gaps and opportunities to harden inter-app communication and data ownership .
Reliability requirements (retries with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, fallbacks) and platform constraints (vendor lock-in, scalability limits, agent reliability) are emphasized so risks are identified with concrete mitigations .
Monetization and ethical guardrails orient the analysis toward ARR and student value (credits with 4x markup; essay coach positioned as assistive; B2B analytics and SOC 2 on the roadmap), aligning the functionality review with the 5-year plan .
