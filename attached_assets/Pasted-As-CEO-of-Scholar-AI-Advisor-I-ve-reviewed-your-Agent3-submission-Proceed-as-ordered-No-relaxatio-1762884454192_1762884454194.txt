As CEO of Scholar AI Advisor, I’ve reviewed your Agent3 submission. Proceed as ordered. No relaxation of gates or SLAs. Student funnel protection is non-negotiable. The following decisions, confirmations, and required actions are final.

auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: PENDING — Gate A deliverability
Decisions and orders:

ESP pivot authority: Approved as submitted. If DKIM CNAMEs are not provisioned by 14:00 UTC, pivot to SendGrid (preferred) or AWS SES (secondary) and be Gate A–ready by 19:00 UTC.
Gate A execution: 20:00–20:15 UTC. PASS requires all 6: inbox ≥80%, complaints ≤0.1%, bounces ≤2%, DMARC p=quarantine, SPF aligned, DKIM aligned.
Evidence SLA: Due 20:15 UTC. Include raw dig outputs (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), seed inbox screenshots, and ESP logs. Contingency:
If Gate A FAILS: Instant switch to in-app notifications; student funnel must not pause. Retry Gate A Nov 12, 12:00 UTC with the same 15-minute evidence SLA. Risk callout:
Primary risk is DKIM propagation. If at risk of missing SLA by >15 minutes, escalate immediately with mitigation and revised ETA.
scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: READY FOR GATE — Gate C on Nov 12
Decisions and orders:

MFA QA Evidence: Execute today by 23:00 UTC. Submit evidence in the prepared package.
Gate C performance window: Nov 12, 20:00–20:15 UTC. PASS requires P95 ≤120ms across 7 endpoints, error ≤0.1%, success ≥99.5%.
Security posture: Maintain PKCE S256, short-lived RS256 JWTs with jti anti-replay, HSTS preload, JWKS rotation, audit log lineage. Evidence SLA:
Due by 20:30 UTC Nov 12 (15-minute SLA). Include latency histograms, load-generator outputs (Artillery/k6), error budget, and security artifacts.
scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Frozen) — Approved
Orders:

Maintain freeze through Nov 12, 20:00 UTC. Keep SLO dashboards live. Preserve 5-minute rollback trigger.
Post-freeze: Enable DEF-005 multi-instance rate limiting with safe rollback by Nov 13, 12:00 UTC.
Continue supporting Gates A/B/C telemetry and events.
scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Observer/Frozen) — Approved
Orders:

No autonomous sends until Gate A PASS and student_pilot GO.
Parity remediation sprint: Nov 12–15. Evidence due Nov 15, 20:00 UTC. Keep rationale ≥95% and 100% request_id trails.
scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Observer/Frozen) — Approved
Orders:

Ship daily cross-app KPI rollup at 06:00 UTC. Integrate Gate A/B/C outcomes in the first rollup after each gate completes.
Fairness telemetry: Implement Nov 13–14 per spec, with E2E test and dashboard components.
student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: READY PENDING EXTERNAL GATES
Decisions and orders:

GO/NO-GO is Nov 13, 16:00 UTC, contingent on Gate A PASS, Gate C PASS, and activation telemetry.
In-app notification fallback is mandatory if Gate A fails; onboarding must not pause.
Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA ≥90% and keep PWA/offline plan Phase 1 on track.
provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Waitlist; Conditional GO)
Orders:

Gate B (Stripe) execution: Today 18:00–18:15 UTC. Evidence due by 18:15 UTC.
Required PASS evidence: Validated webhook signature; deterministic 3% platform fee event logging with request_id lineage; refund scenarios (0–48h full, 3–7d prorated, >7d none unless error); Finance sign-off.
Keep waitlist mode enforced until CEO FULL GO post Gate C.
auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Frozen) — Approved
Orders:

Maintain freeze through Nov 12, 20:00 UTC. Auto-hold page generation on CWV p75 regression or indexation <92%.
Continue 06:00 UTC SEO KPI exports. Post-freeze: structured data validation, 404/soft-404 monitoring, weekly crawl budget snapshot.
Cross-cutting executive requirements and deadlines
Security and compliance (all apps):

RBAC matrices: Submit per app by Nov 12, 18:00 UTC (roles, permissions, least-privilege checks).
Privacy/regs: Confirm FERPA/COPPA, GDPR readiness, DPA templates, and data subject request process by Nov 14, 18:00 UTC.
Encryption: Confirm TLS 1.2+ in transit and at-rest encryption configs by Nov 12, 18:00 UTC. Include KMS/key-rotation policies.
Reliability and DR (all apps):

Monitoring: Confirm uptime/error/latency alerting runbooks and paging policy by Nov 12, 12:00 UTC.
DR test: Organization-wide DR exercise Nov 17, 02:00–04:00 UTC; evidence due Nov 18, 12:00 UTC. Targets: RPO ≤15m, RTO ≤30m.
Integration and documentation:

API catalog: Publish a centralized index of OpenAPI specs and auth flows by Nov 12, 18:00 UTC. Include scholarship_api and scholar_auth as first-class entries, versioned, with examples and rate limits.
E2E integration testing: Deliver a signed report by Nov 12, 20:00 UTC proving scholar_auth → student_pilot → scholarship_api → auto_com_center happy paths and failure fallbacks.
Data governance and analytics:

Business events: Confirm canonical events and schemas (activation, provider fee accrual, deliverability metrics) are standardized and queryable by scholarship_sage by Nov 12, 12:00 UTC.
Data retention schedule: Consolidated cross-app policy due Nov 14, 20:00 UTC.
ARR ignition alignment

B2C credits: Earliest Nov 13–15 pending Gate A + Gate C + student_pilot GO. Ensure pricing, credits ARPU tracking, and first-document-upload activation telemetry are live in the 06:00 UTC rollup.
B2B 3% fees: Earliest Nov 14–15 pending Gate B + Gate C + CEO FULL GO. Keep waitlist enforced until then; provide Finance sign-off in Gate B evidence.
Escalation protocol

If any dependency or evidence will miss its SLA by >15 minutes, escalate to me immediately with root cause, mitigation, revised ETA, and impact assessment.
Format compliance

All evidence and reports must begin with: APPLICATION NAME: [App] APP_BASE_URL: [URL]
Several of your notes comply; ensure any remaining artifacts (especially auto_com_center Gate A evidence and provider_register Gate B evidence) follow the format.
Immediate next actions and owners

14:00 UTC: auto_com_center DKIM checkpoint; execute ESP pivot if needed. Owner: auto_com_center DRI.
18:00–18:15 UTC: provider_register Gate B; evidence by 18:15. Owner: provider_register DRI + Finance.
20:00–20:15 UTC: auto_com_center Gate A; evidence by 20:15. Owner: auto_com_center DRI.

Final CEO stance

Approved plans stand. Hit every gate and evidence SLA. Student funnel must not pause. Protect low-CAC SEO flywheel. Maintain SLOs. Drive toward $10M profitable ARR.
