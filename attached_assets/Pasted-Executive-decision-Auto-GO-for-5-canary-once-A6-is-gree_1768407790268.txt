Executive decision: Auto-GO for 5% canary once A6 is green and Legal signs off

Thank you for the thorough T‑1 report. Results meet or exceed all success thresholds. Proceed with an automated 5% canary once both gates clear.

Approval scope

Channel: Production
Traffic: 5% of eligible users, randomization locked
Window: 24 hours or 1,000 exposures (whichever occurs first)
Comms: Student and provider sequences enabled only for canary cohort
Pre‑launch gates (must all be green)

A6 Provider service: 60‑minute health window ≥ 99.9% uptime, P95 < 200 ms, error < 0.5%; provider_register smoke test returns 200 with OCA header present.
Legal: Signed approval of copy deck and consent language (record stored in repo and linked in A8).
Freeze: Code freeze across OCA‑touching repos during the 24‑hour canary.
Launch checklist (execute in order)

Flip feature flag one_click_apply.status = CANARY_5 and cap = 5%; rate_limit = 5/day; experiment window configured.
Enable provider dashboard banner and “Report Issue” auto‑disable workflow.
Send canary student emails (A/B split 50/50) to the eligible cohort; suppress under‑13 and no‑consent users.
Emit A8 event oca_canary_started with cohort_id, variant allocations, and SLO snapshot.
Start real‑time watch in A8 for:
SLO: P95 ≤ 1.5s, error < 1.0%, queue depth ≤ 30
Integrity: 100% ghostwriting refusals; 0 provider complaints
Refunds: < 2.0% 24h and ≤ baseline +0.25pp
Funnel: open ≥ 35%, CTR ≥ 8%, modal completion ≥ 70%, submit success ≥ 50%
Kill/rollback runbook (any trigger fires → act within 60 seconds)

Triggers: provider complaint ≥ 1, integrity violation ≥ 1, P95 breach for 5 consecutive minutes, error ≥ 1.0% for 5 minutes, refund > 2.0% 24h.
Actions: Set one_click_apply.status = DISABLED; publish oca_feature_killed with trigger; pause canary emails; notify providers via banner; root‑cause and produce fix/verify plan before any re‑enable.
Promotion criteria to 10% after 24h

Integrity: 0 provider complaints; 0 confirmed violations
Performance: P95 ≤ 1.5s; error < 1.0%; queue depth ≤ 30
Finance: refunds ≤ baseline +0.25pp and < 2.0% 24h
Provider: acceptance rate no negative delta vs baseline
Growth: completion rate lift ≥ +10% vs control with stable refund/complaint rates
Reporting cadence

T+2h: initial health ping in A8 with SLO and early funnel read
T+6h: executive midpoint snapshot
T+24h: canary readout and 10% recommendation
Budget

T‑1 spend: ~$45 noted; approved to use the remaining dry‑run/canary budget up to $500 total for this 24‑hour window. Existing red‑team/load testing budgets remain in force.
Outstanding gates and owners

A6 green: Engineering Lead (target: within 12 hours)
Legal sign‑off: General Counsel (due: 4 hours)
Once both gates are green, proceed automatically and post the oca_canary_started event in A8. If either gate misses the deadline, escalate to me with a revised timeline and risk assessment.
