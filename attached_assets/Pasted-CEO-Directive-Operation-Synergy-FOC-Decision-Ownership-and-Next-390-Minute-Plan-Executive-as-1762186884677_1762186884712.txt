CEO Directive: Operation Synergy — FOC Decision, Ownership, and Next 390-Minute Plan

Executive assessment

scholar_auth: READY. All CEO-mandated artifacts delivered with hashes; RBAC enforced; discovery/JWKS healthy. Action required: complete the two client config fixes you identified.
scholarship_api: GREEN & FROZEN. P95 within SLO; RBAC and standardized errors verified. No blockers.
scholarship_sage: GREEN & FROZEN. Recommendations v1 stable; P95 well inside SLO; security and compliance confirmed. No blockers.
scholarship_agent: GREEN & FROZEN. Automation, event emissions, and circuit breakers ready. No blockers.
auto_page_maker: GREEN & FROZEN. 2,101 pages live; SEO hygiene validated. No blockers.
provider_register: GREEN FOR E2E upon auth confirmation. Tenant isolation plan is solid; waiting on auth SSOT signal.
student_pilot: TECHNICALLY READY but BLOCKED on invalid_client. Config correct; awaiting auth client registration completion.
auto_com_center: STANDING BY. Needs Comms Infra “GREEN – Canary Stable” signal (heap headroom ≥30%, no DLQ growth).
CEO decisions and approvals

Deliverables acceptance: I accept the submitted Section 7 reports, SSOT packages, and proof bundles for scholar_auth, scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, and auto_page_maker.
Fallback authorization: If student_pilot lacks a successful round-trip by T+45, Auth DRI is authorized to issue a 24-hour “student-pilot-temp” client (PKCE S256, scopes as specified). Frontend must rotate to the permanent client within 24 hours of issuance.
auto_com_center DRY-RUN: Approved to proceed immediately upon Comms Infra posting “GREEN – Canary Stable.” Limit to allowlisted test recipients; no production exposure.
SEO submission cadence: Approved. Growth DRI to submit sitemap to GSC in a rolling pattern post-Go: 10% Day 1, 30% Day 3, remaining 60% Day 7, with daily crawl budget monitoring and rollback plan.
Freeze discipline: Maintained. Only permitted changes until Go/No-Go: secrets, issuer URLs, autoscaling and GC tuning, monitoring/observability, and incident playbook content. Any code/schema/API change requires CEO approval and resets freeze clock.
Immediate actions, owners, and deadlines

Auth DRI (deadline T+15, hard stop):
Complete student_pilot client registration; re-post SSOT parity matrix and client registry proof.
Apply production CORS hardening by T+4h as previously noted.
Frontend DRI — student_pilot (start upon Auth GREEN, complete by T+150):
Execute 30-sample E2E: target ≥98% auth success, P95 ≤120ms for top 5 endpoints, zero critical 5xx, Lighthouse Accessibility ≥90.
Submit evidence bundle with SHA256 manifest immediately after completion.
Frontend DRI — provider_register (start T+150, complete by T+270):
Execute 30-sample RBAC and tenant isolation E2E; verify 3% fee disclosure is present; confirm P95 ≤120ms; submit evidence bundle with SHA256 manifest.
Comms Infra (deadline T+255 to enable auto_com_center window):
Resolve canary heap pressure with GC/autoscaling tuning; run 10-minute rolling soak; post “GREEN – Canary Stable” with metrics: heap headroom ≥30%, DLQ growth = 0, error rate ≤0.1%.
auto_com_center DRI (window T+270–T+390; fallback T+330–T+450):
On green signal, run pre-flight (15 min), execute 5× DRY-RUN (30,000 events total), collect evidence (delivery ≥99%, zero DLQ growth, opt-out <5s), submit SHA256 manifest and final Section 7.
scholarship_agent DRI (parallel with auto_com_center DRY-RUN):
Provide event volume and confirm circuit breakers engaged; capture provider receipts and queue-depth graphs.
FOC acceptance gates (must pass)

Platform SLOs: 99.9% uptime; P95 ≤120ms across user-critical endpoints.
Security: OIDC sole issuer; JWKS verification; RBAC 401/403 negative tests; 6/6 security headers; CORS locked to approved origins.
Errors and tracing: Standardized JSON errors with request_id across all services.
auto_com_center DRY-RUN: ≥99% delivery success; zero DLQ growth; opt-out latency <5s; CAN-SPAM/GDPR/FERPA checks pass.
B2C readiness (student_pilot): Auth success ≥98%; Lighthouse Accessibility ≥90.
B2B readiness (provider_register): 30-sample tenant isolation proof; 3% fee disclosure present.
KPI instrumentation for this window

B2C funnel (student_pilot): signup completion rate, first-session activation rate, auth success rate, P95 for top 5 user flows, error budget burn.
B2B funnel (provider_register): provider auth success, time-to-first-scholarship, RBAC isolation violations (target 0), API P95.
Communications: delivery success %, bounce %, spam complaint rate, unsubscribe latency, DLQ depth (target 0), circuit-breaker open rate.
SEO engine: pages indexed/day, average CWV (TTFB, INP, LCP), impressions/clicks from long-tail terms; CAC proxy improvements.
Risk controls and contingencies

If student_pilot fails E2E by T+150: restrict to invite-only cohort, capture HAR + logs, remediate, re-run at T+210; fallback client expires at T+24h regardless.
If provider_register fails isolation tests: freeze writes to provider-created scholarships; hotfix only with CEO approval; re-run at T+330.
If auto_com_center fails any DRY-RUN gate: abort after run 2, enable auto-rollback, preserve queue, no outbound to production; provide root-cause analysis and revised soak plan.
Compliance guardrails remain in force: Responsible AI coaching-only for essays; no ghostwriting; no PII in URLs; FERPA/COPPA alignment.
Lifecycle confirmations (Section 6)

Infrastructure (auth, api, coms): 5–7 year horizon; current estimates land Q4 2030–Q3 2032 across components, subject to OAuth standard shifts and scaling needs.
User-facing (student_pilot, provider_register): 3–4 year horizon; student_pilot refresh expected ~Q3 2028; provider_register ~Q2 2029.
Intelligence/automation (sage, agent, page_maker): 2–3 year horizon; current estimates: Q2 2027–Q4 2028; auto_page_maker refresh budget earmarked $40–60k.
Capital allocation and constraints

Approve up to $20k for Comms Infra optimization to secure canary stability (heap/GC tuning, autoscaling, observability).
Reserve $40–60k for auto_page_maker refresh in 2027 to protect low-CAC engine.
No additional paid acquisition; continue to prioritize SEO-driven growth via Auto Page Maker.
Go/No-Go posture

Conditional GO pending two gating signals:
Auth GREEN: student_pilot client registered and one successful auth round-trip (or temporary client at T+45).
Comms Infra GREEN: “GREEN – Canary Stable” posted before T+270.
If both gates pass and E2E/DRY-RUN evidence bundles meet acceptance thresholds, I will issue final GO at T+390 (or T+450 if the DRY-RUN slips).
Final instructions

DRIs: Acknowledge this directive in your ops channel and post GREEN/RED status at each checkpoint with links to evidence bundles and SHA256 manifests.
No code changes without CEO approval until Go/No-Go. Secrets/config only as specified.
Keep me updated every 30 minutes with a succinct status: blocker, owner, ETA, and risk to T+390.
Act with urgency. Operation Synergy is the linchpin to our $10M ARR path; success depends on low-CAC SEO acquisition, seamless auth, and reliable communications. Proceed.
