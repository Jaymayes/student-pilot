Executive decision from the CEO of Scholar AI Advisor acknowledged. Prime directive applied to maximize ARR velocity with risk controls. Direction below is final.

Immediate decision on your access constraint

Direction: Pursue Option A now. Operator: open the auto_com_center workspace and instantiate Agent3 there for Gate A execution. If Maintainer access is not confirmed within 10 minutes, execute Option B (API-only fallback) and raise P1 “AUTO_COM_CENTER ACCESS” until IDE access is granted. This preserves the Gate A schedule while de-risking deliverability verification dependencies. This also aligns with our HOTL governance and approval-gate model for autonomous operations to maintain explainability and auditability during critical changes .
Gate windows and go/no-go criteria are approved as proposed. Maintain the SLO guardrails (99.9% uptime, ≤120ms P95 latency) and deliverability KPIs exactly as written. Evidence must include transparent audit trails to avoid “black box” outcomes consistent with our Responsible AI policy  .

Status reports by application (per Section V format)

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: PENDING GATE (Gate A at 20:00–20:15 UTC)

Current stance: Gate-ready. Pre-flight signals are strong; 30K webhook replay still requires execution during the Gate.
Pass criteria: Inbox placement ≥95%; P95 ≤120ms; error rate ≤0.10%; SPF/DKIM/DMARC PASS; 30K webhook replay clean with idempotency and order guarantees.
Action to greenlight: Execute Gate A as DRI inside workspace, collect full evidence bundle, publish SHA-256 manifest by 20:30 UTC, then deliver the executive GREEN/YELLOW/RED summary by 20:45 UTC.
Risk notes and mitigations: Replit infra carries scalability/lock-in constraints; enforce autoscale and rigorous observability, and keep rollback pre-staged. Keep human-on-the-loop approval gates for any config change that could affect deliverability reputation .
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: PENDING GATE (Gate C at 20:00–20:15 UTC)

Requirements emphasis: MFA/SSO, RBAC, token/session hardening, TLS 1.3 throughout, strong crypto at rest, and comprehensive audit logs. Confirm OpenAPI for SSO/issuer metadata and role claims mapping. Evidence must include auth headers, key rotation policy, and UAT traces.
Compliance posture: Align with zero-trust, modern crypto, secure key/session lifecycle. Publish attestation for TLS, AES-256, JWT handling, and HSM-backed secrets where applicable .
Decision rule: GREEN if all auth tests pass, logs are explainable, and UAT completes without P1/P2 defects; else YELLOW with 24-hour re-run.
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: PENDING GATE (Gate B at 18:00–18:15 UTC)

Decision timeline: PASS/FAIL due by 18:20 UTC.
What I need in the evidence bundle: RBAC by provider roles, secure onboarding flows, encrypted data at rest/in transit, API contract with scholarship_api, and operational monitors. Include disaster recovery plan excerpt and backup test proof per our readiness checklist .
Third-party dependencies: Payment gateway, domain verification, and email callback paths must be validated with test transactions and audit logs.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Compliance Hold)

Blockers: Legal sign-off on ToS/Privacy/COPPA and Gate A + C PASS.
Next action: After Legal approval, flip FEATURE_COPPA_AGE_GATE = true and restart with monitoring. Ensure continuous verification of authentication signals and enforce privacy-by-design; all logs must be explainable and exportable to support audits .
Estimated Go-Live: Nov 13–14 16:00 UTC window, contingent on tonight’s Gates.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: OBSERVER MODE (No sends)

Directive confirmed: No sends until Gate A + Gate C PASS and Legal sign-off. Prepare day-1 warm-up cohorts and suppression lists only.
Evidence requirements: Rationale coverage, fairness telemetry, suppression logic, and rollback plans. This preserves trust and responsibility boundaries around autonomous actions and avoids black-box behaviors in campaign targeting .
Cross-cutting directives and governance

Security and compliance: Enforce TLS 1.3, encryption at rest, RBAC everywhere, MFA/SSO at scholar_auth, and immutable audit logging. Publish attestation in tonight’s evidence package per our deployment readiness standards .
Observability and rollback: Maintain full request_id lineage, P95/P99 latency histograms, error budgets, and circuit breakers. Pre-stage rollbacks at the app level. This is essential given Replit’s performance and lock-in constraints; our mitigation is rigorous testing, staged rollouts, and human approval gates for high-risk changes .
Strategic alignment and ARR: Tonight’s gates unlock the Nov 13–15 ARR ignition window. B2C uplift is driven by email lifecycle and credit sales; B2B GMV flows via provider_register with a 3% platform fee. This sequencing keeps CAC low through organic SEO while connecting to our roadmap that fuses essay-coach insights into matching for higher conversion and retention .
Reporting commitments to the CEO (unchanged)

18:20 UTC: Gate B PASS/FAIL with evidence summary and remediation ETA if needed.
20:45 UTC: Gate A + Gate C GREEN/YELLOW/RED and GO/NO-GO recommendation for sends and student_pilot timing.
23:00 UTC: Consolidated evidence package delivered to scholarship_sage with SHA-256 manifest, KPI rollups, and audit trails, aligning to our deployment readiness discipline .
Final instructions to unblock execution

Ops: Provision Maintainer access to auto_com_center now; confirm within 10 minutes. If not, Agent3 proceeds via API-only fallback and raises P1 until access is granted.
Agent3: Enter change freeze at 19:45 UTC and execute Gate A with no context switching. Use the prepared checklists and publish the evidence bundle by 20:30 UTC. Maintain Responsible AI explainability in all artifacts to comply with our governance model and external audits .
This directive is final. Execute.
