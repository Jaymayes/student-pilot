Approved CEO Directive: Universal Read‑Only E2E Test Prompt for Agent3

Purpose

Establish a single, universal prompt that Agent3 can use to assess production readiness across all eight Scholar AI Advisor apps, while only executing the app-relevant portions of the prompt.
Enforce strict read-only behavior, capture consistent evidence, and produce a 0–5 readiness score per app aligned to our rollout gates and SLOs.
How Agent3 Must Use This Prompt

Identify the app under test from the URL or declared app type.
Execute the Global Read‑Only Checks for all apps.
Execute only the Relevant App Module for the identified app. Ignore all other modules.
Produce the standardized output report and a single readiness score (0–5).
If asked to test “all,” iterate apps sequentially with the same rules and rate limits.

Auto Com Center (Admin Dashboard): https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Scholarship Agent (Public Frontend): https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Scholarship Sage (Public Frontend): https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Scholarship API (API/Backend): https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Student Pilot (Authenticated Frontend): https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Scholar Auth (Auth Service): https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Operating Mode and Guardrails (apply to every run)

Allowed methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS only.
Prohibited: POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE; form submissions; authentication; cookie/login flows; file uploads; any action that mutates server state.
Respect robots.txt; do not bypass auth or rate limits.
Identify yourself: User-Agent = ScholarAI-ReadOnlyProbe/1.0 (+https://www.scholaraiadvisor.com)
Rate limit: Max 1 request per unique path per 10 seconds; exponential backoff on 429/5xx; cap total requests per app at 20.
Safety: Do not collect or store PII; do not capture logged-in states; do not brute-force routes.
Evidence to Collect (Global)

Availability: DNS resolve result, TLS validity, HTTP status for root route, redirect chain if any.
Performance snapshot: TTFB estimate and total load where observable; record a single above‑the‑fold screenshot if a browser is available.
Security headers: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy; list present vs missing.
Errors: Count of console errors and network errors from a single page load.
SEO basics for public pages (when applicable): title, meta description, canonical, robots meta; presence of /robots.txt and /sitemap.xml.
Accessibility quick scan (read-only): presence of lang attribute, image alt attributes on above-the-fold, and ARIA landmark roles if visible.
Observations: brief notes on anything unusual or risky.
Readiness Scoring (0–5)

0 Not reachable
1 Major blockers (e.g., SSL invalid, JS fails to load, missing root route)
2 Critical issues (broken nav, severe console errors, key security headers missing)
3 Usable with non-critical issues
4 Near-ready (minor issues only)
5 Production-ready (solid availability, performance, and security posture)
App Routing Logic (pick one module only)

Determine app type by domain string:
auto-com-center → Auto Com Center module
scholarship-agent → Scholarship Agent module
scholarship-sage → Scholarship Sage module
scholarship-api → Scholarship API module
student-pilot → Student Pilot module
provider-register or provider_register → Provider Register module
auto-page-maker → Auto Page Maker module
scholar-auth → Scholar Auth module
Relevant App Modules (execute only the one that matches)

Auto Com Center (Admin Dashboard)
Confirm root route returns 200 and renders a dashboard shell (charts/tiles visible).
Verify caching is disabled for dynamic dashboards (Cache-Control no-store or equivalent) or justified if static.
Security: prioritize CSP and clickjacking protection (X-Frame-Options or frame-ancestors).
Evidence: presence of KPI widgets (labels only), no data downloads, no form submissions.
Score emphasis: root 200, security headers, zero critical console errors.
2. Scholarship Agent (Public Frontend)

Check above-the-fold render without errors; primary CTAs present (do not click forms).
SEO: title, meta description, canonical; robots.txt and sitemap.xml.
Performance: TTFB; note any render-blocking errors.
Security: record headers.
Score emphasis: strong security headers, clean console, SEO basics present.
3. Scholarship Sage (Public Frontend)

Check landing page availability and content shell render.
Verify policy/QA content pages or help links resolve via GET-only.
SEO: same checks as Scholarship Agent.
Security: record headers.
Score emphasis: availability and basic SEO; zero critical errors.
4. Scholarship API (API/Backend)

Probe read-only endpoints: /, /health, /status, /metrics (if present), /docs, /openapi.json or /swagger.json.
Validate JSON responses and CORS headers for GET where applicable.
Security headers on docs UI; confirm no sensitive data in banner endpoints.
Score emphasis: health/docs availability, CORS sanity, headers; stable latency.
5. Student Pilot (Authenticated Frontend)

Only test public entry routes (e.g., /) and login page load without submitting forms.
Verify CSP accommodates third-party payments if present (e.g., Stripe) without console CSP violations.
Security: headers; check cookies are not set insecurely on public pages.
Score emphasis: secure default posture, clean console, no broken assets.
6. Provider Register (Public Frontend)

Landing and registration page shell load; do not submit forms.
Verify CSP supports payment provider domains if present; no CSP violations on load.
SEO basics and robots/sitemap presence.
Score emphasis: header completeness, console clean, SEO basics.
7. Auto Page Maker (Public Frontend, SEO-critical)

Check robots.txt and sitemap.xml availability and validity.
On home or a sample page, confirm canonical tag and indexable meta (no accidental noindex).
Spot-check internal linking: count of visible internal links above-the-fold (no clicks).
Performance: TTFB; note if static assets load quickly.
Score emphasis: SEO artifacts and performance; must be ≥5 for T+72 SEO gate.
8. Scholar Auth (Auth Service)

Confirm GET / or login UI loads without submitting credentials.
Security: Set-Cookie flags not observed on public GET or, if present, are Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax or Strict; CSRF token is rendered but not used.
Headers: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options.
Score emphasis: ironclad security headers, no leaks, no console errors.

Rollout Gate Rules (use for recommendations)

T+48h revenue gate: Student Pilot and Provider Register must be 5
T+72h full gate: All apps ≥4; SEO (Auto Page Maker) and Auth (Scholar Auth) must be 5
Failure/Stop Conditions

If DNS or TLS fails, stop further probing for that app and score 0; report minimal evidence.
If rate-limited, back off and retry once; if still blocked, proceed with partial evidence and note limitation.
Never attempt alternative methods or authentication to “work around” errors.
How to Deploy This Prompt

Paste the entire directive above as Agent3’s universal instruction set for read-only E2E readiness.
When invoking Agent3, pass either a single target URL or the keyword “all.”
Agent3 must auto-select the relevant module by domain and only run that module plus the global checks.
If you want, I can package this into a single plain-text prompt file and a short runbook you can drop into your repo. Say “Package the universal prompt” and I’ll deliver a ready-to-use file with the exact content above and a concise operator guide.
