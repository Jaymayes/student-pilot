CEO Executive Decision Memo — Agent3 Scope

Prime Objective
Drive toward soft launch readiness while protecting brand trust and SEO flywheel. All actions must serve our 5-year plan to reach $10M profitable ARR with low-CAC, SEO-led growth and Responsible AI.

Executive Summary

Gates: Deliverability GREEN and Stripe PASS remain the only external blockers to revenue. Pre-soak proceeds as planned.
Decision: Maintain comms/charging freeze until both gates are GREEN.
Readiness: student_pilot and auto_com_center will execute tonight’s milestones on schedule, pending DNS_READY and Stripe PASS from their owners.
Immediate Executive Orders

Deputy Ops (DNS): Post DNS_READY with SPF/DMARC records by 17:30 UTC. If missed, escalate to CTO and authorize fallback subdomain immediately.
Agent3 (Deliverability): Execute T+90 certification the moment DNS_READY lands. Post evidence bundle within 15 minutes of completion.
COO/Finance (Stripe): Post PASS evidence by 19:00 UTC. If missed, provide an ETA and mitigation; student_pilot paid flows remain frozen.
All DRIs (Pre-soak): Run 20:00–21:00 UTC window. Deliver T+30 evidence by 21:30–22:00 UTC. Roll back and publish 60-minute RCA if any guardrail fails.
Technical Guardrails (must pass tonight)

Uptime ≥99.9%
P95 latency ≤120 ms (≤200 ms end-to-end)
Error rate ≤0.1%
request_id lineage across auth → API → app
PKCE correctness and immediate token revocation proof
No PII in logs (FERPA/COPPA), redaction verified
Responsible AI controls active; no academic dishonesty enablement
Capital and Vendor Strategy

Stay with Postmark shared transactional pool for inbox placement; do not switch vendors unless seed placement <80% after two remediations.
No dedicated IP until steady-state volumes justify warm-up without risking deliverability.
KPIs for this phase

Deliverability: ≥90% inbox placement (seed), ≤10% Gmail Promotions, open rate ≥40% on activation.
Activation: ≥35% first-session activation (first document upload) for student_pilot.
Payments (post-Stripe PASS): ≥95% auth success; 100% refund success on test cases.
Required Evidence (tonight)

Pre-soak T+30: latency histograms, uptime, error tallies, PKCE proof, token revocation test, request_id lineage samples, no-PII log validation, executive summary.
Deliverability T+90: DNS screenshots, Postmark verification, 7 seed inbox headers (SPF/DKIM/DMARC PASS, alignment), placement rates, bounce and blocklist checks, DMARC policy confirmation.
Status Reports (Section V format)

APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

Blockers:
Deliverability GREEN (dependent on DNS_READY → T+90).
Stripe PASS (COO/Finance).
Pre-soak pass (scheduled 20:00–21:00 UTC).
Estimated Go-Live Date:
Soft launch target: Nov 11, 16:00 UTC, contingent on all gates GREEN.
Conditional slip: Nov 12, 16:00 UTC if exactly one gate slips ≤24h with mitigation.
ARR Ignition:
Start: Nov 11–12 on credit sales (4x AI service markup); provider comms after Deliverability GREEN.
Third-Party Dependencies:
scholar_auth (OIDC/PKCE/SSO), scholarship_api (data), Postmark via auto_com_center (transactional mail), Stripe (payments), monitoring/alerting stack.
Notes:
Pre-soak evidence due 21:30–22:00 UTC.
FERPA/COPPA/no-PII logging checks included.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

Blockers:
DNS_READY (Deputy Ops) for mail.scholaraiadvisor.com (or pre-approved interim).
Estimated Go-Live Date:
Deliverability GREEN at T+90 from T0 (DNS_READY), no later than Nov 10, 14:00 UTC (contingency).
ARR Ignition:
Enables activation and transactional communications for B2C/B2B funnels immediately upon GREEN.
Third-Party Dependencies:
Postmark (sending), DNS provider (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), seed inbox accounts.
Notes:
Success criteria: SPF/DKIM/DMARC PASS with alignment, ≥90% inbox placement, ≤0.3% bounce, zero blocklists.
Risk and Mitigation

DNS slippage: Authorize alternate subdomain and fast-propagation nameservers. Keep seed tests ready for immediate rerun.
Stripe delay: Proceed with all non-charging flows; rehearse idempotent retries and refund paths in test mode; do not charge until PASS.
Performance outliers: If P95 breaches during pre-soak, execute rollback and RCA within 60 minutes; tune hot paths before re-entry.
CEO Decision

Approved: Tonight’s pre-soak, deliverability T+90 upon DNS_READY, evidence deadlines, and continued comms/charging freeze until both gates GREEN.
Not approved: Any vendor switch or dedicated IP warm-up prior to data-supported need.
Escalations: If DNS_READY not posted by 17:30 UTC, escalate to CTO and proceed with fallback subdomain. If Stripe PASS not posted by 19:00 UTC, require ETA and mitigation; maintain freeze.
Close
Execute with urgency. Post evidence to the Master Index as specified. I will issue the Nov 11 soft launch GO/NO-GO based on tonight’s evidence and the two gates.
