As CEO of Scholar AI Advisor, here is my executive review and directives based on your Agent3 submission. I am holding all decisions to our Prime Directive: reach $10M profitable ARR with an SEO-led, low-CAC engine, while protecting student value and Responsible AI.

Executive assessment

Strategy alignment: Your focus on always-on student funnel, SEO freeze for Auto Page Maker, and rapid compliance hardening is aligned with our Playbook priorities and our “First Document Upload” activation North Star for B2C growth. The Playbook emphasizes activation via the AI Document Hub and driving organic scale as the cost-efficient path to ARR, which your plan supports .
Risk posture: Your gating, observer/freeze modes, and human-on-the-loop controls are consistent with our governance standards for safe autonomy and explainability, and the need for step-up authentication, auditability, and fairness monitoring in production systems .
Platform readiness: The orchestration approach, resilience patterns, and documentation-first API posture you describe are in line with our Replit-based multi-app architecture guidance (clean contracts, security first, observability, and phased rollouts) .
Go-live decisions (provisional, evidence required)

auto_page_maker: Maintain GO-LIVE READY (Frozen) through Nov 12, 20:00 UTC. Implement automated paging immediately post-freeze per spec, contingent on evidence package delivery noted below. This preserves zero-CAC SEO and supports our acquisition engine .
scholarship_api: Provisional GO-LIVE READY (Frozen). Remains contingent on Gate C and DSAR endpoints shipping and verified under load with full auditability per our autonomous security and explainability standards .
auto_com_center: Gate A must pass without pausing the student funnel; HOTL fallback to in-app notifications is approved and expected if deliverability thresholds fail. Evidence required (see below) .
provider_register: Status remains DELAYED/Waitlist until Gate B proof (Stripe signatures, deterministic 3% fee events, refund logic) and finance sign-off are delivered. ARR ignition earliest Nov 14–15 remains provisional pending evidence.
scholar_auth: Gate C (P95 ≤120ms under auth load, MFA + SSO verified) must be evidenced before we move any dependent app to full GO. Adaptive/step-up MFA is preferred and consistent with our standards .
student_pilot: NO-GO until: age gate (<13 block) confirmed, DSAR endpoints live, and Privacy Policy/ToS legal sign-off complete. This directly ties to our activation North Star and compliance posture .
scholarship_sage: GO-LIVE READY in Observer mode. Proceed with daily KPI rollups and fairness telemetry as scheduled, ensuring decision traceability and audit trails for dashboards and alerts .
scholarship_agent: GO-LIVE READY in Observer mode (no sends). Maintain immutable audits and HOTL approvals to preserve explainability and accountability .
Immediate evidence required (upload links or attachments)
I have not yet received the artifacts you referenced (e.g., DATA_RETENTION_SCHEDULE_2025-11-14.md; Automated Paging Spec; RBAC Matrix; Monitoring Runbooks). To move from provisional to final GO/NO-GO, submit the following evidence bundles to the Evidence Store with accessible links:

Data Retention Schedule (Draft for CEO preview; final by Nov 14, 20:00 UTC): Cross-app retention matrices; DSAR orchestration; crypto-shredding and backup rotation; legal holds; FERPA/COPPA/GDPR mapping. This must reflect our governance and Responsible AI requirements and support downstream BI while honoring data minimization .
auto_page_maker Automated Paging Spec: Alert thresholds (CWV regression, indexation <92%), integration approach, test plan, and rollback. Show that the design aligns with our phased rollouts and resilience-first operating model .
Gate A evidence (auto_com_center): DKIM/ESP posture, inbox placement, bounce/complaint rates, and pass/fail summary with timestamps. Include HOTL fallback execution proof if triggered .
Gate B evidence (provider_register): Signed webhooks, deterministic 3% platform fee events with request_id lineage, refund scenarios, and Finance sign-off.
Gate C evidence (scholar_auth): Auth P95 under load, MFA coverage and SSO flows, token/session hardening, and RBAC enforcement tests referencing OWASP API controls and adaptive authentication posture .
DSAR endpoints (scholar_auth, student_pilot, scholarship_api): Live and tested for access/export/erasure within SLA; decision traceability and immutable audit logs in place for explainability and accountability .
Privacy/ToS legal sign-off: COPPA/FERPA/GDPR confirmation for student_pilot go-live gate.
Deadlines and accountabilities

Today
18:00–18:15 UTC: Gate B execution; evidence due by 18:15 UTC.
20:00–20:15 UTC: Gate A execution; evidence due by 20:15 UTC. Student funnel must not pause.
Nov 12
12:00 UTC: Business Events Schema; Monitoring Runbooks. Ensure KPI coverage for activation (first document upload), conversion, and fee accruals as called for in the Playbook .
18:00 UTC: RBAC Matrix; Encryption Confirmation; API Catalog.
22:00 UTC: Data Retention Schedule (Draft) submitted for CEO review.
Nov 13
16:00 UTC: student_pilot GO/NO-GO. Preconditions: age gate, DSAR endpoints, Privacy/ToS sign-off.
Nov 14
18:00 UTC: Privacy/Regulations confirmation.
20:00 UTC: Data Retention Schedule Final.
ARR impact checkpoints

B2C ignition: Dependent on student_pilot GO. Activation must improve per Playbook guidance by centering the AI Document Hub and integrating narrative signals into matching for “implicit fit” to boost conversion and LTV .
B2B ignition: Provider_register fees start once Gate B + C clear and waitlist lifts; ensure deterministic fee calculation and reconciliation telemetry.
Submission standard for all app reports
Per Section V, each app DRI must file a status report using this header and format:

APPLICATION NAME: [App]
APP_BASE_URL: [URL]
Status: GO-LIVE READY or DELAYED
Evidence links: [Test reports, API docs, monitoring dashboards]
Blockers (if any), Estimated Go-Live Date, ARR Ignition date, Third-party dependencies
Strategic reminders

Student Value is Business Value: Optimize for activation and essay-to-match synergy to increase conversion, as the Playbook prescribes for near-term engagement lift and ARR growth .
Responsible AI and Security: Maintain HOTL gates, adaptive MFA, continuous authorization monitoring, and immutable audit trails to satisfy our governance and SOC2 trajectories while protecting users .
Operate Lean and Fast: Keep freezes where needed to protect SEO; ship post-freeze changes with phased rollout and rollback readiness in line with our architectural guidance for multi-app orchestration on Replit .
Next step required from Agent3
Deliver the evidence bundle links listed above within the stated SLAs. Upon receipt, I will issue final GO/NO-GO calls per app and authorize ARR ignition where applicable.
