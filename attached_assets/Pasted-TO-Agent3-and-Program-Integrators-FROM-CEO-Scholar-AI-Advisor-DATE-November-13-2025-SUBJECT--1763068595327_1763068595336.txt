TO: Agent3 and Program Integrators
FROM: CEO, Scholar AI Advisor
DATE: November 13, 2025
SUBJECT: Executive Decisions, Go/No-Go Gates, and Blocker Resolution Plan

Prime directive alignment

Objective: Hit ARR ignition on Nov 20 and sequence phased go-lives without compromising security, reliability, or student value. Organic growth via Auto Page Maker remains the CAC engine.
Executive go/no-go decisions

auto_page_maker
Decision: GO-LIVE APPROVED (effective immediately).
Conditions: Submit sitemap to Google Search Console today; daily indexation and crawl-error monitoring.
KPIs: Indexed URLs, crawl errors, click-through rate, conversion to sign-ups from SEO pages.
2. auto_com_center

Decision: GO-LIVE CONDITIONAL APPROVAL for Nov 14, 2:00 PM MST.
Conditions already met per your evidence: templates env-based; P95 45.33 ms at 200 rps; 0% errors; bounce/drop monitoring; secrets audited and stored.
Final gate (must pass before production traffic flip):
Canary: 30 minutes at 250 rps, P95 ≤120 ms, error rate <0.5%.
Live webhook round-trip E2E from scholarship_api staging event → auto_com_center → email provider sandbox → delivery webhooks recorded.
Hypercare: 24 hours post-cutover with on-call rotation.
Critical path and deadlines (all times MST)
A) scholar_auth (highest priority)

Deadline: Nov 15, 12:00 PM
Must-have deliverables:
OAuth2 Client Credentials flow live for services (scholarship_agent, scholarship_sage, scholarship_api).
JWTs with roles and scoped permissions embedded; standardized role names and backward-compat mapping.
CORS allowlist locked to approved frontends only; fail-fast on unauthorized origins.
MFA: end-to-end enrollment + challenge verified in staging with real session.
HA config (Reserved VM/Autoscale) ready; rolling restart playbook drafted.
Acceptance tests:
OIDC discovery reachable; JWKS rotation tested.
3 service clients receive tokens; each succeeds in token introspection and scope-constrained calls.
3 user roles demonstrate least-privilege authorization across two apps.
B) scholarship_api

Deadline: Nov 17, 12:00 PM (contingent on scholar_auth)
Must-have deliverables:
Stable JWT validation under load (no intermittent signature failures).
Data governance: enforce business-rule validations for submissions; clear error payloads.
/health deep checks: DB connectivity, cache, auth provider reachability, dependency liveness.
Event hooks: emit status-change events to auto_com_center (staging first).
HA and autoscale configuration finalized.
Acceptance tests:
k6 load run: 300 rps for 15 min; P95 ≤120 ms; errors <1%.
10 negative-validation test cases return correct 4xx with actionable messages.
Health endpoint degrades when DB or auth is intentionally severed; alerts fire.
C) student_pilot

Deadline: Nov 18, 6:00 PM
Must-have deliverables:
Environment-only configuration for all URLs (confirmed complete per your note; run config linter to prove zero hardcoded URLs).
Graceful error states for auth/API failures; clear retry/refresh prompts.
Decision: Offline mode scope—defer unless mobile is confirmed for Q1; instrument local caching only for read-only views if trivial.
Acceptance tests:
E2E “Student Journey” in staging: Register → Login (MFA) → Profile → Recommendations → Apply → Confirmation.
Frontend chaos tests: API 500s simulate user-friendly fallbacks.
D) provider_register

Deadline: Nov 18, 6:00 PM
Must-have deliverables:
Env-var refactor to zero hardcoded URLs (12 files identified) and central schema validation.
Robust error handling; empty states and retries for transient failures.
Ready for RBAC roles from scholar_auth (provider_admin, reviewer, super_admin).
Acceptance tests:
E2E “Provider Journey” in staging: Register → Create Scholarship → View Applicants → Update Status (events fired to auto_com_center).
E) scholarship_sage

Deadline: Nov 19, 12:00 PM
Must-have deliverables:
Switch tests from mock to real M2M tokens/scopes: students.read, scholarships.read.
Re-run performance and accuracy suites on production-like data.
Acceptance tests:
P95 ≤120 ms, precision@10 ≥60% on real data; Responsible AI logs present with hashed student IDs only.
F) scholarship_agent

Deadline: Nov 19, 6:00 PM
Must-have deliverables:
S2S auth integration live; scheduled jobs out of “dry run.”
Admin monitoring for job success/failure, retries with backoff; audit logs exportable.
Acceptance tests:
3 scheduled jobs execute in staging, trigger auto_com_center, and log audit trails; alerting on failure threshold.
War-room schedule and ownership

Stop-ship criteria and rollback

Any auth token validation flakiness in production-load replay.
P95 >150 ms sustained for 10 minutes during canary.
Error rate ≥1% on critical paths.
Immediate rollback plan: blue/green with traffic shifter, 5-minute RTO; DB migrations reversible or gated.
Security, compliance, and observability directives

SOC 2 control mapping: access controls, log retention, change management—publish control checklist by Nov 18.

Alerts: auth failures, 5xx spikes, event delivery failures, bounce rates, queue backlogs.
Immediate unblockers and executive actions

Ops: Confirm Agent3 write access to auto_com_center is active; if not, grant within 1 hour. Send confirmation in the 4:00 PM war-room.
scholar_auth: Freeze all non-P0 features until OAuth2 CC, RBAC claims, CORS lockdown, and MFA E2E pass.
SRE: Prepare k6 scripts and canary orchestrations for scholar_auth and scholarship_api by Nov 14 EOD.
ARR ignition plan (Nov 20)

B2C:
Pricing: enforce 4x markup on AI services; track ARPU from credits.
Funnel KPIs: SEO visits → sign-ups → MFA-completed logins → credit purchases; daily dashboard.
B2B:
Provider acquisition: 25 active providers by Dec 15; enforce 3% provider fee; invoice automation via scholarship_agent + auto_com_center.
CAC:
Auto Page Maker SEO: indexation ramp target—2,000+ URLs live now; 4-week CAC reduction target 20–30%.
North-star weekly targets (starting Nov 20 week):
Student paid conversions: +10% WoW
Providers onboarded: +10 net new/week
SLO adherence: ≥99.9% uptime, P95 ≤120 ms
Requests to Agent3 (today)

Provide the following by 9:00 PM MST:

Final notes

We will not miss the Nov 20 ARR ignition. All dates above are firm. Escalate blockers immediately in the war-room; do not work around security fundamentals.
Student value drives revenue: prioritize clarity, reliability, and ethical use in every flow.
Acknowledge receipt and confirm owners/dates in the 4:00 PM MST war-room.
