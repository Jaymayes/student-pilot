AGENT3 UNIVERSAL QA AUTOMATION v2.2 — COMBINED APPS (READ-ONLY)

Executive intent

Mission: Validate production readiness for each app independently and verify ecosystem cohesion, so all apps are 100% ready and work together for the 72-hour Universal Prompt rollout.
Scope: HTTP-only, read-only E2E checks. No data mutations beyond safe GETs and documented self-tests. No code changes. Produce standardized artifacts and a single ecosystem matrix.
Critical instruction: Only use the section for your app. Ignore all other app sections except the explicit cross-app pings inside your section.
App directory and selection

Apps and base URLs:
auto_com_center: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholar_auth: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
student_pilot: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
provider_register: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_page_maker: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_api: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_agent: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_sage: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
App selection protocol (mandatory):
If env var AGENT3_APP is set, use that exact app section.
Else, if the base URL you were invoked with matches one of the above, use that app’s section.
Else, call GET /agent/capabilities or GET /health or GET / to discover the app identity from headers or JSON (e.g., appName).
If identity remains ambiguous, stop and ask for operator input. Do not run multi-app checks.
Common rules for all apps (apply to your app only)

Read-only execution. Do not POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE. If a self-test endpoint requires a token, document that fact and skip.
Rate limiting: ≤ 1 request per endpoint per second. ≤ 3 samples per endpoint for TTFB/P95 estimation.
Evidence-first: For every finding, capture response code, timing (TTFB), selected headers, and a small JSON snippet (or HTML title) to prove correctness.
Security headers checklist (score individually): Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.
Performance target: P95 TTFB ≤ 120ms for critical endpoints.
Uptime/SLO proxy: Health endpoints must return 200 consistently during sampling unless app’s section specifies a degraded but acceptable dev-mode behavior.
SEO checklist (where relevant): robots.txt 200, sitemap.xml 200, meta title and description present on root page, canonical tag on content pages.
Observability and error handling: 404/422/500 error responses should be structured JSON for APIs (with correlation_id or trace_id if applicable). No PII in error payloads.
Authentication and authZ: Public endpoints should not require auth; protected endpoints should; do not attempt login unless the app’s section explicitly permits a read-only check.
Artifacts (you must produce all):
e2e/reports/{app}/readiness_report.md (detailed evidence, pass/fail by criterion, timings)
e2e/reports/{app}/fix_plan.yaml (prioritized P0/P1/P2, code/config snippets, ETA, risk, validation/rollback notes)
e2e/reports/ecosystem_readiness_matrix.csv (append or update 1 line for your app; keep header)
Scoring rubric (report a single integer 1–5):
5/5: All acceptance criteria pass; P95 TTFB ≤ 120ms; security headers pass (≥ 5/6, none critical missing); no blockers.
4/5: Acceptance criteria pass; minor performance or security deviations; no blockers; clear fix plan to reach 5/5.
3/5: One or more acceptance criteria fail; not production-ready.
2/5 or 1/5: Multiple critical failures; not production-ready.
Gate mapping (include your gate view in the report):
T+24h gate: Infrastructure/API core healthy (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, and any infra-labeled apps must be ≥ 4/5).
T+48h gate: Revenue apps (student_pilot, provider_register) must be 5/5.
T+72h gate: All apps ≥ 4/5, with revenue apps still 5/5; security and performance SLOs green.
Standard data you must record in your report (for your app)

Endpoint inventory tested with method, status code, and 3 timing samples; P95 as reported.
Security headers presence/absence with examples.
SEO file validity (robots.txt, sitemap.xml) and core page meta tags.
Error-handling examples (404/invalid-id).
Known issues (from your section) re-validated as present or resolved.
Final score, risk, and whether your app blocks any gate.
Your single-line CSV row fields: app,status,p95_ttfb_ms,security_headers,key_blocker,eta_hours_to_resolve,notes
status = pass|conditional|fail
security_headers = pass|partial|fail
key_blocker = brief description or none
Per-app sections (only use the section that matches your app)

auto_com_center (Executive Command Center)
Base URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Critical endpoints to test:
GET / (root)
GET /health and GET /healthz
GET /agent/capabilities
GET /api/monitoring/dashboard
GET /api/executive/kpi/latest
GET /api/executive/kpi/history
GET /robots.txt, GET /sitemap.xml
Acceptance criteria:
All endpoints 200 OK except healthz may report degraded in dev with clear messaging.
P95 TTFB ≤ 120ms for critical endpoints (root, dashboard, kpi/latest). kpi/history ideally ≤ 120ms but may be documented if temporarily > 120ms with fix plan.
Security headers: ≥ 5/6 present; CSP must not be “Report-Only” in production.
Executive endpoints require API key in production (document dev fallback behavior).
External app reachability check: record per-app GET /health or root TTFB for the other 7 apps (do not treat their failures as your failures—just report).
Known issues to re-validate:
Occasional high memory leading to /healthz degraded.
KPI history endpoint > 120ms.
Slow sitemap.xml generation; needs caching.
CSP enforcement and Exec API key requirement in production.
Fix plan guidance:
Add cache for sitemap.xml.
Create indexes/caching for KPI history or materialized rollups.
Enforce API key checks outside dev; enforce CSP (no report-only).
Memory profiling; increase heap or remove hotspots.
Deliverables: Create readiness_report.md, fix_plan.yaml, update ecosystem_readiness_matrix.csv.
2. scholar_auth (OIDC/SSO)

Base URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

GET /robots.txt, GET /sitemap.xml
Acceptance criteria:
health returns 200 with basic service info.
OIDC discovery document returns 200 with issuer, authorization_endpoint, token_endpoint, jwks_uri, scopes_supported.
P95 TTFB ≤ 120ms for health and discovery.
Security headers ≥ 5/6.
No sensitive data in error responses; CORS policies reasonable for relying parties.
Known issues to re-validate:
None pre-loaded; verify production readiness posture.
Fix plan guidance:
Ensure stable JWKS caching and rotation window.

P95 TTFB ≤ 120ms on root and scholarships; if slightly above, document and propose fix.
Security headers: ≥ 5/6 and SEO meta title/description present at least on root.
Known issues to re-validate:
Reports conflict on headers and performance; your job is to measure and resolve inconsistency with evidence.
Fix plan guidance:
Add HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy if missing.
Optimize slow pages (cache API calls, static render, CDN).

Acceptance criteria:
Root and key pages return 200; health returns 200 if present.
OIDC redirects are not followed; only capture that endpoint exists and responds.
P95 TTFB ≤ 120ms for root; if higher, document and propose fix.
Security headers: ≥ 5/6.
Known issues to re-validate:
Missing /api/health; root ~226ms.

Fix plan guidance (priorities and success criteria):
P0 capacity: reduce memory to <75% sustained 30+ min; error rate <0.15% sustained; DB P95 <45ms sustained; reconnect Redis with cache hit rate >70%; restore missing endpoints to 200.
P1 monitoring/analytics: reinstate RUM/metrics; validate dashboards.
P2 improvements: minor config and header polish.
Deliverables: readiness_report.md, fix_plan.yaml, matrix update.
Execution workflow (for your app only)

Identify your app using the selection protocol. Abort if ambiguous.
Inventory endpoints as listed in your section. Perform up to 3 timed GETs per endpoint; record min/avg/P95 from your samples. Respect rate limits.
Capture security headers for at least root, health, and one critical API.
Validate SEO files (where relevant) and at least one content page’s basic meta tags.
Trigger only safe invalid-id checks documented in your section to validate error handling.
Cross-app ping (only if your section explicitly instructs it). Do not score other apps; just note connectivity latencies.
Score your app using the rubric and determine gate impact.
Generate artifacts:
readiness_report.md: executive summary, evidence table, acceptance criteria status, performance/security sections, gate result, final score, and explicit next steps to reach or sustain 5/5.
fix_plan.yaml: list fixes with fields [id, priority: P0/P1/P2, description, rationale, snippet_or_command, owner_role, eta_hours, risk_level, validation_steps, rollback_plan].
ecosystem_readiness_matrix.csv: update or append one line with your app’s status. Preserve the header row.
Exit cleanly. Do not modify app state. If any acceptance criterion remains ambiguous due to missing docs, mark as “needs verification” and specify the exact evidence required.
Scoring and gates reminder

Your final output must include a single readiness score (1–5) and whether your app blocks T+24h, T+48h, or T+72h.
Revenue apps (student_pilot, provider_register) must be 5/5 to clear T+48h.
All apps must be ≥ 4/5 by T+72h; revenue apps remain 5/5.
Operator handoff

If any required endpoint is missing, document the exact route, the expected behavior, and include a minimal code/config snippet in fix_plan.yaml to add it.
If performance exceeds P95 120ms target, propose concrete caching/indexing/CDN steps with expected improvement and validation method.
If a security header is missing, provide a one-liner configuration example (e.g., Express, Nginx) and explain the intended policy briefly.
Reminder

Only use the part of this prompt that applies to your app. Ignore other sections unless your section explicitly includes cross-app reachability checks. The objective is to deliver your three artifacts and an accurate line in the ecosystem_readiness_matrix.csv that decision-makers can trust.
