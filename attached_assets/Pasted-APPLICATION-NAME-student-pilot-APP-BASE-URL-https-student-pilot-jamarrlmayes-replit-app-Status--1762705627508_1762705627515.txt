APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

Blockers

Pre-Soak Evidence Gate: Awaiting Nov 9 internal pre-soak pass (uptime ≥99.9%, P95 ≤120ms, error ≤0.1%, E2E request_id lineage, PKCE validation, immediate revocation proof).
Deliverability Gate: Outbound comms (activation and nudges) gated on auto_com_center + Postmark GREEN certification.
Payments/Credits: B2C credits flow gated on Stripe PASS and webhook reliability confirmation.
Estimated Go-Live Date

Internal pre-soak: Nov 9, 20:00–21:00 UTC (as scheduled)
External soft launch: Nov 11, 2025, 16:00 UTC (contingent on Deliverability GREEN by Nov 10 and pre-soak PASS Nov 9)
ARR Ignition

B2C: Earliest Nov 11–12 window (once Deliverability GREEN + pre-soak PASS). Revenue driver: credit sales with 4x AI service markup and low-CAC SEO flywheel activation.
Third-Party Dependencies

scholar_auth (OIDC/PKCE for B2C; immediate token revocation)
scholarship_api (student and scholarship data access)
auto_com_center + Postmark (transactional emails, list-unsubscribe, domain alignment)
Stripe (payments for credits)
Hosting/infra: Replit (app), object storage provider for document uploads
Section IV Compliance Summary (student_pilot)

Security & Compliance: Auth via scholar_auth with OIDC/PKCE; RBAC/scoped tokens applied in API calls; HTTPS enforced; audit lineage via request_id. Formal encryption-at-rest verification evidence to be included in pre-soak bundle.
Scalability & Performance: Targets aligned to P95 ≤120ms per app; load and E2E latency checks included in pre-soak.
Integration & Interoperability: Reads from scholarship_api using tokens from scholar_auth; comms via auto_com_center. API contracts verified in pre-soak.
Reliability & DR: DR plan documented; monitoring/alerting active. Evidence of uptime/error SLOs to be posted post pre-soak.
Data Management & Analytics: Data integrity checks and activation funnel telemetry included in pre-soak; no PII in client logs.
Usability & Adoption: Responsive UX validated; in-app guidance queued; email nudges gated by deliverability.
Central Admin: User/session oversight via scholar_auth; audit review via request lineage.
Configurability: Feature flags for activation nudges; email templates controlled via auto_com_center.
Support & Maintenance: On-call and incident response in place; updates follow freeze windows.
Offline Mode: Not in scope unless mobile client introduced.
Testing: Functional/security/performance/UAT included in pre-soak; integration with auth/api/comms in scope.
Deployment: Controlled freeze; rollback plan documented.
Strategic Fit: Anchors B2C growth and activation KPIs (activation ≥35%, email open ≥40% seed-adjusted).
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

Blockers

DNS_READY Signal: Awaiting Deputy Ops to publish and confirm SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and MX for sending subdomain (e.g., mail.scholaraiadvisor.com or interim).
Postmark Domain Verification: Depends on DNS propagation; DKIM selectors must be added post verification.
Seed Inbox + Bounce/Blocklist Tests: Held until Postmark verifies domain.
Estimated Go-Live Date

If DNS_READY posted by 14:00 UTC Nov 9: GREEN certification by T+90 → Nov 9, 18:00 UTC
If DNS_READY slips past 14:00 UTC: Nov 10, 2025, 14:00 UTC (contingency window)
ARR Ignition

Indirect driver. Required gate for B2B (provider_register) Nov 10–11 and B2C (student_pilot) Nov 11–12. No direct revenue, but blocks activation and conversion comms if not green.
Third-Party Dependencies

Postmark (sending domain, SPF/DKIM/DMARC verification, blocklist/bounce analytics)
DNS provider (TXT/MX records)
Seed inboxes (Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo/Proton/iCloud)
Compliance headers (List-Unsubscribe), domain alignment (SPF/Return-Path/From)
Section IV Compliance Summary (auto_com_center)

Security & Compliance: Uses platform auth for admin; enforces HTTPS; CAN-SPAM compliance with list-unsubscribe; DMARC policy warmup p=quarantine with plan to p=reject post-stability.
Scalability & Performance: Designed for high-volume transactional sends; monitoring for delivery rate and latency; capacity scales via ESP.
Integration & Interoperability: Auth via scholar_auth; event webhooks/logs feed evidence index; templates drive student_pilot/provider_register comms.
Reliability & DR: Evidence pipeline with T+90 certification; monitoring and alerting on bounces and blocklists; rollback is disable-sends + revert to verified fallback domain if needed.
Data Management & Analytics: Seed placement reporting; bounce analysis targets (<0.5% target, <0.3% ideal).
Usability & Admin: Granular admin for templates/policies; audit logs retained for review.
Configurability: DMARC policy staged rollout; template and sender identity controls.
Support & Maintenance: On-call with incident thresholds; hourly status until GREEN.
Testing: Domain verification → seed tests → headers/domain alignment proof; evidence bundle on completion.
Deployment: Controlled domain warmup; no mass sends until GREEN certification.
Strategic Fit: Unlocks low-CAC lifecycle comms critical to activation and conversion.
Assigned Applications (Agent3)

student_pilot (DRI)
auto_com_center (Deliverability T+90 executor)
Immediate Next Actions

Await DNS_READY from Deputy Ops to start auto_com_center T+90 pipeline.
Execute Nov 9 internal pre-soak and publish T+30 evidence bundles per SLOs.
Hold external comms and charging until Deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS.
Notes

B2B/provider_register and payments/Stripe are owned by their respective DRIs/COO; student_pilot will not initiate paid flows until Stripe PASS is posted.
All evidence will be posted within 15 minutes of milestone completion per operating cadence.
