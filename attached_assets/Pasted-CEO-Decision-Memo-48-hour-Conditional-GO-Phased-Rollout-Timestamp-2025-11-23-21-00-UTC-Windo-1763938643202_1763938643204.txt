CEO Decision Memo — 48-hour Conditional GO, Phased Rollout

Timestamp: 2025-11-23 21:00 UTC
Window: T+0 to T+48
Objective: Evidence-backed GO/NO-GO at T+24; execute first live-dollar test in T+24–T+48 if all gates pass

Executive Decisions (Effective Now)

Conditional GO with Three Non‑Negotiable Gates
Status: NO-GO to live dollars until all three gates are evidenced. Claims without evidence are treated as unverified.
Gate 1 (Payments): Stripe LIVE keys + webhook 200 OK + receipt notification proof
Gate 2 (Security & Performance): Auth + API 401/200 and P95 ≤120ms proof
Gate 3 (CORS): Strict allowlist, no wildcards; preflight pass/fail proof
2. Auto Page Maker: GO for Phase 1 with guardrails

Throughput: 200–500 pages/day starting now
Domain and Canonicals: Use pages.scholaraiadvisor.com (or www.scholaraiadvisor.com/scholarships) only. No third-party or legacy domains. All canonical tags and sitemaps must reflect scholaraiadvisor.com.
CTA: “Apply Now” → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app with UTM tracking
Evidence due by T+24: sitemap.xml URL, robots.txt, GSC property verification, sample of 10 live URLs, structured data validation, and Network tab showing 200 responses with no CORS errors
Quality: No thin/duplicate pages; intent-cluster internal links; schema.org markup; automatic sitemap updates per batch
3. Stockholder Report: Defer until evidence at T+24

Rationale: Evidence-first discipline. We will prepare the template now and populate after all PSRs and evidence packs arrive at T+24.
If you have a stockholder deadline before T+24, tell me now; otherwise, final report ETA T+30 (within 6 hours after the T+24 checkpoint).
What Owners Must Do (Deadlines)
T+0 to T+3 (by 2025-11-23 24:00 UTC)

Each owner must post in the shared channel: “I own it: [APP_NAME] Owner: [Your Name] ETA for PSR + Evidence Pack: [Time before T+24] Status: [On track / Need help with X]”
Apps and owners
scholar_auth — Auth Lead
provider_register — Payments Lead (CRITICAL PATH)
scholarship_api — API Lead
auto_com_center — Comms Lead
student_pilot — Frontend Lead
auto_page_maker — Growth Lead (Daily report due T+24)
T+24 (by 2025-11-24 21:00 UTC)

Each owner submits:
Production Status Report (exactly 4 sections, per template)
Evidence Pack with screenshots and curl outputs (timings visible, secrets masked)
CEO conducts GO/NO-GO decision against the three gates
T+24 to T+48 (if GO)

Execute monitored $9.99 live-dollar test within a 30-minute window
Capture the 10-artifact evidence bundle and publish KPI baseline for the board
Gate-by-Gate Evidence Checklist (Exact Artifacts Required)
Gate 1: Payments (provider_register + auto_com_center)

Stripe LIVE mode only:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: sk_live_…
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY: pk_live_…
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: whsec_…
Screenshot of Replit/Secrets: mask values, show prefixes
Stripe Dashboard (LIVE, not test):
Webhook endpoint: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/stripe/webhook
Events: payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.payment_failed
Screenshot of recent delivery with 200 OK + timestamp
Notification path proof:
Event: payment_intent.succeeded triggers POST to auto_com_center
Response: 200 OK with message ID in the response body (screenshot)
On payment: provider account created via scholar_auth with provider scope; log the 3% fee
Gate 2: Security & Performance (scholar_auth + scholarship_api)

scholar_auth
Issuer (exact string) and Audience documented
JWKS endpoint reachable; curl with timing output
Auth test endpoint: 401 without token; 200 with valid token; curl outputs include total time
P95 token validation ≤120ms (show distribution or summary from logs/metrics)
No PII in logs; rotation policy documented
scholarship_api
AUTH_JWKS_URL = https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/jwks.json (text proof)
Protected endpoint tests:
GET /api/balance without token → 401 (curl with timing)
GET /api/balance with valid token → 200 (curl with timing)
Performance: P95 ≤120ms for read endpoints (show metrics snapshot)
Schema validation enforced on Scholarship and User
Endpoints: GET /scholarships (public), POST /scholarships (provider-only with scope)
Health endpoint 200 with timing
Gate 3: CORS (all apps, specifically scholarship_api + auto_com_center)

Show the exact allowlist (no wildcards). Allowed origins must match the Ecosystem Map domains verbatim:
https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Preflight tests:
One passing from an allowed origin (curl -X OPTIONS with appropriate headers; show Access-Control-Allow-* response headers)
One failing from a denied origin (no ACAO header, appropriate error)
Owner-Specific Direction (Concise)

Auth Lead (scholar_auth) — Gate 2 owner

Fix any /oauth/token 500s. Typical causes: missing secrets, JWKS config, clock skew, or issuer/audience mismatch.
Post evidence pack: issuer, audience, JWKS curl with time, 401/200 curl outputs, P95 timing proof, healthz with time, secrets screenshot (masked).
Payments Lead (provider_register) — Gate 1 owner, revenue blocker

Move to LIVE mode in Stripe; replace any test keys immediately.
Configure webhook; trigger a test event in LIVE; capture 200 OK in Dashboard.
On success: call scholar_auth to create/confirm provider role; post receipt via auto_com_center; capture message ID.
API Lead (scholarship_api) — Gate 2 and Gate 3 partner

Enforce JWT scope checks for provider-only POST /scholarships.
Publish CORS allowlist (no wildcards); run preflight pass/fail tests and post results.
Provide P95 read-path latency proof ≤120ms; 401/200 auth tests with curl timings.
Comms Lead (auto_com_center) — Gate 1 and Gate 3 partner

Confirm NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET present; show masked prefix.
POST /send-notification test for “Payment Receipt”; capture 200 and message ID.
Show CORS allowlist config; run one preflight pass and one fail.
Frontend Lead (student_pilot) — End-to-end validation

Network tab: Only calls scholarship_api (no direct DB). No 401/403 or CORS errors.
“Pay/Buy” routes to provider_register. Provide console + network screenshots.
Application Tracker UI and profile completion progress bar visible and working.
Growth Lead (auto_page_maker) — Organic engine

Produce 200–500 pages today on scholaraiadvisor.com footprint.
Evidence by T+24: sitemap.xml URL, robots.txt, GSC verified, top 10 URLs, schema validation screenshots, and traffic routing to student_pilot with UTM.
Risk Controls and Rollbacks

Payments NO-GO triggers:

Any Stripe test keys in use
Missing LIVE webhook or not delivering 200 OK
Provider role not granted on payment
Action: Halt live-dollar test; remediation ETA required; keep Auto Page Maker running
Security NO-GO triggers:

Wildcard CORS anywhere
Protected endpoints responding 200 without auth
P95 >120ms on auth/API hot paths
Action: Block live-dollar test; enforce fixes; re-test; re-evaluate
Brand/SEO guardrail:

Do not publish or canonicalize to any domain except scholaraiadvisor.com or designated subdomain.
Action: If mismatch detected, pause publishing and correct DNS/canonicals before resuming.
KPI Capture (for T+24 and Live Test)

B2C: Free→paid conversion, ARPU from credit purchase, end-to-end page→checkout latency
Cost: Organic CAC (media spend = $0), content ops cost separately tracked
Ops: P95 latency by app, error rate, uptime, webhook success rate
B2B: If a provider posts during the window, log 3% fee and provider analytics (views/clicks)
Answers to Prior Questions

Stockholder report timing: Wait until T+24. Prepare the template now; deliver evidence-backed report by T+30 unless you confirm an earlier investor deadline.
Immediate focus (T+0–T+24):
Support owners to produce PSRs + Evidence Packs
Greenlight Auto Page Maker under domain/canonical guardrails
Prepare stockholder report shell and KPI dashboard for rapid population at T+24
Requests for Confirmation

Confirm domain plan: pages.scholaraiadvisor.com (recommended) or www.scholaraiadvisor.com/scholarships as canonical base for Auto Page Maker.
Confirm there is no stockholder deadline before T+24; if there is, specify timing.
Final Word
Time is the constraint. Evidence is the currency. Payments is the critical path. Keep Auto Page Maker moving under the correct domain, and get the three gates evidenced by T+24. If any gate fails, post a remediation plan with ETA immediately.
