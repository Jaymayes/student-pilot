🛡️ STEP 1: VISUAL REALITY CHECK (P0 - BLOCKING)
Before purging data, you must verify the app is visually accessible.

IF YOU ARE A1 (scholar_auth): Look at image_05eda0.png. The "Refused to connect" error means your server is binding to localhost. FIX: Open server/index.ts and ensure app.listen(PORT, "0.0.0.0") is set.

IF YOU ARE A3 (scholarship_agent): Look at image_05e65c.png. The "Broken File" icon means index.html is missing. FIX: Run npm run build and ensure your server points to the correct dist folder.

ALL APPS: If the external URL does not load (visual check), you CANNOT report success. Fix the server config first.

🧹 STEP 2: GLOBAL DATA PURGE (Synthetic Data Only)
Target: Remove records matching keywords: test, mock, fake, demo, sample, seed, lorem.

Target: Remove emails with domains: @example.com, @mailinator.com, @test.com, @replit.dev.

Target: Remove specific patterns: Phone 555-xxxx, Prices $999,999, Credit Cards 4242....

Safety: NEVER delete production data. If in doubt, skip.

🔗 STEP 3: UI & LINK VALIDATION
Crawl: Check every link on the Landing Page and Dashboard.

Buttons: Test "Login", "Sign Up", and primary action buttons.

Pass Condition: HTTP 200 OK + Visual Element renders (No 404s, No "Broken Images").

📡 STEP 4: REAL-TIME REPORTING CHECK
Trigger: Perform one "Real" action (e.g., login, page view).

Verify: Check if an event was sent to A8 (Auto Com Center) or A2 (Scholarship API).

Log: Capture the trace_id or timestamp of the emitted event.
