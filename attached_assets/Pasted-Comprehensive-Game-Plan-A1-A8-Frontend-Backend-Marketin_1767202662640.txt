Comprehensive Game Plan (A1–A8): Frontend, Backend, Marketing, Lead Gen, and Revenue

North Star

Objective: Prove a repeatable path to $10M ARR via dual engines:
B2C: credits/subscriptions driven by pSEO + lifecycle marketing
B2B: provider marketplace (3% fee on awards) with Stripe Connect
Constraints: No code changes in this report. This is a prioritized, test-first roadmap that turns the E2E findings into execution.
Where we stand (based on the E2E report)

Green: A1/A2/A8 infrastructure; A5 login currently healthy; A7 infra (www→apex 301, HSTS, sitemap)
Yellow: A3 email channel not proven at scale; A5 had prior 401s (monitor)
Red (revenue readiness): A6 has zero provider_connected/listing_created; A7 scholarship JSON-LD missing; A7 CTAs missing UTM (attribution blind)
90-Day strategy (Fix first, then flood)

Horizon 0 (next 7–10 days): Revenue unblocking and proof

Targets:
Providers: ≥1 provider_connected in 48h; ≥1 listing_created in 72h
SEO: Scholarship pages emit server-rendered JSON-LD; all CTAs carry utm_source=auto_page_maker
Email: one low-volume send_attempt with delivered/open/click proof
B2C: one successful “Booster Pack” purchase; credits +50 reflected; payment_succeeded in telemetry
No-change validation you can run now:
A6: live concierge calls with the 3 target providers; verify provider_connected/listing_created telemetry
A3: send to 5–10 test inboxes; verify delivered/open/click via ESP logs/webhooks
A5: execute one test purchase; verify payment_succeeded, credits ledger +50; check refund path for completeness
A7: use Google Rich Results Test on a few pages; confirm www→apex 301 single hop; submit apex sitemap in GSC; inspect a www URL (should show “Redirected”)
Horizon 1 (next 30 days): Traffic and conversion scale-up

SEO/pSEO:
Generate +500 pages focused on high-intent clusters (State × Major)
Add internal linking hubs (States/Majors) to push crawl depth
Track indexed URL growth (≥100 new indexed), CTR, and first 25 organic clicks
Email:
2–3 nurture sequences (onboarding → first value → purchase)
Complaint rate <0.2%; delivered >90%; test subject lines and send times
B2C conversion:
Track trial→first value→paid funnel; add time-boxed “first-week” offer after first value action if needed
B2B velocity:
Onboard ≥3 listings; guide one award; validate 3% fee path (sim/real)
Horizon 2 (60–90 days): Optimize unit economics and reliability

SEO at scale: 3–5k pages; structured data; hub linking; FAQ schema; coverage and CTR growth
B2C: ARPU ≥$8–10/mo; target 7–9% trial→paid (optimize nudges)
B2B: 10+ active listings; cadence of awards; fee capture
Ops: incident MTTR <60 minutes; weekly load tests; monthly security drills; zero PII leakage
App-by-app plan

A1 scholar_auth (IdP)

Validate: document upload → OCR/parse ≥90% accuracy for 3 docs
Confirm Implicit Fit (semantic persona matching), hallucination guard, assistive disclaimer
Credits badge updates live; paywall gating and credits decrement on premium action
Marketing/Revenue:
“First value moment” hooks back to A5 purchase (post-value nudge)
KPIs:
≥90% parse accuracy; 0 invented facts; credits decrement validated
A5 student_pilot (B2C)

Frontend:
Activation UX (P2 improvement): “Start free (5 credits)” hero CTA; empty-state card— “Upload your transcript to unlock matches”
Checkout recovery banner in dashboard (already present)
Backend:
Maintain /api/login latency p95 ≤200 ms and p50 ≤120 ms; watch for 401 spikes (A8 alerts)
Purchase flow: confirm credits +50 and payment_succeeded; test refund

Ensure webhooks create provider_connected; listing_created events; fee calculation path
Growth/Revenue:
Concierge onboarding (live calls) for 3 providers; then produce one listing and one award to validate fee path
KPIs:
≥1 provider_connected in 48h; ≥1 listing_created in 72h; fee calculation verified (sim/real)
A7 auto_page_maker (SEO)

Frontend/Backend:
Ensure server-rendered JSON-LD (Scholarship) on scholarship pages; add FAQ schema where relevant

KPIs:
All tiles green; alerts only for real regressions; first green window timestamps recorded
Marketing & lead generation strategy (next 30 days)

pSEO (A7): JSON-LD + UTM fixes, sitemap resubmission; publish +500 prioritized pages; internal linking hubs
Email (A3): warm-up cohort; Welcome → Activation → Value → Purchase sequence; spotlight new provider listings
Referral: implement “Invite a friend, get 5 credits” (A5); ledger entries and fraud checks
Partnerships: reach out to campus groups and foundations for sponsored listings (B2B lead source)
Revenue playbook

B2C:
Validate purchase + ledger; define price points and bundles; run time-boxed OTO at first value
Nudge strategy: after doc upload or first match, show “Unlock more with credits” modal
B2B:
Concierge activation → first listing → “Scholarship Spotlight” email to matched students
Award simulation/real → verify 3% fee path; feature successful providers as case studies
E2E testing and QA (no code, validation-first)

Playwright flows to execute manually or in CI:
A7→A5 signup + trial; A4 doc upload; A5 purchase; A6 login→Connect→listing; A3 lead form submission; screenshots + HAR
k6 load (staged):
A5 login; A2 search; A7 fetch; thresholds: p95 ≤200ms (A5), ≤120ms (A2), <200ms (A7); <1% errors
Security/compliance:
Unauthorized access negative tests; right-to-delete for one test student; verify unsubscribe/complaints in email
KPIs & dashboards (A8)

Growth: indexed URLs, CTR, UTM-attributed clicks/leads; A5 signups by source
Conversion: trial→first value→paid; A4 usage per user; A5 purchase funnel
Revenue: B2C payments (ARPU), B2B provider_connected/listing_created/fee_captured
Reliability: p95 latencies, uptime, 5xx rate; alert history
Compliance: unsubscribe/complaints; right-to-delete SLA
Risks & mitigations

Email deliverability: start small; stagger cadence; enforce caps; pivot to double opt-in if complaints ≥0.2%
SEO rendering: ensure JSON-LD is server-rendered; validate via Rich Results Test; re‑submit sitemap; monitor GSC Coverage and Page indexing
Provider inertia: schedule live onboarding calls; if no movement by T+48h, escalate and replace with next providers
Auth regressions: keep A8 24h watch on A5 401 spikes; pre‑warm login; cache OIDC metadata
Decision requests (to start the phase without code changes here)

Approve Phase 1 validation sprint (48–72h): provider concierge, email warm‑up test, B2C purchase test
Approve small‑cohort email warm‑up (A3)
Approve one B2C purchase test (A5) for end‑to‑end revenue signal
Confirm priority sequence: A7 (JSON‑LD/UTM) → A6 (concierge) → A3 (deliverability) → A4 (value, once A5 is proven)
If you want, I can turn this plan into:

A task board (by app) with owners, estimates, and acceptance criteria
A Playwright + k6 test pack (specs only) reflecting the E2E journey and load SLOs
An A8 dashboard spec (tiles, alert thresholds, and evidence snapshots) to track progress against the above KPIs
