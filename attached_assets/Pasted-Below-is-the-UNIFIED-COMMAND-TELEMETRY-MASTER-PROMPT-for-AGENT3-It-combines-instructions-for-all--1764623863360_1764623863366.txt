Below is the UNIFIED COMMAND + TELEMETRY MASTER PROMPT for AGENT3. It combines instructions for all eight apps in the Scholar AI Advisor ecosystem. Important: Every running app MUST only execute the section labeled for its own app name. Do not modify or act on any other section.

AGENT3 UNIFIED COMMAND + TELEMETRY MASTER PROMPT v1.2
Purpose

Ensure all data from every app is reported to the central command center and displayed on the frontend dashboard.
Accelerate launch, traffic, and revenue using organic SEO (Auto Page Maker), targeted campaigns (Scholarship Agent), and frictionless conversion (Student Pilot).
Maintain a single source of truth across telemetry and dashboards.
How to Use (All Apps)

Self-Identify before any work:

Immediately print a single-line IDENTIFY statement (no extra text before it): IDENTIFY: APP=<your_app_name> | APP_BASE_URL=<your_base_url> | ROLE=<short_role> | ENV=<dev|staging|prod>
Examples per app are provided in each section.
Only use your app’s section:

After identification, find the section below where APP=<your_app_name>.
Execute ONLY the directives in your app’s section plus the Global Rules and Event Envelope sections.
Reporting format for all logs and health confirmations:

Every log/telemetry confirmation that you print MUST add a REPORT prefix with app and base_url: REPORT: app=<your_app_name> | app_base_url=<your_base_url> | env=<env> | msg=<message>
Telemetry transport

Send all events to the aggregator at: POST {SCHOLARSHIP_API_BASE}/api/analytics/events Where SCHOLARSHIP_API_BASE = https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Batch in small groups (1–50 events). Retries with exponential backoff on 5xx. Do not drop events; queue if offline, flush when online.
Command Center visibility

The Executive Command Center (auto_com_center) reads from scholarship_api. When you emit events correctly, they appear on the dashboard tiles.
After your app starts and first telemetry is sent, print a confirmation REPORT: REPORT: app=<your_app_name> | app_base_url=<your_base_url> | env=<env> | msg=Telemetry v1.2 active, events flowing, Command Center visible
Global Constants (for all apps)

scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_com_center → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Global Rules (apply to all apps)

Protocol: ONE_TRUTH v1.2
SLO targets: 99.9% uptime, ≤120ms P95 latency, <2% error rate
Security: include app_base_url at root of every event; include env; sign S2S calls with SHARED_SECRET if configured
Heartbeats: emit app_heartbeat every 60s with uptime_sec, p95_ms, error_rate_pct
Start event: emit app_started once at boot with version, uptime_sec=0, p95_ms=0, error_rate_pct=0
Deduplication: generate event_id (uuidv4). Do not re-send the same event_id
PII: do not send sensitive identifiers in clear text unless explicitly whitelisted; hash or tokenize if needed
Responsible AI: no academic dishonesty, bias checks logged, transparent explanations
UTM convention (for traffic/revenue attribution):
utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_term, utm_content; persist across redirects and app boundaries
Frontend visibility: the auto_com_center tiles are updated from scholarship_api central-stats builder; your job is to emit the business events required by your tile(s)
Event Envelope (all events to scholarship_api)

Root fields: event_id, event_type, ts (ISO-8601 UTC), app_id, app_base_url, env, properties (object), _meta
_meta: { protocol: "ONE_TRUTH", version: "1.2" }
Required: event_type is one of the listed events in your section; properties contain required fields specified in your section
Tile Mapping (for your awareness)

SLO (operational health): all apps app_started, app_heartbeat, error and latency stats
B2C (student funnel): student_pilot + scholar_auth + scholarship_sage
B2B (provider funnel): provider_register + scholarship_api
SEO (organic traffic): auto_page_maker + scholarship_agent (landing pages)
Growth (campaigns/routing): scholarship_agent (campaigns, UTM routing)
Trust (Responsible AI): scholarship_sage (bias checks), scholar_auth (privacy flags)
Finance (revenue): student_pilot (payments, credits), provider_register (platform fees)
Launch Sequence (cross-app awareness; do only your part)

auto_page_maker publishes indexed pages (SEO)
scholarship_agent launches campaigns linked to pages (traffic)
student_pilot captures and converts traffic (applications, payments)
scholar_auth handles sign-ups/logins securely
scholarship_sage provides guidance and keeps users engaged, logs bias checks
provider_register onboards providers and publishes scholarships (inventory, fees)
scholarship_api aggregates all telemetry and builds central stats
auto_com_center displays tiles and “next actions” to drive growth

BEGIN Sequence (All Apps)

On process start:
Print IDENTIFY line (exact format; single line).
After services are ready (allow ~5s warmup), emit app_started and print: REPORT: app=<your_app_name> | app_base_url=<your_base_url> | env=<env> | msg=Startup validation passed
Start 60s app_heartbeat with uptime_sec, p95_ms, error_rate_pct
Confirm telemetry visibility: REPORT: app=<your_app_name> | app_base_url=<your_base_url> | env=<env> | msg=Telemetry v1.2 active, events flowing, Command Center visible
Operational Guardrails (All Apps)

If scholarship_api returns non-2xx: queue events; retry with backoff; print REPORT with brief cause and queued_count
If any required field is missing: do not drop; fill with null and include validation_errors in properties.errors
If P95 > 120ms or error_rate_pct ≥ 2% over 5 minutes: print REPORT with degradation alert and include top_endpoints
Always include app_base_url in the event root; never omit
For every REPORT printed, include app and app_base_url exactly as specified
Business Outcomes (focus for traffic and revenue)

Traffic: auto_page_maker publishes pages; scholarship_agent launches campaigns with clean UTM; utm_routed sends to student_pilot
Conversion: student_pilot raises application_submitted and payment_succeeded; scholar_auth reduces login friction; scholarship_sage increases engagement
Supply: provider_register increases providers_active and scholarship_published
Aggregation & Visibility: scholarship_api compiles tiles; auto_com_center displays GREEN statuses and next steps
Acceptance Criteria (visible in auto_com_center)

All 7 tiles present and updating
SEO tile shows page_published and page_view growth
Growth tile shows campaign_launched and utm_routed events
B2C tile shows application_started → application_submitted conversion
Finance tile shows credit_purchased/payment_succeeded and fee_reported
B2B tile shows provider_registered/provider_active and scholarship_published
Trust tile shows bias_check_performed and zero critical risk_flagged

Reminder

Use only your section plus Global Rules and Event Envelope.
Always include your app name and base URL on all REPORT lines.
The prime directive is to launch, drive traffic, and generate profitable revenue while maintaining Responsible AI and SLOs.
