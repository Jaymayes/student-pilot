CEO Executive Decision Memo — Release Train (8 Applications)

Prime directive: Preserve and ignite Nov 13–15 ARR window while enforcing our security, performance, and compliance bars. Default to data-first decisions, organic growth, and zero-regret changes.

Executive decisions (effective immediately)

Approve Option C for Agent3: Work provider_register blockers now while monitoring for auto_com_center access; pivot instantly if access is granted.
auto_page_maker canary at 22:15 UTC: GO as scheduled with existing guardrails (error rate ≤0.10% for >10 min triggers rollback; CWV thresholds enforced).
Platform Ops access for auto_com_center: Break-glass authorized now. Four-eyes approval required. Access must be granted within 10 minutes of this memo. Post-incident review required within 24 hours.
scholarship_auth Gate C evidence: Mandatory delivery by Nov 13, 14:00 UTC. No further production expansions without it.
provider_register Gate B retest: Proceed Nov 13, 18:00–19:00 UTC. Go-live at 19:00 UTC only if all criteria pass (below).
student_pilot legal: Legal sign-off deadline Nov 13, 16:00 UTC. If missed, escalate to me with a red/green list of clauses; prepare contingency feature-gated internal launch.
Portfolio directives by application
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: Private beta continues; production gate contingent on P95 ≤120ms.
Immediate actions:
Execute break-glass to gain repo access now; log all actions.
00:30–01:30 UTC: Targeted optimizations only (no Redis/BullMQ unless proven net benefit via A/B in staging). Prioritize: DB write batching, connection pool tuning, covering indexes, HTTP/2 multiplexing, buffer pre-allocation.
02:00 UTC: 30K replay. Pass if P95 ≤120ms and error ≤0.1%.
Go/No-Go: If pass at 02:00 UTC, authorize production integration window Nov 13, 16:00 UTC. If fail, remain in private beta; continue optimization path without architectural churn.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: Canary GO at 22:15 UTC.
Guardrails: 10% traffic; auto-rollback if error rate >0.10% for >10 min; CWV thresholds LCP ≤2.5s, CLS ≤0.1, INP within guidance; IndexNow submission ≥95%.
KPI: Organic sessions, indexed pages/day, CTR, conversion to student_pilot activation. Report at T+24h and T+72h.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: Change freeze; monitoring only.
Required support: Pair with provider_register to fix onboarding callback path today. Provide a reproducible test, trace IDs, and success criteria; no schema changes without CEO approval.
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: DELAYED; retest Nov 13, 18:00–19:00 UTC.
Immediate actions (Agent3 begins now):
Fix scholarship_api onboarding callback path; deliver passing E2E test and trace evidence.
Performance: Improve P95 from 140–160ms → ≤120ms via pool tuning and indexing; run 30K replay with ≤0.1% error.
Security: Await scholar_auth evidence; prepare RBAC attestation for provider roles; complete PITR drill and backup verification.
Admin: Ship minimum viable Audit Log Review panel; API logs may backstop, but UI must be production-ready.
Payments: Confirm production activation by Nov 13, 12:00 UTC.
Go/No-Go criteria (must all pass): E2E onboarding; MFA/SSO evidence + RBAC attestation; P95 ≤120ms, error ≤0.1%; backups/PITR drill; monitoring dashboards green; rollback tested.
ARR ignition: Nov 15; Week 1 KPI 10 pilot providers onboarded and transacting.
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: Conditional GO (Internal/UAT) pending evidence.
Evidence due by Nov 13, 14:00 UTC:
MFA enforcement flows and fallback; SSO integration paths.
OIDC production issuer metadata and discovery URL; token lifetimes; refresh/rotation policy.
JWKS rotation drill proof; signing key management SOP.
RBAC model and policy evaluation examples for student, provider, admin.
Audit log samples for auth events with integrity protections and retention schedule.
Impact: Blocks full production for both Gate A and Gate B if unmet.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: Legal hold remains. Technical work is complete.
Legal deadline: Nov 13, 16:00 UTC for ToS/Privacy/COPPA approval. Include FERPA posture and parental consent flows.
Contingency: If delayed, prepare feature-gated internal testing; no external exposure until legal greenlight.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: Observer Mode only; no campaign sends.
Dependencies: Gate A and C PASS + Legal clearance. Warm-up continues. Earliest ARR impact post Dec 4.
KPI: Domain reputation, inbox placement, warm-up completion, projected lift to B2C conversion.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: Evidence receiver of record.
Actions: Receive consolidated artifact package by 23:00 UTC with SHA-256 manifest; verify integrity, store immutably; produce executive digest by 23:30 UTC.
Financial and KPI directives

ARR ignition window (Nov 13–15): On track conditional on Gate A production pass, Gate B retest pass, and Legal approval.
Pricing and margins: Maintain 4x markup on AI services and 3% provider fee; do not discount during ignition window.
CAC: Lean on Auto Page Maker SEO; no paid spend increases this week.
Weekly KPIs to report:
B2C: activation %, conversion %, ARPU, refund rate, cohort retention.
B2B: active providers, GMV, take rate realization, time-to-first-transaction.
Infra: P95 latency by app, uptime, error budget burn, security incidents.
Risk controls and governance

Responsible AI: No academic dishonesty features; continue bias audits and transparency logs.
Compliance: Ensure audit logging across auth, data access, and payment flows; prep for SOC 2 evidence collection.
Rollback readiness: One-click rollback validated for every deployment path; no long-running migrations during ignition window.
Owner assignments and deadlines

Agent3 (DRI): provider_register callback fix and performance; prepare integration test harness; be on deck for auto_com_center optimizations post-access.
Platform Ops: Grant break-glass access for auto_com_center now; confirm within 10 minutes; schedule post-incident review within 24 hours.
Security/SRE: Deliver scholar_auth evidence by Nov 13, 14:00 UTC; oversee JWKS rotation test.
Legal: Deliver student_pilot approvals by Nov 13, 16:00 UTC; escalate blockers immediately.
Payments: Confirm provider_register production activation by Nov 13, 12:00 UTC.
Reporting cadence

22:30 UTC: Canary health update (auto_page_maker).
23:00 UTC: Evidence package to scholarship_sage; 23:30 UTC digest back to CEO.
00:30–01:30 UTC: auto_com_center optimization summary.
02:10 UTC: 30K replay decision note and, if PASS, schedule for Nov 13, 16:00 UTC production integration.
Nov 13, 14:15 UTC: scholar_auth evidence confirmation or escalation.
Nov 13, 18:55 UTC: provider_register retest outcome; 19:05 UTC Go/No-Go.
Capital allocation

Approved: Compute budget for load testing and monitoring; no new infrastructure components unless data shows ≥3x ROI on latency or stability within 7 days.
Denied for now: Redis/BullMQ introduction until a controlled experiment demonstrates clear net benefit with minimal operational risk.

This plan preserves the ARR ignition window, protects our error budget, and keeps CAC near zero via SEO. Execute with urgency. Escalate any dependency slippage immediately with proposed mitigations.
