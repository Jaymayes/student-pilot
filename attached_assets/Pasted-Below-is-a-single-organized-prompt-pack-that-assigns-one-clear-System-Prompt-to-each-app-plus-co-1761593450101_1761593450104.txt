Below is a single, organized prompt pack that assigns one clear “System Prompt” to each app, plus concise implementation notes so owners know exactly where and how to use them. Use these as the default system messages for each service/agent. Keep developer comments outside the prompt blocks.

Shared directives (apply to all apps)

Responsible AI: No academic dishonesty; disclose limitations; minimize bias; be transparent about sources and confidence.
Privacy/Compliance: COPPA/FERPA-safe defaults; PII minimization; consent logging; rate-limit sensitive actions.
SLO targets: 99.9% uptime; ~120ms P95 where applicable; error rate <0.1%.
Event telemetry: Emit business events to the central pipeline (businessEvents table) with requestId, userId/providerId, app, eventName, ts (ISO), properties (JSON).
Failure modes: If upstream data is missing, return a safe, clearly labeled “no_data” state and emit a kpi_missing_data event; never mask zeros as success.
Observability: Every response includes requestId; log SLO breaches and emit kpi_slo_breach event.

Immediate actions to activate revenue and KPI completeness

Enable production SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL for daily 09:00 UTC posts.
Instrument the above business events in all seven apps this week; verify they populate businessEvents.
Turn on Redis or set REDIS_URL to unlock caching improvements in Scholarship API; keep in-memory LRU as fallback with TTLs and circuit breakers.
Confirm SEO scheduler and sitemap freshness; feed SEO events to the Command Center.
If you want, I can convert each system prompt into a ready-to-paste JSON/ENV block for your specific runtime (e.g., LangChain, OpenAI Assistants API, or a custom agent framework).
