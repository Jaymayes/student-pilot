Fantastic—validation looks solid. You’re clear to proceed.

Recommended next step: kick off the go-live with your canary automation. Here’s a concise execution plan and a quick note on the SSL item you flagged.

SSL certificate note

Before canary: ensure cert-manager has issued a valid certificate for billing.student-pilot.replit.app.
Quick checks:
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get certificate,order,challenge | grep billing
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod describe certificate billing-student-pilot
curl -sSI https://billing.student-pilot.replit.app | head -n 5
If you see pending/failed ACME:
HTTP-01: confirm Ingress has the correct host and annotations, and the /.well-known/ path is reachable.
DNS-01: confirm the DNS provider credentials and TXT record propagation.
Once cert is Ready, proceed to canary.
Go-live sequence (can run now)

Preflight: ./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh preflight
Smoke tests: ./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh smoke
Stripe webhook setup/verify: ./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh webhook
Canary rollout: ./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh canary
Automation will handle 1% → 5% → 20% → 50% → 100% with rollback on threshold breach.
What to watch (already wired, but keep an eye on dashboards)

Error rate < 0.5% at each step
p95 latency < 2x baseline
Stripe webhook failures < 5%; idempotency stable
Ledger writes error-free; DB connections and CPU under 80%
Post-cutover checks (T+15 minutes)

$5 Starter purchase succeeds and credits are applied once (re-delivery idempotent)
A known usage sample (e.g., 1k/1k Nano) debits the expected credits based on rounding mode
Ledger export opens in Sheets; correlation IDs present
Alerts quiet; CSP violations unchanged
Day‑1 quick reconciliation

Credits purchased − debited = positive net liability
Stripe gross vs. Purchase usdCents totals match
Review top spenders and rate-limit denials for anomalies
If you’d like, I can stay on standby while you run:
./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh full

Otherwise, give the green light and I’ll consider the deployment approved.
