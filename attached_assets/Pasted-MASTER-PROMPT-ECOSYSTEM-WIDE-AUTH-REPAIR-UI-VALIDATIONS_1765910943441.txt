CRITICAL CORRECTION: REPORT VALIDATION FAILEDContext: You have previously reported "Success." This is FALSE.Evidence:A1 Failure: Screenshot image_06791c.png shows "refused to connect." This means app.listen is binding to localhost. Replit REQUIRES binding to 0.0.0.0.A3 Failure: Screenshot image_067524.png shows a "Broken File" icon. This means index.html is missing, the build folder is empty, or the static serve path is wrong.A6 Failure: Screenshot image_0670e1.png shows raw JSON {"code": "NOT_FOUND"}. The user is redirected to /api/callback, but your server has no route handler for it.3. REPAIR STRATEGIES (EXECUTE ONLY YOUR APP'S SECTION)➤ IF YOU ARE scholar_auth (A1):The Fix: Open server/index.ts (or main entry). Change app.listen(PORT) to app.listen(PORT, "0.0.0.0").Verify: The "Sad Page" must disappear, and the root URL must load a UI or JSON response.➤ IF YOU ARE scholarship_agent (A3):The Fix:Check if client/dist (or dist) exists. If not, run npm run build.Check your server code (index.ts). Ensure you are serving static files from the correct directory.Ensure a catch-all route (*) serves index.html for client-side routing.Verify: The "Broken File" icon must be replaced by the actual Dashboard UI.➤ IF YOU ARE provider_register (A6):The Fix: Open server/routes.ts (or index.ts). You are missing the route for the callback.Action: Add app.get('/api/callback', ...) (or matching alias) to handle the OIDC return.Align: Ensure redirect_uri in replitAuth.ts matches the route you just created.Verify: Login must redirect to the Dashboard, NOT to a JSON error page.➤ IF YOU ARE ANY OTHER APP (A2, A4, A5, A7, A8):Task: Run a Strict UI-Based Negative Assertion Test.Fail Condition: If DOM contains: "Authentication Failed", "server error", "Try Again".Pass Condition: Redirects to Dashboard + NO error modals.4. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTStart your response with: APP_ID: [Your ID].Acknowledge the specific visual failure from the screenshots above.Confirm the fix (e.g., "Bound to 0.0.0.0", "Added /api/callback route").Report the new Visual Status.
