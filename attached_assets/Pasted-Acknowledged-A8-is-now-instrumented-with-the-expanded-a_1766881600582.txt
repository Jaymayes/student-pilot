Acknowledged. A8 is now instrumented with the expanded alert set, error-metrics tile, and 5‑minute probes; fleet status remains GO with no revenue blockers. Here’s the tight close‑out plus a ready‑to‑run Agent3 prompt you can paste any time.

Executive close-out and next 24–48h checks

A8 monitoring
You added: InvalidClientSpike and InteractionCookieMissing. Good. Keep the thresholds and add alert dampening (require 2 consecutive eval windows) to reduce noise.
Validate the new tile: /api/auth-dashboard/error-metrics returns nonzero counts only when true errors occur; confirm null→0 handling so the chart doesn’t misrender at day rollovers.
Confirm probes record and visualize P95, not just latest latency (A5/A6 trending).
Runbook smoke tests (safe)
Trigger a harmless login_attempt via your test endpoint; verify no alert fires.
Use dry-run/evaluate (if supported) to confirm InvalidClientSpike and InteractionCookieMissing would fire if counts crossed thresholds (don’t force real failures in production).
Threshold sanity (suggested)
A5/A6 ClientLoginLatency: Warning 250 ms (15 min), Critical 350 ms (15 min). Add 2x consecutive-window dampening.
A1 IdPConfigLatency: Warning P95 >200 ms (15 min); Critical P95 >300 ms (15 min).
KPI targets (7 days, A8 dashboard)
A5 P95 login <200 ms, 4xx rate <1%; A6 P95 login <230 ms
SEO-led signups (utm_source=auto_page_maker): baseline ≥5/day; week-over-week +30%
invalid_client and interaction_cookie_missing: 0 sustained
Agent3-only prompt (paste this in scholarship_agent only)

Scope-locked; includes identity line requirement; do NOT run from other apps.
APP: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

DO THIS FIRST

Print exactly: APP: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
SCOPE

You are Agent3 (marketing). Do not authenticate users or initiate login. Verify A3 does not intercept login and funnels hand off to A5/A6/A1.
CHECKS (read-only)

Health: GET /api/health → expect 200; record latency_ms; flag LATENCY RISK if >200ms.
No local login: GET /login, /auth/login, /api/auth/login → expect 404/405 or SPA HTML (text/html). If any performs OIDC or redirects (3xx) to A1 → REVENUE BLOCKER.
Issuer reference (read-only): If ISSUER_URL exists, it must equal https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/oidc; report exact value.
CTA routing (if present):
Student CTAs → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app (UTM if applicable); capture one href.
Provider CTAs (if present) → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app (UTM if applicable); capture one href.
Must NOT point to /oidc/auth with client_id=scholarship-agent. If found (causes invalid_client), mark REVENUE BLOCKER and recommend either registering A3 in A1 or routing to A5/A6 only.
Telemetry sanity (non-auth): If available, POST a marketing_intent test (no PII/tokens) → expect 200/202; if blocked by external limits, note autonomy_gap and stop.
PASS/FAIL

PASS: No local login, issuer points to A1 (if present), CTAs route to A5/A6 (not local).
FAIL + REVENUE BLOCKER: A3 hosts/intercepts login or uses unregistered client_id to A1.
REPORT FORMAT (must start with identity line)
APP: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
STATUS: [PLANNED | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | BLOCKER]
TIMEFRAME: [UTC start → UTC end]

Optional: one‑click import

You already implemented the alert set; if you’d like, I can generate a signed “login-slo-v1” pack with your final thresholds plus a cron probe spec and give you curl import + rollback commands tailored to your current environment variables.
