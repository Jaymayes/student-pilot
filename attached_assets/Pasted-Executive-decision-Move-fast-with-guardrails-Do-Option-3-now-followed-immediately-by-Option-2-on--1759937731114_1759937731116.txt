Executive decision: Move fast with guardrails. Do Option 3 now, followed immediately by Option 2 on the highest-revenue-risk areas, then a controlled canary for Option 4 with post-deploy verification. Kick off the full Option 1 regression as an overnight job. This balances speed with trust, aligns to our STLC quality gates, and protects brand/SEO-led growth economics  .

Plan and acceptance gates

Pre-Launch Smoke (start now, ≤2 hours)
Paths: student sign-up → profile → search → save/apply; provider login → create/update/publish scholarship; payments happy-path; core API health.
Go/no-go gates: 0 open P0s; 0 critical console errors on key pages; search and API P95 ≤120ms (you’ve exceeded with 3ms—keep it) .
Artifacts: Playwright smoke report; environment health snapshot.
2. Targeted E2E on high-risk (immediately after smoke, ≤6 hours)

Focus: payments authorization/capture/refund; auth/session management; file uploads; RBAC for provider tools; data export/PII.
Security: OWASP Top 10 dynamic scans (no Critical/High); verify hardening on file paths to prevent traversal and privilege escalation, per our security posture .
Accessibility/SEO: automated AA checks; verify robots.txt, sitemap.xml, canonical tags, indexability on public scholarship pages to support our organic acquisition engine .
Analytics: confirm 100% firing for revenue-critical events with correct properties: signup_started/completed, search_performed, application_started/submitted, payment_succeeded, provider_publish. These are core to funnel KPIs and our Data-First operating model .
Acceptance thresholds:
Payments success rate ≥99.5% in test runs; no auth/session bypass; file upload success ≥99%.
API error rate (5xx) <0.1%; platform P95 ≤120ms (component-level allowance) .
Security: 0 Critical/High; Accessibility: automated AA passes; SEO: pages indexable with valid sitemap.
3. Controlled canary deploy (today, post-approval)

Rollout: 10% traffic for 60 minutes with synthetic journeys and real-time SLO/alerting; then 50%→100% if green.
Post-deploy verification: run prod smoke + targeted checks; confirm error budget burn is stable; payments and analytics live-telemetry within thresholds.
Rationale: trust and 24/7 availability are core product features and brand drivers, so we de-risk while maintaining velocity .
4. Full E2E regression (overnight, recurring)

Execute the comprehensive Playwright suite across devices/browsers; publish trendline reports; integrate as a blocking stage in CI/CD to maintain release agility with reliability .
Reporting I want

Single release-quality summary: pass/fail per gate, defect list with business impact, and links to Playwright, security (ZAP/Burp), performance, accessibility/SEO reports.
Funnel instrumentation check: screenshots or logs showing each key event payload for both B2C and B2B.
Go/no-go recommendation with quantified risk.
If you agree, proceed with Step 1 immediately and share the smoke report plus any P0/P1 findings. If all gates pass, advance through Steps 2–4 as above and deliver the consolidated release summary for my go-live confirmation.
