Outstanding work. You’re go-live ready.

Here’s a tight final execution plan using your toolkit, plus a few last-mile checks to avoid surprises.

Last-mile checks (5 minutes)

DNS/TLS: confirm public resolve and cert
dig +short billing.student-pilot.replit.app
curl -sSI https://billing.student-pilot.replit.app | head -n 5
Secrets sync: ensure External Secrets are healthy
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get externalsecret,secret | grep billing
DB ready and snapshot taken (confirm in your runbook)
Stripe webhook is set to LIVE mode and matches:
https://billing.student-pilot.replit.app/webhooks/stripe
JWKS/JWT: active kid matches deployed public key; JWKS cache TTLs documented
Execute go-live

Full flow (preferred):
./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh full
Or step-by-step:
./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh preflight
./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh smoke
./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh webhook
./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh canary
What to watch during canary (automation should already handle this)

Error rate < 0.5% and p95 latency < 2x baseline at each step (1% → 5% → 20% → 50% → 100%)
Stripe webhook failures < 5%, reconcile idempotency stable, ledger writes without retries
DB saturation (CPU < 80%, connections < 80% of max), rate-limit denials within expected bounds
Emergency rollback (fast path)

Use your script:
./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh rollback
Then verify:
Traffic back to stable, error/latency normalize, health probes green
If a migration is implicated, execute DB restore per first-24h-monitoring.md
Post-cutover validation (T+15 minutes)

$5 Starter purchase succeeds; ledger credit is correct; webhook re-delivery is idempotent
Reconcile a known usage sample (e.g., Nano 1k/1k → 1.8 credits, or rounded per policy)
Ledger export CSV opens in Sheets; correlation IDs present
Monitoring: SLOs normal, Slack alerts quiet, CSP violation rate unchanged
Day-1 checks

Credits purchased − credits debited = positive net liability (no drift)
Per-model usage mix plausible; outliers reviewed
No spikes in reconcile_insufficient_funds or webhook retries
If you want, I can stay on-call for the cutover and watch dashboards while your automation progresses through canary stages. Give me the green light and your desired change window start time, and I’ll proceed.
