Global directives for all apps

Identity first (mandatory): Before any work, print exactly: APP: <app_name> | APP_BASE_URL: <base_url>
Scope discipline: Execute only the section labeled for your app. Ignore all others.
Read‑only verification: Do not change code, secrets, DNS, email/ESP, or infra. If a step needs external credentials or a human action, stop and report as autonomy_gap.
Evidence and timing: For every check, capture status code, critical headers (Location, Set‑Cookie), any error= fields, and response time. Flag >200ms as LATENCY RISK.
Revenue blockers: Any issue that prevents user login, checkout initiation, or Stripe Connect completion must be flagged as REVENUE BLOCKER.
Reporting identity: Every output and the final report must start with: APP: <app_name> | APP_BASE_URL: <base_url>
A1 ONLY — scholar_auth (Identity Provider; backbone for B2C and B2B)
APP: scholar_auth | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Verify OIDC readiness for A5 (B2C) and A6 (B2B). Detect “Session Expired”, “invalid_client”, or interaction cookie issues.
Checks (redirects disabled)

Discovery + JWKS
GET /.well-known/openid-configuration → 200; record authorization_endpoint, token_endpoint; latency_ms.
GET /.well-known/jwks.json → 200; keys[] non‑empty; latency_ms.
Authorize (dry runs; no credentials)
A5: GET /oidc/auth with response_type=code, client_id=student-pilot, redirect_uri=https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/callback, scope=openid email profile, code_challenge_method=S256, code_challenge=<dummy>, state, nonce. Expect 302/303; capture Location and Set‑Cookie (interaction/resume; SameSite=None; Secure; HttpOnly).
A6: same but client_id=provider-register and redirect_uri=https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/auth/callback.
Error capture
error=invalid_client → list client_id; mark REVENUE BLOCKER.
error=server_error “Failed to process interaction” → note if interaction cookie was sent; if missing, classify as cross‑site cookie issue; mark REVENUE BLOCKER.
Pass/Fail

PASS if discovery/JWKS healthy and both dry‑runs redirect correctly with interaction cookies set.
FAIL + REVENUE BLOCKER if PKCE rejected, client_id/redirect_uri invalid, interaction cookies not set, or interaction errors occur.
A5 ONLY — student_pilot (B2C login client)
APP: student_pilot | APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Verify login initiation complies with A1 PKCE/S256 and callback safety.
Checks (redirects disabled)

Login redirect: GET /api/login or /api/auth/login → expect 302/303/307 to A1 /oidc/auth; verify client_id=student-pilot, response_type=code, scope includes openid, code_challenge_method=S256, code_challenge present, redirect_uri=https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/callback.
Callback negative: GET /api/callback?error=access_denied&state=dummy → expect safe 302 to login/home; no 5xx.
Pass/Fail

PASS if PKCE S256 present and callback safe.
FAIL + REVENUE BLOCKER if PKCE missing, wrong client_id/redirect_uri, or callback 5xx.
A6 ONLY — provider_register (B2B login client)
APP: provider_register | APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Verify provider login initiation complies with A1 PKCE/S256 and callback safety.
Checks (redirects disabled)

Login redirect: GET /api/login or /auth/login → expect 302/303/307 to A1 /oidc/auth; verify client_id=provider-register, response_type=code, scope includes openid, code_challenge_method=S256, code_challenge present, redirect_uri=https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/auth/callback.
Callback negative: GET /auth/callback?error=access_denied&state=dummy → expect safe 302; no 5xx.
Pass/Fail

PASS if PKCE S256 present and callback safe.
FAIL + REVENUE BLOCKER if PKCE missing, wrong client_id/redirect_uri, or callback 5xx.
A7 ONLY — auto_page_maker (Funnel to B2C/B2B)
APP: auto_page_maker | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Validate CTAs route to A5/A6 with UTM; A7 must not host or intercept login.
Checks

CTA presence: At least one CTA to A5 with utm_source=auto_page_maker; at least one CTA to A6 with same.
Target reachability: HEAD/GET targets → expect 200 (SPA shell) and 3xx at actual login endpoints.
No local login: /login, /auth/login, /api/auth/login must not be real auth handlers (404/401/SPA shell acceptable).
Pass/Fail

PASS if CTAs + UTM present, targets reachable, no local auth handlers.
FAIL + REVENUE BLOCKER if links missing/incorrect or local login exposed.
A2 ONLY — scholarship_api (Core API; must not host user login)
APP: scholarship_api | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Confirm no login endpoints; protected endpoints reject unauth safely.
Checks

Health: GET /health → 200; latency_ms.
No login endpoints: GET /auth/login and /api/auth/login → 404/401; latency_ms.
Protected endpoint negative: GET a protected endpoint (e.g., /api/v1/credits/balance) without token → 401/403/422; ensure no PII leakage.
Pass/Fail

PASS if health OK, no login endpoints, protected rejection is safe.
FAIL if login exposed or sensitive data leaks.
A4 ONLY — scholarship_sage (Advisor; defers to A1/A5)
APP: scholarship_sage | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Confirm deferral to A1/A5; no broken local login.
Checks

If a login entry exists, GET it (redirects disabled) → expect redirect to A1 /oidc/auth with PKCE S256.
If no login route, mark N/A and verify /login isn’t an auth handler.
Pass/Fail

PASS if defers cleanly or N/A with no local login.
FAIL if local login exists but lacks PKCE or errors.
A8 ONLY — auto_com_center (Telemetry observer; not an auth surface)
APP: auto_com_center | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Validate telemetry readiness to observe login events; no login endpoints.
Checks

Health: GET /healthz or /health → 200; latency_ms.
Ingest: POST a harmless login_attempt test event → 200/202; latency_ms.
No login endpoints: GET /api/auth/login → 404/401.
Pass/Fail

PASS if health OK and ingest accepts test event; no login endpoints.
FAIL if telemetry API unavailable or exposes login.
A3 ONLY — scholarship_agent (Agent3) — STRICT SCOPE AND DETAILED DIRECTIONS
APP: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

You are Agent3. Execute only this section. Do not authenticate users and do not initiate A1/A5/A6 login flows. Your role is to prove A3 marketing does not interfere with login and funnels hand off correctly to A5/A6/A1.

Agent3 steps (perform ONLY these)

Identify first (mandatory)
Print exactly: APP: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
2. Health check

GET /api/health → expect 200; record latency_ms. If >200ms, flag LATENCY RISK.
3. Verify NO local login endpoints

Probe GET /login, /auth/login, /api/auth/login.
Expected: 404/405 OR SPA HTML shell (text/html). Record status + content-type.
If any are real auth handlers (i.e., performing OIDC or returning 3xx to A1), flag REVENUE BLOCKER (A3 must not host login).
4. Issuer reference (read‑only)

If configuration or ENV exposes ISSUER_URL (or equivalent), confirm it points to A1: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/oidc
Report exact value found.
5. CTA routing (if present in UI/templates)

Verify student-facing CTAs (e.g., “Sign Up”, “Get Started”) point to: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app Include UTM when applicable. Capture one sample href.
Verify provider-facing CTAs (if present) point to: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app Include UTM when applicable. Capture one sample href.
Confirm no CTA points to /oidc/auth with client_id=scholarship-agent.
If found and it yields error=invalid_client (matches the on-page “Authorization Error: invalid_client” you may see), mark REVENUE BLOCKER and recommend either: a) Register A3 as an OIDC client in A1, or b) Remove A3 sign-in and route users to A5/A6 exclusively.
6. Telemetry sanity (non‑auth)

If available, POST a benign marketing_intent test event to your telemetry endpoint; expect 200/202; ensure no PII/tokens. If it fails due to external account limits, note autonomy_gap and stop.
Agent3 pass/fail

PASS if A3 exposes no local login, issuer points to A1 (if present), and CTAs route to A5/A6 (never to local auth).
FAIL + REVENUE BLOCKER if A3 exposes or intercepts login, or routes to A1 with an unregistered client_id causing invalid_client.
Mandatory report format (all apps)

Always begin with your identity line:
APP: <app_name> | APP_BASE_URL: <base_url>

Then include:
STATUS: [PLANNED | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | BLOCKER]
TIMEFRAME: [UTC start → UTC end]

ACTIONS TAKEN
[HTTP checks performed; endpoints; key headers; latency_ms]
2. B2C LOGIN (A5) RESULTS

[PASS/FAIL/NA] Summary and evidence (Agent3: NA unless only verifying CTA target)
3. B2B LOGIN (A6) RESULTS

[PASS/FAIL/NA] Summary and evidence (Agent3: NA unless only verifying CTA target)
4. OBSERVATIONS AND EVIDENCE

[critical response codes; Location headers; Set‑Cookie flags; error= fields; timestamps; sample hrefs]
5. ROOT CAUSE AND RISK

[e.g., “invalid_client for client_id=scholarship-agent; A3 must not initiate login”, “latency >200ms on /api/health”]
6. RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP (24–48 HOURS)

[one high‑ROI next action; owner app; e.g., “A1: register A3 or route A3 Sign In to A5/A6 only”]
