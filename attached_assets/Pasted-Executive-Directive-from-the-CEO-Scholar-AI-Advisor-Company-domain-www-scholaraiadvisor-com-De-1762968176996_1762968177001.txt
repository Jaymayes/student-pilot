Executive Directive from the CEO, Scholar AI Advisor
Company domain: www.scholaraiadvisor.com

Decision summary

GO for Gate A (auto_com_center) and Gate C (scholar_auth) as scheduled. Proceed under change-freeze discipline and HOTL safeguards; capture full evidence bundles for post-gate attestation.
Gate B (provider_register) requires evidence review in-window. Decision due at 18:20 UTC.
scholarship_agent remains in Observer Mode (no sends) until Gate A + C pass and Legal completes COPPA/ToS/Privacy sign-off for student_pilot.
student_pilot remains on compliance hold pending Legal. No data collection on minors until the server-side age gate is activated.
Rationale

This staging aligns with our Playbook’s emphasis on building a trusted, resilient platform and unlocking low-CAC growth via lifecycle communications and SEO, while protecting our ARR path and SOC 2 posture as we scale to the $10M target .
Evidence-first gates, auditable logs, and HOTL approval points are consistent with our Responsible AI requirements for explainability, traceability, and fairness monitoring in production automation .
The gate evidence to be collected (telemetry, tracing, headers, manifests) aligns with best practice observability and Replit production-readiness guidance (logs, resources, autoscale analytics) to support P95/P99, error budgets, and rollback criteria .
Cross-app integration (SSO/OIDC, webhooks, idempotency) follows our microservices-on-Replit operating model for reliable inter-app communication and auditability .
Operator instruction: workspace access

Option A (approved): Open the auto_com_center workspace now and instantiate Agent3 there for Gate A execution. If IDE access is not confirmed within 10 minutes, execute Option B.
Option B (fallback): Conduct API-only verification from the alternative workspace and raise a P1 “AUTO_COM_CENTER ACCESS” escalation until IDE access is granted.
Section V status reports

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY

Confirmation: Meets Section IV security (TLS 1.3, RBAC, audit logs), integration (webhooks with HMAC + idempotency), performance SLOs staging, DR and rollback playbooks armed; evidence instrumentation complete.
Gate A pass criteria: Inbox placement ≥95%; P95 latency ≤120ms; error rate ≤0.10%; SPF/DKIM/DMARC PASS; 30K webhook replay clean.
Evidence: Seed inbox headers, authentication results, latency histograms, webhook replay logs, error-rate telemetry, request_id traces, SHA-256 manifest. Deliver by 20:30 UTC; retain per audit policy. Observability and evidence approach per our autonomous ops and explainability guidance .
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY

Confirmation: MFA and OIDC SSO verified, token hardening, RBAC matrix enforced; TLS 1.3; immutable audit trails; P95 and error-budget targets in scope. Centralized admin and policy enforcement enabled.
Gate C tests: MFA challenge flows, SSO/OIDC discovery, token/session lifecycle, RBAC authorization checks, audit-log explainability.
Evidence: Auth test reports, OIDC metadata, RBAC matrix export, latency/error dashboards, SHA-256 manifest. XAI/traceability practices enforced per Responsible AI governance .
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Pending Gate B decision)

Blockers: Awaiting 18:00–18:15 UTC gate evidence on RBAC, onboarding E2E, encryption, API/webhook contracts, DR plan, and P95/error budgets.
Estimated Go-Live Date: 18:20 UTC today, contingent on a PASS.
ARR Ignition: Immediate post-PASS via 3% provider fee; contributes to near-term B2B revenue ramp per the Playbook’s Year 2–3 trajectory .
Third-party dependencies: Auth via scholar_auth; payment/CRM integrations as configured; status to be confirmed in gate evidence bundle.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

Blockers: Legal sign-off (ToS/Privacy/COPPA). Gate A/C must PASS before enabling lifecycle comms. Server-side COPPA age gate to remain enforced; no data collection on minors until flag switch and post-approval validation.
Estimated Go-Live Date: Nov 13–14, 16:00 UTC window.
ARR Ignition: Nov 13–15, tied to 4x AI credit markup and activation improvements; aligns with our focus on narrative coaching + matching synergy highlighted in the Playbook’s product roadmap .
Third-party dependencies: OIDC via scholar_auth; payment processor; content safety and telemetry stacks; all to remain in “monitor-only” until Legal signs off.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Observer Mode)

Blockers: No sends until Gate A + C PASS and Legal sign-off. HOTL approval gates and fairness telemetry must remain active; suppression lists locked.
Estimated Go-Live Date: Warm-up authorized post-CEO review Nov 13+; projected ARR contribution after warm-up completes around Dec 4+.
Evidence: Rationale coverage, fairness telemetry rollups, suppression logic, rollback plan; all retained with SHA-256 manifests per explainability/accountability frameworks .
Tonight’s execution and decision points

18:00–18:15 UTC: Gate B (provider_register). Agent3 to review evidence against pass criteria; deliver PASS/FAIL by 18:20 UTC.
19:45 UTC: Change freeze begins.
20:00–20:15 UTC: Gate A (auto_com_center) execution; Gate C (scholar_auth) in parallel.
20:45 UTC: CEO summary (GREEN/YELLOW/RED) and GO/NO-GO for warm-up.
22:15 UTC: auto_page_maker canary and CWV/IndexNow validation; foundational to our low-CAC growth engine emphasized in the Playbook .
23:00 UTC: Consolidated, immutable evidence package delivered to scholarship_sage.
KPIs to report live tonight

Platform SLOs: P95/P99 latency, error rates, inbox placement, webhook fidelity; incident and rollback triggers.
Growth: New verified users from SEO/auto_page_maker, activation to “first document upload,” free→paid credit conversion rate, ARPU from credits; provider activation and GMV with 3% fee. These map directly to the updated five-year plan’s growth and revenue targets .
Risk and controls

Maintain HOTL approval gates, clear override mechanisms, and immutable audit trails for all autonomous actions to preserve trust and regulatory readiness .
Adhere to zero-trust security, encryption in transit/at rest, and centralized observability to support rapid root-cause analysis and safe rollback .
Ensure evidence collection aligns with Replit production-readiness (Logs, Resources, Autoscale analytics) for defensible SLO/SOC 2 attestations .
CEO close

Execute Option A immediately for workspace access on auto_com_center; fall back to API-only verification with a P1 escalation if IDE access is not confirmed in 10 minutes.
Protect the 19:45–20:30 UTC critical window. Deliver evidence by 20:30 UTC and GREEN/YELLOW/RED summary by 20:45 UTC.
Our mission remains: ship value that delights students and compounds organic growth while advancing toward $10M profitable ARR on time. Proceed.
