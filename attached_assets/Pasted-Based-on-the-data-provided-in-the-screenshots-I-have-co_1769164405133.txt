Based on the data provided in the screenshots, I have completed the root cause analysis. The issue is a critical failure in the central infrastructure that is blocking both revenue channels.

Here is the breakdown of Why it's broken, What needs to be done, and the Draft Prompt for the CEO.

Part 1: The Diagnosis (Why Auth is Not Working)
Your ecosystem is built on a "Hub and Spoke" model. You have separate apps for Students and Providers, but they both rely on one central service—ScholarAuth—to handle identity. That central service is failing.

B2C Funnel (Students) is Blocked:

Evidence: In Image 2, the student clicks "Start Free." They successfully reach the login page (Image 3), but when the system attempts to process the sign-in, it crashes with a 500 Internal Server Error (Image 4).

Implication: The front end works, but the backend fails to verify credentials or create a session.

B2B Funnel (Providers) is Blocked:

Evidence: In Image 5, the provider clicks "Continue with ScholarAuth."

Result: The request fails immediately with a 500 Internal Server Error (Image 6) before a login screen even appears.

Implication: The Provider configuration is likely missing or corrupt in the Auth service, causing an instant crash.

Root Cause:

The issue is strictly isolated to the scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app service.

A 500 Error confirms the server code is crashing. This is most frequently caused by a Database Connection Failure (the app can't talk to the user database) or Missing Environment Variables (API keys/secrets) in the deployment.

Part 2: What Needs to Be Done
To restore user acquisition, the engineering team must:

Check Logs (Priority 0): Access the scholar-auth Replit console to see the specific error message causing the crash.

Verify Database: Confirm the Auth service has a working connection to the database (this is the most likely cause of a generic 500 error).

Check Config: Ensure the OIDC Client IDs (student-pilot and provider-register) are correctly defined in the Auth environment variables.

Part 3: The Prompt for the CEO
You can use the following briefing to update the CEO. It is structured to be high-impact, data-driven, and action-oriented.

Subject: URGENT: Critical Blocker – Auth Failure Stopping All User Acquisition

Executive Summary We are currently facing a critical outage in our central authentication service (ScholarAuth) that is preventing 100% of new user sign-ups. While our marketing landing pages are live, the ecosystem is broken at the entry point, blocking both B2B and B2C funnels.

The Situation (Data Analysis) I have diagnosed the failure points across our active environments:

Student Funnel (B2C): Users can view the site, but the "Sign In" flow terminates in a system crash (500 Internal Server Error).

Provider Funnel (B2B): Schools attempting to register are blocked immediately by the same system crash.

Root Cause: The failure is a server-side exception within the scholar-auth service. This is likely due to a database connection failure or misconfigured API secrets in the backend.

Immediate Action Plan To unblock the funnels, I am directing the engineering team to:

Prioritize ScholarAuth: Focus entirely on debugging the backend logs to identify the crash exception.

Validate Secrets: Ensure the database connection strings and Client IDs are correctly configured.

Pause Spend: I recommend pausing any paid marketing traffic until this is resolved to avoid wasting budget on a broken funnel.

Projected Outcome Once scholar-auth is stabilized, both the Student and Provider flows will immediately become functional without requiring further changes to the front-end websites.
