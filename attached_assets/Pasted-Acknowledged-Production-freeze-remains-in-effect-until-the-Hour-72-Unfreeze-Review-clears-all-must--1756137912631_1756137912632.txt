Acknowledged. Production freeze remains in effect until the Hour 72 Unfreeze Review clears all must‑pass criteria. Proceed with the pre‑read delivery two hours before the review.

Two final adds before the meeting

Data protection drill: Confirm point‑in‑time recovery (PITR) restore has been validated in the last 24 hours in staging (snapshot + timed restore). Attach evidence. This complements the app rollback drill and reduces residual data‑integrity risk.
Public policy alignment: Queue the Privacy/ToS update note reflecting cookie SameSite changes and security hardening (publish post‑Go). Legal text can be brief; link to our compliance changelog.
Go/No‑Go comms templates (prep now, send only after decision)

Go (internal + status page)
“We completed the 72‑hour security and reliability hardening. All must‑pass criteria met (0 Critical/High, secret scans clean, access controls verified, SQLi tests blocked, SLOs stable). Traffic ramp begins now: 10%→50%→100% with guardrails.”
No‑Go (internal + status page)
“We paused the unfreeze due to [issue]. Guardrails worked as designed (auto‑rollback/freeze). Next steps: root cause and remediation ETA [X], rescheduled review at [time]. No customer data exposure or billing impact.”
Hour 72 meeting is unchanged

Timebox: 30 minutes. I will chair the session and render the Go/No‑Go.
Pre‑reads due: QA/Sec full rerun + deltas + canary checklist; DevOps CI‑gate proofs + dashboards; Backend/Frontend test IDs + logs (auth/SSR/SQLi/error‑handling); Billing reconciliation $0; Redis limiter metrics.
Post‑Go 24‑hour targets (report back at T+24)

Security: 0 PII redaction violations; ≤0.5% rate‑limit false positives (or approved 24h mitigation plan); $0 reconciliation deltas.
Reliability: ≥99.9% uptime; p95 within ±10% of baseline; endpoint contract health 100%; SSR error rate steady.
Process: All CI security/type gates stay mandatory (no main merges that bypass gates).
Contingencies

If any must‑pass looks at risk by Hour 60, escalate in the exec channel with options and impact. Do not wait for the review.
Auto‑rollback and immediate refreeze remain active on p95 +15%, 5xx +0.5%, or any PII redaction violation.
Upon Go

Traffic ramp: 10% (2h) → 50% (4h) → 100% if guardrails hold.
Deployment order behind flags: pricing/onboarding experiments → Provider Portal MVP slices → SEO instrumentation and CWV beacons.
War room stays live through the 8‑hour ramp; on‑call primary/secondary confirmed.
Quality over speed remains the rule until we clear the bar. Proceed.
