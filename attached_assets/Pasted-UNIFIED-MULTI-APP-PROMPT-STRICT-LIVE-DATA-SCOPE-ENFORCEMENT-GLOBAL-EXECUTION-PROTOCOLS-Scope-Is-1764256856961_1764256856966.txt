UNIFIED MULTI-APP PROMPT (STRICT LIVE-DATA & SCOPE ENFORCEMENT)
GLOBAL EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

Scope Isolation: You must only execute the instructions in the section titled "SECTION <N>: <your_app_id>". Ignore all other sections.

Self-Identification: Before starting any work, you must output a "Self-ID Block": APP_ID: <your_app_id> | APP_BASE_URL: <your_base_url>

Zero-Mock Tolerance: No simulated, fixture, seed, sample, stub, or default fallback values may appear in user-facing views.

Visual Truth Rule: If the UI (or a user screenshot) says "Data source: simulated", you must treat this as a CRITICAL BUG. You must locate the flag triggering that label (e.g., USE_SIMULATED_DATA) and disable it permanently in favor of live DB queries.

SECTION 3: scholarship_agent (Agent3) — EXECUTE THIS SECTION ONLY
1. Mandatory Self-ID & Context

Identity: scholarship_agent

Base URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Context: The CEO is reporting that mock data is still visible on the frontend dashboards. The UI may still be displaying "Data source: simulated" or static numbers despite previous fixes.

2. The "Deep Dive" Audit (Forensic Code Review) You must perform a root-cause analysis of why mock data persists. Do not assume previous fixes worked.

Target 1 (The Flag): Search for environment variables or boolean flags like USE_SIMULATED_DATA, MOCK_MODE, or IS_DEMO in client/src and server/. If found defaulting to true, change it to false.

Target 2 (The Fallback): Check CampaignCommandCenter.tsx and Dashboard.tsx. Look for logic like const data = apiData || MOCK_DATA. Remove the fallback. If the API fails, the UI should show an error, not fake data.

Target 3 (The Label): grep for the string "Data source: simulated". Locate the exact conditional rendering that displays this text and verify what condition triggers it.

3. Live Data Verification (Backend & Frontend) You must verify that the numbers shown on the dashboard come from the database right now.

Backend: Query the database directly (SQL count) for campaign_sends, telemetry_events, and user_consent.

API: Curl your own endpoint (/api/campaign/report or /api/executive/dashboard) and confirm the JSON response matches the database counts exactly.

Frontend: Confirm the frontend is wiring that specific API response to the KPI widgets.

4. Deliverable: Live Data Verification Report You must produce a report with this exact structure:

HEADER: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

1. Forensic Findings:

Mock Flags Found: [List files/lines or "None"]

Simulation Logic: [Describe any "if (simulated)" blocks found]

"Data source: simulated" Label: [Found/Removed/Fixed]

2. Live Data Proof:

Database Count (Campaign Sends): [Integer]

API Response (Campaign Sends): [Integer]

Dashboard Value (Campaign Sends): [Integer] (These three numbers MUST match exactly)

3. Fix Action:

[List files modified to remove mocks]

[List environment variables updated]

4. Decision:

STATUS: PASS (Only if "Data source: live" is visible and numbers match DB)

STATUS: FAILED (If any mock data remains)
