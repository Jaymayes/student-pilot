CEO Executive Directive — Operation Synergy (FOC Path to Green)

Decision Summary (effective immediately)

Gate 1 (scholar_auth) — GO NOW

Auth DRI (human) must click Republish in Replit Publishing tool immediately.
SLA: 10 minutes total (2–5 min publish + 5 min verification).
Verification: Run the provided Gate 1 script (JWKS valid RS256, /canary v2.7, 6/6 security headers). Post outputs to war-room.
If RED at T+30: open platform ticket with Replit and proceed with EPD prep (no cutover).
If still RED at T+45: EXECUTE EPD-Auth-01 cutover to alternate hosting. Budget pre-approved: $1,500. Requirements: dual KID rotation (24h overlap), updated JWKS_URL in all 7 downstream services, acceptance checks before cutover.
Gate 2 (scholarship_api) — CONDITIONAL GO

Trigger: Gate 1 GREEN.
SLA: Deploy within 30 minutes of Gate 1 GREEN; post evidence within 15 minutes of deploy.
Acceptance: /canary v2.7 (8 fields), 6/6 headers, 401/403 RBAC, JWKS validation live, P95 ≤120ms (≤250ms acceptable during first 10 minutes warm-up), 5xx <0.5%.
If any criterion fails, rollback immediately and redeploy within 30 minutes.
Gate 3 (student_pilot) — CONDITIONAL GO

Trigger: Gate 2 GREEN.
SLA: E2E smoke within 15 minutes (auth → profile → search → recommendations → submit → status → dry-run comms); post HAR, screenshots, and 30-sample P95.
auto_com_center — Maintain DRY-RUN posture

Kill switch stays enabled (DISABLE_SEND=true).
Postmark: configure only; do not activate until CEO confirms post–Gate 3.
Evidence bundle already accepted. Continue 15-min cadence.
scholarship_sage — GREEN accepted

Participate in Gate 3 smoke; capture recommendation latency and accuracy.
A/B testing OFF for 48 hours post platform-wide GREEN.
provider_register — GREEN (conditional)

No onboarding until Gate 2 GREEN.
On Gate 2 GREEN: verify 3% fee disclosure and RBAC tenant isolation; then enable first cohort (10–20) within 5 minutes.
auto_page_maker — STANDBY

Fire generation webhooks post–Gate 2 GREEN; hold indexing until data accuracy is validated in production smoke.
Assignments and Owners

Auth DRI (human, with Replit access): Click Republish for scholar_auth now and run verification script. Confirm to war-room within 10 minutes.
API DRI: Execute Gate 2 deploy within 30 minutes of Gate 1 GREEN; post evidence and declare GREEN if all checks pass.
Frontend DRI: Run Gate 3 smoke within 15 minutes of Gate 2 GREEN; post evidence bundle.
Comms DRI (auto_com_center): Remain in dry-run; queue events; no external sends until CEO Day-1 ramp confirmation.
Sage DRI: Join Gate 3; record latency/accuracy; A/B off 48h.
Contingency (EPD-Auth-01) — Pre-stage now, cutover at T+45 if needed

Platform: Prepare a fast Node/Flask-friendly host (Railway or Render).
Surface: Preserve OIDC/JWKS shape (RS256, /.well-known/jwks.json).
Security: Publish both KIDs for 24h overlap; verify downstream acceptance.
Config: Pre-provision JWKS_URL env updates for all 7 services. Do not apply unless Gate 1 remains RED at T+45.
Acceptance before cutover: Canary 8/8 fields, 6/6 headers, P95 ≤120ms, RBAC 401/403, JWKS validation pass, dependencies_ok=true.
Evidence and Cadence

War-room updates every 15 minutes or on gate transition.
Each gate evidence must include exact curl outputs, timing samples (≥30 for P95), and screenshots/HAR where applicable.
Code freeze: v2.7 locked for 24h post platform-wide GREEN; hotfixes only.
Go/No-Go Criteria

Gate 1 GREEN required to unlock Gate 2.
Gate 2 GREEN required to unlock Gate 3.
No live outbound comms until Gate 3 smoke passes and CEO authorizes Day-1 ramp.
SLO protection: 99.9% uptime, P95 ≤120ms, 5xx <0.5%.
Immediate Confirmation Required

Auth DRI: Acknowledge ability to click Republish within 5 minutes and post Gate 1 verification results within 10 minutes.
API/Frontend/Comms/Sage DRIs: Acknowledge receipt of SLAs and readiness to execute on triggers.
Strategic Note
This sequencing preserves SLOs, minimizes CAC by avoiding premature comms, and keeps us on the fastest credible path to FOC. Execute with urgency and post verifiable evidence at each gate.
