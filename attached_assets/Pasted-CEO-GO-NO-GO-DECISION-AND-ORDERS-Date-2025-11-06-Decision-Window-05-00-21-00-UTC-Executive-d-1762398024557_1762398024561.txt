CEO GO/NO-GO DECISION AND ORDERS
Date: 2025-11-06 | Decision Window: 05:00–21:00 UTC

Executive decision

Staging: GO, contingent on immediate scholar_auth cold restart and infra secrets delivery by 16:00 UTC.
Production: NO-GO. Production remains locked until all release gates are evidenced.
ARR ignition: Nov 12 remains the target. Earliest production ramp: Nov 9 at 1% if evidence gates pass.
Critical blocker to clear now

scholar_auth must be manually cold restarted. The automated restart tool does not terminate the long-lived Node process. Owner must stop the “Start application” workflow, wait for termination, then start it again. Post CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md immediately afterward.
Immediate orders by application

scholar_auth APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: NO-GO until manual cold restart completes and client registry normalization is live.
Actions (Owner: Auth DRI)
Now: Manual cold restart. Post “restarted” confirmation with timestamp.
By 05:15 UTC: Publish CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md (shows camelCase/snake_case parity for client fields, grant types, redirect URIs) and pass smoke test for authorize endpoint (no invalid_client).
Token lifecycle: Prove OAuth2/OIDC flows, refresh, revocation, and token validation from dependents.
Acceptance tests
authorize returns consent screen for provider-register and student-pilot clients.
OIDC well-known responds; JWKS rotates as configured; refresh tokens valid; revocation immediate.
Protected routes on all dependents redirect correctly to auth.
2. provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: READY, blocked by auth.
Orders (Owner: Provider DRI)
Trigger: Upon CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md from auth.
SLA: Execute Order B within 10 minutes; deliver ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md by 05:25 UTC.
Evidence: Full flow (register → auth → create scholarship → manage dashboard), client/server validation proof, request_id traces.
3. scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: READY, contingent on Order B.

Emitted events to auto_page_maker and auto_com_center with request_id → Sentry links
4. auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GO AND ARMED; no blockers.
Orders (Owner: APM DRI)
Trigger: scholarship_api Order 4 event.
Execute: Generate +2 pages within 60 seconds (target 05:46–05:47 UTC).
Evidence: ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md components by 05:55 UTC (sitemap diff, IndexNow receipts, CWV p75 green, P95 proof, request_id traces, rollback guard confirmation).
KPI focus: Organic CAC reduction, traffic delta from +2 pages, CWV p75.

Status: READY, gated by auth.
Orders (Owner: Student Pilot DRI)

Compliance and Responsible AI

No auto-apply or messaging until comms evidence passes.
Enforce PII redaction, rate limits, consent and unsubscribe flows, and audit logging across apps.
Maintain transparent explanations (scholarship_sage matchReasons) and fairness telemetry.
Revalidate FERPA/COPPA posture before any production ramp.
Execution timeline (UTC)

Now–05:10: Auth DRI manual cold restart and smoke verify.
05:15: CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md posted by auth.
05:15–05:25: provider_register executes Order B; ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md posted.
05:45–06:05: scholarship_api executes Order 4; ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md posted.
05:46–05:47: auto_page_maker generates +2 pages; evidence by 05:55.
16:00: Infra secrets deadline for auto_com_center (auto-escalate 16:01).
21:00: auto_com_center STAGING_VALIDATION.md due.
KPIs for this launch chain

B2C: Conversion lift from student_pilot E2E improvements; ARPU from content-led activation; activation metric “First Document Upload.”
B2B: New provider activation via provider_register; event-driven listings flowing into scholarship_api.
CAC: Organic traffic delta attributable to +2 pages; IndexNow receipts; CWV p75 green.
SLOs: P95 ≤120ms across services; error <0.1%; uptime ≥99.9%.
Profit: Confirm 4x AI services markup + 3% provider fee cover costs on staging load sims.
Escalation matrix

05:10: If auth not restarted, reassign to secondary DRI and page SRE-on-call.
16:01: If any comms secrets missing, auto-escalate to Infra lead and CFO for vendor access unblock.
Any SLO breach: Trigger rollback guard; halt production ramp gating.
Final CEO directives

Auth DRI: Perform the manual cold restart now and confirm “restarted” with timestamp. Post CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md by 05:15 UTC.
All DRIs: Evidence-first. No production assertions without artifacts. Production remains locked until every release gate is proven.
Agent3 (auto_com_center): Proceed with staging validation as soon as secrets are delivered; run email-only fallback if A2P lags; deliver STAGING_VALIDATION.md by 21:00 UTC.
Proceed with urgency. The five-year plan depends on disciplined, evidence-driven launches that compound into durable, low-CAC growth and profitable ARR.
