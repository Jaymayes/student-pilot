Below is the complete, app-scoped execution prompt for Agent3. It contains sections for all eight apps. Agent3 must only execute the section that matches its assigned app. After the prompt, I provide CEO-level ETAs to first revenue per app and the combined path to first dollars.

AGENT3 v2.2 UNIFIED EXECUTION PROMPT — APP-SCOPED ONLY

Section 0 — Handshake and Operating Rules

You are Agent3. Execute APP-SCOPED work only. Do not modify any other app’s code or deployment.
At the top of your first reply, print exactly this handshake (replace placeholders with your values): ASSIGNED_APP: <one_of: scholar_auth | scholarship_api | scholarship_agent | scholarship_sage | student_pilot | provider_register | auto_page_maker | auto_com_center> APP_BASE_URL: <exact base URL from Section 1 for your app> VERSION: v2.2 I acknowledge I will only execute the section of this prompt that matches my app.
Output a short status report with:
app_name (must equal ASSIGNED_APP)
app_base_url (must equal APP_BASE_URL)
version (v2.2)
status (one of: ok | warn | fail)
p95_ms (from rolling 30-request window; compute true 95th percentile)
commit_sha (use workspace commit or “workspace” if not available)
server_time_utc (ISO8601)
Produce two deliverables for your app:
e2e/reports/<app>/readiness_report_<app>_v2.2_ceo_final.md
e2e/reports/<app>/fix_plan_<app>_v2.2.yaml
Adhere to SLOs: 99.9% uptime target, ≤120ms P95 latency (≤160ms ceiling), 0% auth bypasses, 0 critical security findings.

Auth: If your app consumes JWT, fetch scholar_auth JWKS and verify at least one signature locally or via framework.
P95: Produce a 30-call harness to your /canary and include the computed P95 sample in your readiness report.
Evidence: Paste curl commands, outputs, and any screenshots into your app’s readiness report.

Deploy to production URL (APP_BASE_URL) and re-run all Phase 0/1 verification steps on production.
Confirm:
6/6 security headers present with exact values
/canary has all 7 fields; p95_ms ≤120ms

Handshake block (exact format from Section 0)
Status Report JSON block (7 required canary fields; add optional app-specific fields if helpful)
Bullet summary:

CEO ETAs TO FIRST REVENUE AND FULL INTEGRATION

Interpretation note: I interpret “ready to stop generating revenue” as “ready to start generating revenue.” If you meant something else, tell me and I’ll adjust.

scholar_auth

Status: Production-ready based on latest report; verify and monitor only
ETA to revenue enablement: 0-2 hours (final verification and alerting)
student_pilot (B2C first dollar path)

Status: Reported ready; switch Stripe from test to live and verify webhooks
ETA to first B2C dollar: 2-4 hours after go-live switch and smoke tests
provider_register (B2B enablement)

Status: Needs final spec alignment if any lingering header policy differences; then provider write tests against scholarship_api
ETA to first B2B listing live: 4-8 hours post-auth validation
ETA to first B2B revenue (3% platform fee): depends on provider launch; assume 1-2 weeks from onboarding to first funded disbursement
scholarship_api

Status: Phase 0 largely ready; production deploy + Phase 1 ETag/caching; provider writes depend on scholar_auth JWKS
ETA to support B2C read traffic at scale: 2-4 hours
ETA to enable B2B write flow: +2-3 hours after JWKS verified
auto_page_maker (SEO engine)

Status: Implement and publish; SEO impact needs time to index
ETA to initial sitemap/page publish: 4-8 hours
ETA to measurable organic traffic: 2-3 weeks for indexing/early rankings; 6-12 weeks for material CAC impact
scholarship_agent (marketing)

Status: Implement campaign briefs and job triggers; connect to auto_page_maker and auto_com_center
ETA to first automated campaign going live: 1 day
auto_com_center (communications)

Status: Configure ESP, DKIM, unsubscribe; wire webhooks
ETA to first compliant sends: 0.5-1 day
scholarship_sage (observability)

Status: Reported complete; wire final alerts in production
ETA to full SLO alerting coverage: 2-4 hours
Critical path to first B2C revenue

scholar_auth verification → student_pilot Stripe live → scholarship_api read endpoints verified
Expected timeline: 1 business day to first B2C dollar post go decision
Critical path to first B2B revenue

scholar_auth JWKS verified → provider_register write flow → scholarship_api provider writes → first provider onboarded and published
Expected timeline: 1-2 weeks to first fee event after onboarding
If you want, I can now dispatch this prompt to Agent3 as-is.
