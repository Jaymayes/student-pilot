Agent3 Prompt: Unified Launch, Telemetry, and E2E Validation (Use ONLY the section for your app)

Read carefully. Execute only the parts of this prompt that explicitly apply to your app. Before taking any action, identify yourself by name and base URL exactly as specified below so there is no confusion.

Global Directives (All Apps)

Identification: Before any action, output: START APP_ENROLL | APP_NAME=<your app name> | APP_BASE_URL=<your base url>
Scope discipline: Only read and execute the section labeled with your APP_NAME. Ignore all other sections.
Telemetry baseline: Emit operational and business events to the Command Center. Include APP_NAME and APP_BASE_URL in every event and report.
Command Center ingest: Send all events to auto_com_center at this contract:
POST {AUTO_COM_CENTER}/api/ingest/events
POST {AUTO_COM_CENTER}/api/ingest/metrics
Health check: GET {AUTO_COM_CENTER}/api/health
If an endpoint returns 404, retry with /ingest, /metrics, or /log as fallback. If failures persist, log a telemetry_error event and continue.
Event schema (include fields as applicable):
app_name, app_base_url, env, event_type, timestamp_iso, request_id, session_id, user_id_hash, provider_id_hash, route_or_action, status, http_code, latency_ms, bytes_in, bytes_out, cache_hit, error_code, error_message, revenue_event (true/false), revenue_source (b2c|b2b), amount_usd, currency, attribution (utm params), referrer, device, geo_country
SLOs to monitor and report:
Uptime target 99.9%
P95 latency ~120ms
Error rate <1%
KPI alignment (include these in metrics):
B2C funnel: site visits, signups, activation, credit purchases, ARPU
B2B funnel: provider signups, listings posted, transactions, 3% fee revenue
CAC proxy: organic traffic from Auto Page Maker (SEO pages) vs paid (should be near-zero)
Security and compliance:
Pseudonymize user_id/provider_id (hash with a static salt). No PII in logs.
Do not log secrets, tokens, or raw form inputs containing sensitive data.
Frontend display: Ensure all your metrics render in auto_com_center dashboards. Emit a dashboard_config event describing the panels/queries you need visible.
Test records: Prefix all E2E test data with TEST_. Clean up after tests or mark for TTL purge.
E2E Tests to Run (Each app runs ONLY its own steps; do not cross-manage other apps. Command Center will correlate via request_id/session_id):

Global E2E IDs (use these exact values):
e2e_run_id: E2E_001
student_test_email: test_student+001@scholaraiadvisor.com
provider_test_email: test_provider+001@scholaraiadvisor.com
request_id root: REQ_E2E_001
session_id root: SES_E2E_001
Success criteria (Command Center will evaluate):
SEO page generated, indexed pinged, visited
Student signup completed
Scholarship search returns results
Scholarship recommendation and guidance delivered
Credit purchase or monetized action recorded (B2C)
Provider onboarded and listing created (B2B)
3% fee revenue event logged (B2B)
All events visible on Command Center frontend in near real-time

Perform your Health Check and emit telemetry.
Execute your E2E test steps using the IDs provided.
Emit dashboard_config so your metrics are visible on the frontend.
