Acknowledged. As CEO, I won’t run the clicks myself in this environment (no external network access), but I am directing and gating the frontend FOC checks now. Below is the concise test plan, acceptance gates, per-app checklists, deliverables, and timeline to declare GREEN across all eight apps.

What’s happening now

Assignments: The Agent3 instance for each app is the DRI to execute the steps below on production URLs.
Objective: Verify that every public-facing UI flow is functional, fast, secure, accessible, and integrated end-to-end with scholar_auth and scholarship_api.
Evidence required: Screenshots, HAR files, and short screencasts for core flows; JSON of canary responses; 5-sample latency table.
Frontend FOC Test Suite (common for all apps)

Tools: Use Chrome stable, Lighthouse (Performance + Accessibility), DevTools Network (HAR export), and your existing e2e runner (e.g., Cypress/Playwright) if available.
Devices: Desktop 1440px and Mobile viewport 390px (iPhone 12/13 profile).
Network: Test on “Fast 3G” throttle for UX resilience and on normal broadband.
Security headers: Confirm 6/6 present on main UI routes (Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options or CSP frame-ancestors, Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy).
Canary v2.7: Confirm 8 fields and P95 ≤ 120ms. Capture JSON response and timing.
Accessibility: WCAG AA quick checks via Lighthouse; no critical contrast or label issues on core flows.
Per-app frontend checklists (production URLs)

student_pilot → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Auth: register → verify email flow (or mock), login, logout; tokens stored securely (HttpOnly or secure storage).
Core UX: dashboard loads; profile edit/save; search scholarships (scholarship_api), open details; apply flow including document upload; view application status; recommendations render from scholarship_sage.
Mobile/responsive: primary pages usable at 390px; no horizontal scroll.
Error UX: show friendly errors for 401/403/500; retry works.
2. provider_register → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Auth: login as Provider; RBAC-confirmed views.
Scholarship management: create/edit/publish listing; data persists to scholarship_api; validation and sanitization enforced.
Applicant review: list, filter, sort, change status; only own org’s data visible.
Compliance: 3% Platform Fee visibly disclosed in billing area; capture screenshot.
Performance/accessibility: Lighthouse ≥ 70 performance and ≥ 90 accessibility on key pages.
3. scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

UI availability: login/register pages render without console errors.
OIDC/OAuth redirect flows: initiate from student_pilot/provider_register and complete successfully.
JWKS health: surface a simple status page or JSON (if provided) and verify with dependent services (screenshot of dependency health if UI exists).
Canary v2.7: JSON returns 8 fields; latency under SLO.
4. scholarship_api → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

API docs/landing (if UI exists): loads; CORS allows all 8 platform origins; standardized error JSON visible in console tests.
From UIs: verify authorized reads/writes from student_pilot and provider_register succeed; unauthorized calls return 401/403 with proper JSON error.
Canary v2.7: capture JSON + timing.
5. scholarship_sage → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Any dashboard/status page (if present) loads with no console errors.
From UIs: recommendations visible in student_pilot; advisory tools render where integrated; latency below targets.
6. scholarship_agent → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status/health UI (if present): verify event queue depth, last-run timestamps visible.
Trigger visible outcomes in UIs: e.g., auto updates to deadlines reflected in student_pilot; capture before/after screenshots.
7. auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Generated landing pages: accessible and correctly populated; SEO metadata present (title, meta description, schema.org JSON-LD).
Visual QA: consistent branding; no broken images/links; mobile renders well.
Deployment confirmation: new/updated scholarship triggers a fresh page; provide page URL and timestamp.
8. auto_com_center → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status/queue UI (if present): loads clean.
From UIs: trigger a transactional message (dry-run if required) and confirm queued/sent status; capture response JSON and UI evidence of delivery status.
Acceptance gates to declare GREEN

Performance: Page interactive ≤ 2.5s on broadband, ≤ 4s on Fast 3G for core pages; API P95 ≤ 120ms.
Security: 6/6 headers on UI routes; HTTPS-only; no mixed content; auth tokens secured; RBAC enforced (no provider sees other orgs; no student sees other students).
Accessibility: Lighthouse accessibility ≥ 90 on primary flows (login, dashboard, listing, apply).
Stability: No severe console errors; graceful error messages for network and auth failures.
Interop: Auth redirects complete; scholarship_api read/write from UIs; sage recommendations render; auto_com_center receives at least one event-driven message reflected in UI or logs; auto_page_maker publishes at least one page from a new/updated listing.
Compliance: 3% platform fee visibly disclosed in provider_register.
Deliverables (submit for each app)

Section 7 report (use template below).
Evidence bundle: 3-5 screenshots per app covering core flows; 1 HAR per app of core path; Lighthouse JSON exports for desktop+mobile on one key page; canary v2.7 JSON + 5-sample latency table.

OPERATIONAL READINESS DECLARATION
[READY / NOT READY]
*** END REPORT ***

Timeline and ownership

T+0 to T+1.5h: Agent DRIs execute front-end checks and compile evidence.
T+1.5h to T+2h: Submit Section 7 reports + evidence bundle for each app.
T+2h: Consolidated GO/NO-GO by me based on acceptance gates; if any app is RED but non-blocking for first revenue, we’ll proceed with documented mitigations.
No-GO triggers

scholar_auth JWKS or redirect failure.
scholarship_api not deployed or failing 401/403 RBAC enforcement.
student_pilot cannot complete apply flow on production.
provider_register cannot publish a listing or fee disclosure missing.
What I need from you to proceed fast

Confirm that production deployments for scholar_auth and scholarship_api are live.
Provide one test Student and one test Provider account (or confirm self-service registration is functional).
Authorize DRIs to attach screenshots/HARs in a shared folder and submit the Section 7 reports.
Once I receive the eight Section 7 reports and evidence bundles, I will issue the platform-wide readiness decision. My expectation remains first revenue today, provided auth and API are GREEN.
