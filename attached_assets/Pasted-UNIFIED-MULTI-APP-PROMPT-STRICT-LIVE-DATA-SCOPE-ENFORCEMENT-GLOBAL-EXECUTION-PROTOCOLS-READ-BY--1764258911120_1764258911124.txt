UNIFIED MULTI-APP PROMPT (STRICT LIVE-DATA & SCOPE ENFORCEMENT)
GLOBAL EXECUTION PROTOCOLS (READ BY ALL APPS)

Scope Isolation: You must only execute the instructions in the section titled "SECTION <N>: <your_app_id>". Ignore all other sections.

Self-Identification: Before starting any work, you must output a "Self-ID Block": APP_ID: <your_app_id> | APP_BASE_URL: <your_base_url>

Strict Live-Data Policy:

Zero Mock Tolerance: You are strictly forbidden from generating, reporting, or displaying mock, seed, fixture, placeholder, or "sample" data.

Verification: You must verify that every number displayed on the frontend originates from a database query or an upstream API call.

Audit: If you find const data = [...] or hardcoded JSON in the frontend code, you must flag it as a CRITICAL FAILURE.

Reporting: All outputs must start with the App Name and Base URL.

SECTION 3: scholarship_agent (Agent3) — EXECUTE THIS SECTION ONLY
1. Mandatory Self-ID & Context

Identity: scholarship_agent

Base URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Mission: Orchestrate scholarship campaigns using only live student segments and real provider data.

2. Deep Dive Audit: Mock Data Elimination You stated that mock data is still visible. You must perform a forensic audit of the frontend code (client/src).

Search Targets: Scan for terms: "mock", "dummy", "fixture", "placeholder", "sample", "static".

Logic Check: Inspect CampaignCommandCenter.tsx and its child components. Look for fallbacks like || defaultData or const data = [...].

Network Verification: Ensure the dashboard uses useEffect or useQuery to hit /api/campaign/report. If the endpoint fails, the UI should show an error or loading state, NOT fake numbers.

3. Data Architecture Report (Backend Inputs & Frontend Outputs) You must verify and report on the following data flow. If the code does not match this, you must fix it.

A. Backend Inputs (Data Received):

From scholar_auth:

auth_token (JWT): Must be validated for role admin or system.

consent_flags: Boolean flags for TCPA compliance.

From scholarship_api:

scholarship_batch: Array of live objects { id, title, amount, deadline, ranking_score }.

From auto_com_center (Webhooks):

telemetry_event: { event: "open"|"click", campaign_id, user_id, timestamp }.

B. Frontend Outputs (Data Shown on Dashboard): The CampaignCommandCenter must display only this live data structure fetched from /api/campaign/report:

JSON

{
  "kpis": {
    "sends": "Integer (Count from DB)",
    "opens": "Integer (Count from DB)",
    "clicks": "Integer (Count from DB)",
    "ctr": "Float (clicks/sends)",
    "revenue": "Float (Sum of attributed credit sales)"
  },
  "compliance": {
    "tcpa_blocks": "Integer (Blocked SMS counts)",
    "quiet_hours_blocks": "Integer (Blocked overnight sends)"
  }
}
4. Execution Steps

Print Header: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL=https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Run Audit: Scan the frontend code for the static data preventing the live view.

Verify Backend: Curl /api/campaign/report and confirm it returns database values (not static 200 OKs).

Generate Status Report: Output the "Live Performance Report" using the schema above.

Final Decision:

If mocks are found: STATUS: FAILED_VALIDATION (List specific files/lines).

If all data is live: STATUS: PASS.
