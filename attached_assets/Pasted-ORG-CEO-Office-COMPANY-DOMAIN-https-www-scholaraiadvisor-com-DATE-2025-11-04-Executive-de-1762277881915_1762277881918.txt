Executive decision

Proceed with Option A immediately. Produce the exact implementation plan and handoff for scholar_auth. In parallel, arrange Option B access so we can accelerate any follow‑ups or hardening. Option C remains off the table unless a secure admin API exists and is approved.
Rationale

We operate with a data-first, low-CAC mandate on an aggressive timeline. Option A gives us deterministic progress now; Option B ensures speed if any residual issues surface. Your “OAuth GREEN” report is promising, but we need formal evidence from the scholar_auth DRI to lock Gate A.
Immediate orders by application

scholar_auth APP_NAME: scholar_auth | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Post “OAUTH GREEN – EVIDENCE” within 15 minutes in the mandatory format.
Evidence must include:
Discovery JSON from /.well-known/openid-configuration, JWKS, issuer match (no path), auth and token endpoints, sample auth code → token exchange (redacted), PKCE S256 enforced, nonce checked.
RBAC roles in production: Student, Provider, Admin (policy snippets).
Endpoints live and rate-limited: registration, login, token validation, password recovery (with lockout/brute‑force controls).
Notification to auto_com_center wired for registration and password reset events (payload schema + sample event).
Health: /health = 200 OK, Sentry/Datadog connected, request_id correlation, no PII in logs.
Database: confirm production-grade managed DB (e.g., RDS/Neon/Atlas). Replit DB is not acceptable.
Deliverable for Option A: A step-by-step implementation plan for any remaining items and hardening (file paths, commands, test steps). Treat this as DRI-ready runbook.
2. provider_register
APP_NAME: provider_register | APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

On receipt of scholar_auth “OAUTH GREEN – EVIDENCE,” execute Order B immediately and post the 25‑minute evidence bundle:
Auth success ≥99.5% (5‑min rolling); RBAC allow/deny proofs; PKCE trace; JWKS kid match; 5xx <0.2%.
If auth success drops below 99.5% over any 5‑min window: STOP and page CEO.
3. scholarship_api
APP_NAME: scholarship_api | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Trigger: provider_register “ORDER B PASS.”
Within 2 minutes, execute Order 3:
Create 2 test scholarships; emit scholarship_created events to auto_page_maker.
Maintain P95 ≤120ms; post full request_id chain through indexnow and evidence bundle at the T+40–T+42 checkpoint.
4. auto_page_maker
APP_NAME: auto_page_maker | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Trigger: scholarship_api Order 3 events.
Within 60 seconds, confirm page count 2,101 → 2,103 (+2), push IndexNow, and post CWV p75 PASS/FAIL:
LCP ≤2.5s, CLS ≤0.1, INP ≤200ms.
5. student_pilot
APP_NAME: student_pilot | APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Trigger: provider_register PASS + 5 minutes.
Launch Phase 1 (10% live Stripe / 90% test). Guardrails armed:
Payment success ≥98.5%, 5xx <0.2%, auth ≥99.5%, CVR deviation ±10% with <60s auto‑rollback.
Post launch confirmation and deliver the 24h revenue snapshot.
6. scholarship_sage
APP_NAME: scholarship_sage | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Maintain observe-only posture. Keep P95 ≤10ms. No API/schema changes. Ensure /recommendations/{student_id} remains green and explainability signals available to student_pilot.
7. scholarship_agent
APP_NAME: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Gate B DRY‑RUN remains GO at T+65. Post START at T+65, EVIDENCE at T+215, PASS/FAIL at T+225 with the pre‑stated pass criteria and abort thresholds.
8. auto_com_center
APP_NAME: auto_com_center | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Post readiness in 30 minutes:
Asynchronous queue operational, DLQ=0; ESP (SendGrid/Mailgun) and SMS gateway keys validated; templates complete (Welcome, Status Update, Deadline Reminder).
Event subscriptions live for scholar_auth (registration, password reset) and scholarship_api (application status change).
Compliance: unsubscribe/opt‑out, CAN‑SPAM/CASL, rate limits, no PII in logs, Sentry/Datadog DSN active.
Mandatory platform-wide confirmations (all 8 apps)

Health: /health returns 200 OK and verifies critical dependencies.
Security: TLS only, 6/6 security headers, RBAC enforced, rate limits active, PII redaction in logs.
Observability: Centralized error/perf monitoring (Sentry/Datadog), request_id correlation end‑to‑end.
Data: Managed production DBs only; scholarship_api must have secure object storage (AWS S3) for documents.
Payments (where applicable): Stripe in live mode per launch plan; keys rotated and scoped.
Business and KPI checkpoints tied to this push

SEO growth proof: +2 pages within 60s of trigger and CWV p75 pass → protects low‑CAC engine.
Auth quality: ≥99.5% success during Order B and Phase 1 launch window.
API SLO: P95 ≤120ms for scholarship_api during Order 3.
Early monetization: student_pilot 24h snapshot with free→paid conversion, ARPU from credits, and attribution from auto_page_maker.
B2B activation: provider_register evidence that providers can onboard and manage listings; verify 3% fee path is technically enabled (even if not yet monetized).
Risk controls and ethics

FERPA/COPPA posture reviewed; no sensitive data in logs; data retention and access controls confirmed.
Responsible AI: scholarship_sage explainability on, bias checks gated before any expansion; no academic dishonesty features.
Next executive gates

Gate A (Auth): PASS only on scholar_auth evidence + provider_register Order B PASS.
Gate 3 Deployment Readiness: Confirm once auto_page_maker +2 pages and scholarship_api P95 hold, then proceed to student_pilot Phase 1 per trigger.
Gate B (Comms DRY‑RUN): Proceed on schedule; independent of OAuth gate.
Close

Option A is approved and required now. Provide the scholar_auth DRI runbook and the formal “OAUTH GREEN – EVIDENCE” package. All other apps: hold your current READY/ARMED posture and execute precisely on your triggers.
