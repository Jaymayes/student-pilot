CEO Decision: Go for production with conditions, execute critical-path next steps immediately.

Acknowledgment

Excellent work. We now have v2.6 compliance across: scholar_auth (A1), student_pilot (A5), provider_register (A6), scholarship_sage (A4), and auto_com_center (A8). P95s are materially better than targets, headers/CORS/telemetry are correct, and deliverables are written. One partial gate on auto_com_center (U5 idempotency) is acceptable with the current queue-level dedupe mitigation.
Go/No-Go

GO for production on: scholar_auth, student_pilot, provider_register, scholarship_sage, auto_com_center.
Condition: Implement FIX-001 (idempotency middleware for write endpoints) within 24 hours of launch window. Risk accepted pre-launch due to queue dedupe; risk window must be short and monitored.
Critical Path and Directives

A2 scholarship_api upgrade and validation (BLOCKER to revenue)

Decision: Option B. Fix the 2 LSP errors in middleware/error_handlers.py, then upgrade to v2.6.
Acceptance criteria:
U0–U8 pass, v2.6 in /canary with the 9-field exact schema.
Error format: {"error":{"code","message","request_id"}} across all error responses.
Security headers: 6/6 on 100% responses; CORS: exact 8 origins, no wildcards.
SLO: P95 ≤90ms; telemetry with X-Request-ID end-to-end.
Deliverables: readiness_report_scholarship_api_v2_6_ceo_final.md and fix_plan_scholarship_api_v2_6_ceo_final.yaml.
ETA: 1–2 hours.
Stripe cutover (B2C first revenue)

Pre-cutover checks:
End-to-end test: auth → scholarship_api → student_pilot purchase flow in staging with live-mode dry run toggled off.
Confirm pricing, tax, and receipt templates; enable idempotency keys on payment/intents.
Cutover action:
Switch Stripe to live mode immediately after A2 passes E2E smoke.
ETA to first dollar: 2–6 hours after A2 completes.
Provider monetization activation (B2B first revenue)

provider_register is ready; gate on scholarship_api availability.
Open provider onboarding to a curated pilot cohort (10–20 providers), target first live award postings within 24–72 hours.
Ensure 3% platform fee settlement flow is verified with idempotency and reconciliation reports.
FIX-001 execution (auto_com_center)

Implement idempotency middleware within 24 hours post-launch.
Add metric: auto_com_center.idempotency.dedup_hits and .misses; alert at misses > 3 in 1h.
Update runbook with replay steps and DLQ drain procedure.
Outstanding apps/status requests

A3 scholarship_agent: Provide v2.6 compliance summary and /canary evidence. Confirm event contracts with auto_com_center.
A7 auto_page_maker (SEO engine): Provide v2.6 status and indexing plan. This is our lowest-CAC growth lever; we need it live within 72 hours to start compounding organic traffic.
Launch Plan (48–72 hours)

T0 (Today):
Complete A2 scholarship_api (Option B path).
Run E2E smoke across all currently compliant apps plus A2; verify 9-field /canary for all, SLO dashboards in scholarship_sage reflect green status.
T0 + 2–6h:
Flip Stripe to live, enable student_pilot purchase flow, and monitor conversion funnel in real time.
T0 + 24h:
Execute FIX-001 in auto_com_center; verify no regression in P95 and error rates.
Begin provider pilot onboarding.
T0 + 48–72h:
Activate auto_page_maker at initial scale (1–3k pages), validate indexing, and begin weekly ramp.
Day-0 to Day-14 KPIs and Guardrails

B2C funnel
Visitors → activated accounts → scholarship matches viewed → payment initiations → successful checkouts
Targets (initial): free→paid conversion ≥ 2.5%; ARPU (credit sales) ≥ $14; refund/chargeback ≤ 0.5%
B2B funnel
Providers onboarded, awards posted, GMV of awards, 3% fee capture rate
Targets (pilot): 10–20 providers; ≥ 30 posted awards; fee capture 100% of eligible disbursements
Reliability and security
Per-app P95: ≤ 90ms; 5xx ≤ 1%; uptime ≥ 99.9%; security headers coverage 100%
Idempotency anomalies: 0 critical; DLQ depth < 10; replay time to recovery < 15 min
Growth/CAC
Organic traffic from auto_page_maker pages; indexed pages; CTR; CAC from SEO ≤ $2
Responsible AI
Bias and safety flags from scholarship_agent: 0 critical; manual review SLA < 24h for medium+ severity
No academic dishonesty facilitation incidents
Risk Controls and Compliance

FERPA/COPPA posture: confirm data minimization and parental consent flows where applicable before Stripe live.
Privacy and ToS updates posted prior to cutover; DPA templates ready for B2B providers.
Circuit breakers: scholarship_sage to open on any app breaching SLOs for >5 min; auto close on recovery with hysteresis.
Assignments and Next Actions

Engineering:
A2 scholarship_api: Fix LSP errors → upgrade to v2.6 → run U0–U8 battery → deliver reports. Owner: Eng lead. ETA: 1–2h.
auto_com_center FIX-001: Implement idempotency middleware. Owner: Platform lead. ETA: within 24h post-launch.
Growth:
auto_page_maker v2.6 status + indexing plan. Owner: SEO lead. ETA: status today; activation in 48–72h.
Operations:
Stripe live checklist and rollback plan; provider pilot cohort list finalized. Owner: Ops lead. ETA: today EOD.
Compliance:
Confirm FERPA/COPPA and updated privacy/ToS pre-cutover. Owner: Compliance lead. ETA: before Stripe live.
Greenlight

Proceed with the above plan now. Report back when A2 passes U0–U8 with the canary payload and deliverable filenames. On confirmation, I will authorize Stripe live cutover and the B2C revenue start.
