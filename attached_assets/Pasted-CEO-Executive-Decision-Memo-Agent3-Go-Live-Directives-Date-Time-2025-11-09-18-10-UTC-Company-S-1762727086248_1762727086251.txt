CEO Executive Decision Memo — Agent3 Go‑Live Directives
Date/Time: 2025-11-09 18:10 UTC
Company: Scholar AI Advisor (www.scholaraiadvisor.com)

Executive decisions (effective immediately)

Fallback sending subdomain: mail2.scholaraiadvisor.com is approved for transactional email deliverability.
Ownership and access
Deputy Ops (DNS): Owns DNS updates for mail2.scholaraiadvisor.com. Add SPF, DMARC, and both Postmark DKIM CNAMEs immediately upon receipt.
Email Ops (Postmark): Owns adding mail2.scholaraiadvisor.com in Postmark, retrieving DKIM CNAMEs, and confirming “Verified” status.
Finance: Owns Stripe PASS gate (test mode/keys, webhooks, KYC/verification). No charging until PASS + CEO GREEN.
T0 definition for deliverability: Postmark shows “Verified” on mail2.scholaraiadvisor.com and DNS records resolve globally (SPF/DMARC/DKIM).
Pre-soak: Proceed 20:00–21:00 UTC under guardrails. Evidence due 21:30–22:00 UTC.
No outbound comms or charging until: Deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS + CEO GREEN. Freeze remains in effect.
DNS and email policy (to be implemented by Deputy Ops + Email Ops)

SPF (root and subdomain): v=spf1 include:spf.mtasv.net -all
DMARC (org and subdomain policy; strict alignment): v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@scholaraiadvisor.com; aspf=s; adkim=s; pct=100
DKIM: Use the two Postmark-provided CNAME selectors for mail2.scholaraiadvisor.com upon domain add; confirm alignment with From and Return-Path.
Return-Path: Align on mail2.scholaraiadvisor.com to ensure SPF/DMARC alignment.
Deliverability T+90 certification window

Start: At T0 (DNS/Postmark Verified)
T+0–T+45: Propagation and Postmark verification monitoring
T+45–T+75: Seed inbox tests (Gmail x2, Outlook x2, Yahoo, Proton, iCloud)
Target: ≥90% inbox placement, transactional not in Promotions (>90%); <0.3% bounces; zero blocklist hits; SPF/DKIM/DMARC PASS and alignment
T+75–T+90: Evidence bundle assembly
T+90–T+105: Post evidence to Master Evidence Index; request CEO review
Hard deadline for GREEN/RED call: 22:30 UTC today unless T0 slips. If T0 slips, GREEN/RED due within 105 minutes of T0.
Gate acceptance criteria (unchanged)

Platform SLOs: 99.9% uptime; P95 ≤120 ms service-side (≤200 ms E2E); error rate ≤0.1%
Auth: PKCE correctness and immediate token revocation proof; request_id lineage across scholar_auth → scholarship_api → app; no PII in logs (FERPA/COPPA)
Responsible AI: Controls active; fairness telemetry on
Financial: Stripe PASS (test transactions, webhooks, KYC verified or scheduled); freeze on charging until CEO GREEN
Assignments and next steps

Email Ops: Add mail2.scholaraiadvisor.com to Postmark now; return DKIM CNAMEs to Deputy Ops within 10 minutes of add.
Deputy Ops (DNS): Publish SPF/DMARC immediately; add both DKIM CNAMEs upon receipt. Signal T0 to Agent3 the moment Postmark shows Verified.
Agent3: Execute pre-soak 20:00–21:00 UTC and deliver T+30 evidence bundle by 21:30–22:00 UTC. Stand by to execute the deliverability T+90 runbook immediately upon T0 and deliver evidence within +15 minutes of completion.
Section V status reports (Agent3’s assigned applications)

APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

What’s missing: Three gates outstanding — Deliverability GREEN (auto_com_center), Stripe PASS (Finance), Pre-soak PASS (tonight).
Blockers
Deliverability GREEN depends on T0 DNS/Postmark verification and T+90 certification.
Stripe PASS pending Finance confirmation of keys, webhooks, KYC/verification.
Estimated Go‑Live Date/Time
Primary: Nov 11, 16:00 UTC
Conditional: Nov 12, 16:00 UTC if a single gate slips ≤24h with mitigation
ARR ignition
B2C ignition: Begins within 24–48 hours post go‑live, contingent on Deliverability GREEN and Stripe PASS (target: Nov 12–13).
Third‑party dependencies and status
scholar_auth: Healthy; watch token cleanup; non‑blocking.
scholarship_api: Pre‑soak participant; must meet P95 ≤120 ms, no‑PII logs, request_id lineage.
Postmark (via auto_com_center): Pending T0/T+90.
Stripe: Pending PASS; no charging until CEO GREEN.
Evidence commitments (tonight, 21:30–22:00 UTC)
P50/P95 histograms (service/E2E), uptime, error tallies, PKCE + revocation proof, request_id lineage samples (10+), no‑PII log validation, executive PASS/FAIL.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

What’s missing: DNS fallback domain setup and Postmark domain verification (T0), then T+90 deliverability certification.
Blockers
Requires Postmark account access to add domain and retrieve DKIM.
Requires DNS admin to publish SPF/DMARC/DKIM for mail2.scholaraiadvisor.com.
Seed inbox accounts access for live testing (Gmail x2, Outlook x2, Yahoo, Proton, iCloud).
Estimated Go‑Live Date/Time
If T0 by 19:30 UTC: GREEN/RED by ~21:15–21:30 UTC.
If T0 after 20:30 UTC: GREEN/RED due within 105 minutes of T0; absolute latest acceptable tonight is 23:59 UTC unless CEO waives.
ARR ignition
Enables compliant transactional and onboarding communications required for B2C conversion. ARR contribution starts when student_pilot goes live and charging is unfrozen (post-CEO GREEN).
Third‑party dependencies and status
Postmark: Pending domain add and verification.
DNS provider: Pending SPF/DMARC/DKIM.
Blocklist monitoring: Required during T+90.
Evidence commitments
DNS record proofs, ESP verification screenshots, seed inbox headers, placement/bounce/blocklist analysis, DMARC policy confirmation, executive GREEN/RED call, posted within 15 minutes of T+90 completion.

Risk controls and rollback

Any breach of guardrails triggers immediate rollback and a 60‑minute RCA with corrective actions and a retest plan.
Communications freeze remains until CEO GREEN; all evidence must be posted on time.
Agent3: Confirm receipt of this memo, then

Post the two Section V reports above verbatim to the Master Evidence Index within 15 minutes,
Start pre‑soak at 20:00 UTC and deliver the T+30 bundle by 21:30–22:00 UTC, and
Execute the deliverability T+90 run once T0 is signaled and post the evidence within +15 minutes.
Deputy Ops and Email Ops: Execute DNS and Postmark steps now and signal T0 the moment Postmark shows Verified.

We will not miss the window. Evidence first. Guard the gate.
