Acknowledged. As CEO, I’ve reviewed the Operation Synergy reports and current ecosystem status. Here are my executive decisions, orders, and timelines to reach Full Operational Capability while protecting our SLOs and revenue plan.

Executive summary

Current state: YELLOW (apps GREEN, comms infrastructure RED due to heap pressure at auto_com_center)
Critical path to FOC: Two gates in parallel
Gate A: provider_register OAuth unblock + smoke evidence → unlocks student_pilot Phase 1 monetization (10%)
Gate B: auto_com_center canary GREEN → coordinated DRY-RUN with scholarship_agent → CEO PASS → production fan-out
Immediate objective: Clear both gates within the next operational window without breaking freeze discipline or SLOs
CEO orders and SLAs

Order A (scholar_auth → provider_register)
Action: Deliver OAuth client credentials to provider_register via approved secure channel
Payload: client_id, client_secret, redirect_uris, scopes (openid, profile, email, offline_access), Provider role, PKCE S256 enforced
SLA: 15 minutes from receipt of this order
Success criteria: provider_register confirms receipt; token exchange validated against JWKS; role=Provider present in JWT
2. Order B (provider_register)

Action: Execute PKCE verification + B2B smoke test against scholarship_api
Deliverables (evidence bundle ≤25 minutes after Order A delivery):
HAR of end-to-end auth (code+PKCE+token exchange)
JWT sample (redacted) with Provider role, exp/iss/aud claims
JWKS validation log from scholar_auth
RBAC proof: provider can only access own org/scholarships
Create/update scholarship listing → persisted in scholarship_api with 2xx; fetch verified
SHA256 manifest of artifacts
Decision: Pre-approved GO upon evidence receipt; you may proceed to production usage immediately after CEO ack (target T+25 to T+30)
3. Order C (Comms Infrastructure Team → auto_com_center)

Action: Resolve heap pressure (current 96.3% > 85% threshold) as Sev-1
Playbook: Horizontal scale out of consumers, memory headroom + GC tuning, rolling restart with health-checks, autoscaling guardrails, heap dump snapshot for root cause (post-mortem later; no freeze break)
SLA: 60 minutes to GREEN (heap ≤85%, error rate <0.1%, canary health passing)
Escalation: If not GREEN by T+60, page SRE on-call and open war-room bridge; provide revised ETA within 10 minutes
4. Order D (scholarship_agent + auto_com_center) – DRY-RUN launch upon GREEN

Launch window: T+5 minutes after canary GREEN
Parameters: 30,000 msgs at 500/min for 120 minutes; request_id correlation end-to-end
Pass criteria: P95 ≤120ms, failures <0.1%, DLQ=0, unsubscribe/opt-out <5s honored for test cohort, standardized errors, circuit breakers remain closed
Abort conditions: P95 >150ms for ≥3 consecutive minutes, failures >0.2%, any DLQ growth
Evidence bundle (≤30 minutes post-run) – both services:
Time-series of P50/P95 latency, error rate, throughput
Circuit breaker logs and state transitions
Opt-out compliance proof and delivery confirmations
Event schema validation and request_id trace sample from producer → consumer
Consumer lag metrics and queue depth graphs
SHA256 manifest of all artifacts
5. Order E (student_pilot) – phased monetization

Trigger: provider_register = GO
Phase 1: 10% traffic within 5 minutes of GO; guardrails for 24h
Roll-forward gates (require DRY-RUN PASS + stable 24h metrics):
Phase 2 (50%): CVR within ±10% of baseline forecast; payment success ≥98.5%; 5xx <0.2%; auth success ≥99.5%
Phase 3 (100%): Same thresholds sustained 24h; no critical incidents
Rollback: Any guardrail breach for 15 consecutive minutes → auto rollback one phase and open incident
Risk controls and compliance

Message durability: For DRY-RUN we will accept “no DLQ growth” posture. Post-FOC, schedule a hardening epic to add DLQ + replay, idempotency keys, and backpressure governance. Do not break freeze before FOC.
Privacy/compliance: Confirm CAN-SPAM/GDPR unsubscribe proofs in evidence; maintain FERPA/COPPA alignment (data minimization, purpose binding).
Security posture: Maintain HTTPS/TLS everywhere, centralized auth (scholar_auth), standardized JSON errors, and frozen schemas until FOC.
Lifecycle and revenue cessation targets (planning baselines)

Infrastructure (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center): Plan for major refresh/replacement by 5–7 years. Target: Q4 2031 readiness for next-gen auth/queue stack; contingent on standards evolution beyond OAuth 2.x and scale demands.
User-facing (student_pilot, provider_register): Plan redesign/replatform in 3–4 years. Target: Q2 2029, driven by UX trends, accessibility, and conversion optimization.
Intelligence/automation (scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker): Plan model/logic replacement in 2–3 years. Target: Q4 2027–Q2 2028, driven by rapid AI capability shifts and SEO algorithm changes.
KPI linkage to 5-year plan

Near-term KPIs unlocked by these gates:
B2C: Free→paid conversion, ARPU from credits; track student_pilot funnel with auto_page_maker SEO traffic
B2B: Active providers onboarded via provider_register; 3% platform fee revenue
CAC: Maintain low-CAC growth via SEO pages; protect CWV and indexation
SLOs: 99.9% uptime; ≤120ms P95 end-to-end on comms path during DRY-RUN and production fan-out
Capital allocation remains focused on organic growth levers and messaging reliability post-FOC
Readiness decisions (effective immediately)

scholar_auth: GO. Execute Order A now.
provider_register: CONDITIONALLY GO upon evidence; execute Order B.
scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker, student_pilot: GO under current constraints and freeze discipline.
auto_com_center: YELLOW pending Order C. No production fan-out until DRY-RUN PASS.
Next milestones and timeline

T+0: This memo issued
T+15: Order A complete (scholar_auth → provider_register)
T+25 to T+30: Order B evidence received; CEO ack; provider_register = GO; student_pilot Phase 1 monetization starts within 5 minutes
T+60: Comms infra canary GREEN due
T+65: Order D DRY-RUN launch
T+185: DRY-RUN complete; T+215: evidence bundles delivered
T+225: CEO PASS/FAIL and production fan-out authorization; upon PASS, Full FOC declared
Accountability summary

student_pilot DRI: Order E owner
CEO: Evidence review, PASS/FAIL, and production fan-out authorization
If any team anticipates missing its SLA, escalate immediately with a mitigation plan and revised ETA. Act with urgency; our 5-year revenue target depends on clearing these gates while safeguarding student value and platform reliability.
