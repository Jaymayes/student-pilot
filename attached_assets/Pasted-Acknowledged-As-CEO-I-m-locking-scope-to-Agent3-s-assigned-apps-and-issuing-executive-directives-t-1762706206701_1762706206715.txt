Acknowledged. As CEO, I’m locking scope to Agent3’s assigned apps and issuing executive directives to remove blockers and protect the launch window.

APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

Blockers:

Pre-soak evidence gate (scheduled 20:00–21:00 UTC Nov 9)
Deliverability GREEN (dependency: auto_com_center + Postmark domain verification)
Stripe PASS (live-mode webhooks, retries, signatures, idempotency)
Estimated Go-Live Date:

Soft launch target: Nov 11, 16:00 UTC (contingent on gates)
ARR Ignition:

Earliest window: Nov 11–12 (credit sales with 4x markup; low-CAC SEO)
Third-Party Dependencies:

scholar_auth (OIDC/PKCE)
scholarship_api (data)
Postmark (transactional comms via auto_com_center)
Stripe (payments)
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

Blockers:

DNS_READY signal from Deputy Ops to verify domain for Postmark (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
Estimated Go-Live Date:

If DNS_READY posted promptly: GREEN at T+90 from T0 (verification), no later than Nov 10, 14:00 UTC (contingency)
ARR Ignition:

Indirect but critical gate for both B2B (provider_register) and B2C (student_pilot) activation and lifecycle comms
Third-Party Dependencies:

Postmark (deliverability infrastructure)
DNS provider (record control/propagation)
CEO DIRECTIVES — IMMEDIATE

DNS_READY escalation (auto_com_center)
Deputy Ops: Post DNS_READY by 17:30 UTC today. Include:
Subdomain: mail.scholaraiadvisor.com (or pre-approved interim)
SPF TXT: v=spf1 include:spf.mtasv.net -all
DMARC TXT: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@scholaraiadvisor.com; aspf=s; adkim=s; pct=100
DKIM CNAMEs (to be supplied immediately by Agent3 after domain add in Postmark)
MX (if using inbound; otherwise omit)
Evidence required: screenshot or dig/NS lookup output proving records present; start T0 at first successful DKIM verify in Postmark.
If DNS_READY not posted by 17:30 UTC: Ops escalation to CTO; alternate subdomain pre-provisioning authorized tonight, with same records, to preserve Nov 10 14:00 UTC GREEN deadline.
2. Deliverability T+90 execution (Agent3)

On T0: Add domain to Postmark, return DKIM CNAMEs to Ops, monitor propagation, then run seed inbox tests (Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo/Proton/iCloud).
Success criteria for GREEN:
From/Return-Path/SPF alignment and DKIM pass
DMARC policy p=quarantine confirmed
Seed inbox placement ≥90% inbox, ≤10% Promotions for Gmail on transactional templates
Bounce rate on seed <0.3%, zero blocklists
Post evidence bundle to Master Index within 15 minutes of completion.
3. Stripe PASS deadline (COO/Finance)

Deadline: 19:00 UTC today for PASS or written ETA with mitigation.
Required evidence (live mode, $0.50–$1.00 test charge permissible):
Webhook reliability ≥99% with signature verification and retry handling
Idempotency keys proven under replays
Refund flow exercised end-to-end with credit ledger updates
SCA/3DS challenge path validated (where applicable)
Error mapping UX verified (no dead ends)
No external charging in student_pilot until Stripe PASS is posted.
4. Pre-soak go/no-go (All DRIs, Agent3 for student_pilot and auto_com_center)

Proceed with 20:00–21:00 UTC internal pre-soak.
Pass criteria during window:
Uptime ≥99.9%
P95 latency ≤120ms (≤200ms end-to-end cross-app)
Error rate ≤0.1%
request_id lineage present across auth → API → app
PKCE correctness and immediate revocation proof
T+30 evidence bundles due by 21:30–22:00 UTC. If any criterion fails, invoke rollback and publish RCA by +60 minutes.
5. Communications and charging gates (Brand protection)

Maintain freeze on external comms and payments until both gates are GREEN:
Deliverability GREEN (auto_com_center)
Stripe PASS
Auto Page Maker remains frozen/monitor-only through Nov 12; daily KPI rollups continue.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND ETHICS CHECKS

FERPA/COPPA: Confirm no student PII in logs; redaction verified during pre-soak.
Responsible AI: Scholarship recommendations must avoid bias; maintain auditability and ensure no academic dishonesty enablement. Scholarship Agent remains observe-only until post-launch review.
KPI GUARDRAILS FOR SOFT LAUNCH READINESS

Technical SLOs: ≥99.9% uptime, P95 ≤120ms, error ≤0.1%
Deliverability: ≥40% open rate target on activation emails; seed placement ≥90% inbox
Activation: ≥35% first-session activation (first document upload or equivalent)
Payments: Authorization success ≥95%; refund success 100% for test cases
CAPITAL AND RESOURCING

Approved: Additional Ops time today for DNS propagation monitoring and verification.
Approved: Postmark throughput scaling and template QA as needed for T+90.
Not approved: Vendor switch for email; stay the course with Postmark unless seed placement <80% inbox after two remediation attempts.
REPORTING CADENCE

DNS_READY confirmation: Immediately upon completion; CEO channel ping mandatory.
Pre-soak start notification: 20:00 UTC; completion + T+30 evidence by 21:30–22:00 UTC.
Deliverability GREEN evidence: Within 15 minutes of T+90 completion.
Stripe PASS: 19:00 UTC today, or provide ETA and contingency.
DECISION TREE FOR NOV 11, 16:00 UTC SOFT LAUNCH

Go if: Pre-soak PASS + Deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS are all met with evidence.
Conditional go (24h slip to Nov 12): One gate red but remediated within 24h and risk accepted with mitigation.
No-go: Any gate unresolved or evidence missing; preserve brand trust and SEO flywheel.
Agent3, proceed per above. Deputy Ops, post DNS_READY by 17:30 UTC. COO, deliver Stripe PASS by 19:00 UTC or provide ETA with mitigation. I will be on-call for any go/no-go decisions and risk exceptions.
