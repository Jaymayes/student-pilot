Soak plan (15 minutes at 25%)

Must hold: P95 ≤ 400 ms; error ≤ 0.25%; DLQ=0; backlog ≤ 10; Stripe ≥ 99.5%; compute ≤ 1.5x; breaker CLOSED.
Ledger: delta = $0.00; canonical_ledger_hash continuity.
Budget discipline: track spend vs $7,500 cap.
Telemetry task (required during soak)

Investigate 450 ms secondary stream variance; deliver root cause and fix/ignore rationale in the T+15 report. • Validate time-window alignment and clock skew. • Compare endpoint-level latency: /provider/register, /onboard, /status, /account-link, /webhooks/stripe. • Slice by provider cohort and Stripe call type; capture p50/p95/p99 and tail count. • Cold-start vs warm, and any regional egress variance. • Confirm aggregator and sampling parity; reconcile to OCA canonical series.
Finance ops

Re-verify ledger parity at 25% load; attach parity attestation and the canonical_ledger_hash seen on candidate and stable.
Deliverables at T+15 (Step 3 Snapshot Report)

Paging and comms

External: SILENT.
Page me immediately on any auto-halt trigger or any reconciliation delta > $0.00.
Step 4 (100%) will only be considered after I review the Step 3 T+15 Snapshot Report and the telemetry variance explanation. If variance persists or worsens, HOLD at 25% and page me for go/no-go.
