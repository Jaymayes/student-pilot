Executive decisions and orders

Prime-directive alignment: We will prioritize organic SEO growth, a frictionless student experience, and a lean, data-driven launch path to reach profitable ARR. Gate A/B approvals today are focused on de-risking auth, observability, SEO flywheel, and messaging deliverability without introducing monetization friction prematurely.

Gate A — Auth chain decision: GO NOW Basis: scholar_auth presented RFC 8414 discovery, JWKS, PKCE S256 mandatory, RBAC, rate limits, and healthy /health with sub-120ms P95 in burst tests. Decision:
Approve OAUTH GREEN.
Order provider_register to begin “Order B PASS” immediately with 25-minute SLA.
Conditions:
Complete webhook HMAC verification before enabling any production webhooks. Infra: deliver WEBHOOK_SECRET immediately.
Continue PII redaction and 10% Sentry sampling; no changes to sampling until Gate B completes.
2. Infra DRI — unblockers and deadlines
Hard requirements to remove current blockers (execute immediately):

SENTRY_DSN (all 8 apps): deliver NOW. If production DSN not ready by T+15 min from this message, all apps are authorized to use staging DSN per Contingency A; swap to production DSN within 24 hours with no code changes.
Messaging stack (auto_com_center):
Provision AWS SQS + DLQ and confirm IAM policy and queue URLs NOW.
DNS: Set SPF, DKIM, DMARC for mail.scholaraiadvisor.com NOW; confirm propagation checks passing before any real send.
Secrets: Postmark and Twilio credentials to secrets manager NOW. A2P 10DLC remains observe-only until registration is complete.
WEBHOOK_SECRET for scholar_auth: deliver NOW.
Escalation: If any item is not delivered within 15 minutes, page the CEO and switch to Contingency Path A (sandbox queues and ESP test mode), metrics-only, no real recipients.

3. auto_com_center — Gate B posture: PROCEED (staging), PRODUCTION DRY-RUN conditional

Proceed with staging validation immediately (Postmark sandbox only). No production sends until DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) confirmed and signed test passes.
Production DRY-RUN authorization: Conditional GO once Infra confirms DNS/credentials. Maintain success criteria:
≥99% delivery, P95 ≤120ms across worker pipeline, <0.1% failure, DLQ=0, unsubscribe SLO <5s.
Keep observe-only mode for Twilio until A2P 10DLC is approved.
4. provider_register — Order B: GO NOW

Execute the 25-minute timeboxed run:
Verify OAuth flows (PKCE, JWKS kid match), Provider RBAC, listing CRUD via scholarship_api, request_id correlation.
Evidence bundle to e2e/ with P95 ≤120ms, error rate <0.2%.
3% provider fee stays behind feature flag (disabled) until Monetization Gate is opened post-Gate B stabilization.
5. scholarship_api — Order 4 readiness: APPROVED

Upon provider_register PASS, proceed. Maintain:
P95 ≤120ms for reads, ≤150ms for writes; error rate <0.1%.
Trigger auto_page_maker on listing activation with request_id continuity.
Data store decision:
Interim acceptance of Neon PostgreSQL for MVP.
Plan RDS Postgres (primary + read-replica) cutover by Dec 2. Zero-downtime migration plan due in 72 hours.
6. auto_page_maker — Order 4: ARMED; EXECUTE ON TRIGGER

Deliver +2 pages (2,101 → 2,103) within 60s of scholarship_api trigger.
Push IndexNow, update sitemaps, and provide CWV p75 evidence (LCP ≤2.5s, CLS ≤0.1, INP ≤200ms).
Confirm no P95 regression after Sentry activation (baseline ~100ms; ceiling 120ms).
This is core to our low-CAC flywheel. Treat any regression as a stop-and-page event.
7. scholarship_sage — quality and explainability: CONTINUE; METRICS DUE

Maintain /recommendations/{student_id} P95 ≤10ms (current 1ms is excellent).
Deliver baseline offline metrics within 48 hours:
precision@5 (target initial ≥0.40), coverage of eligible students (≥90%), and planned CTR baseline ≥8% for the first month (measured via student_pilot click logs).
“matchReasons” explainability is required in all responses. Keep observe-only posture (no outbound comms).
8. student_pilot — observability and billing posture

Sentry v10 is approved; keep sampling at 10% with PII redaction on.
Stripe dual-instance rollout stays at 0% until:
Gate B passes + 48 hours of stable SLOs.
We will then authorize 10% live cohort for a 72-hour soak if KPIs hold.
9. Security, compliance, and SLO guardrails (all apps)

Maintain 99.9% uptime, P95 ~120ms ceiling, error rate <0.1%.
FERPA/COPPA: No PII in logs; continue redaction rules.
All apps must expose /health and dependency-aware /ready endpoints.
Enforce RBAC on protected routes; validate scholar_auth tokens on every call.
TLS, security headers, rate limiting as currently configured.
10. Reporting cadence and evidence

During Gate A/B windows:
Every 30 minutes: one-paragraph status posted with mandatory header format (APP_NAME | APP_BASE_URL), current P95, error rate, any SLO breach, and blockers with owner/ETA.
All artifacts to e2e/ with SHA256 manifest; include request_id chains for cross-app events.
11. Monetization gates

Provider 3% fee: remain disabled until Gate B completes and we verify end-to-end SLOs for 72 hours. Target review window: next business day after Gate B.
Student-side premium billing: remain at 0% rollout until after provider fees are stable.
Top risks and mitigations

Messaging deliverability (DNS/A2P): Staged ramp via sandbox and seed lists; no production sends until DNS signs. Twilio observe-only until A2P approval.
Observability overhead: Hold Sentry at 10% sampling; immediate rollback if P95 >120ms for 5 consecutive minutes.
Database scalability: Neon accepted for MVP; RDS migration plan due in 72 hours; read-replica strategy before launch.
Security/webhooks: No production webhooks without HMAC. Infra must deliver WEBHOOK_SECRET now. Audit logs reviewed daily during Gate periods.
SEO regression: If CWV p75 fails or P95 regresses, halt page generation batch and page CEO with traces and rollback plan.
Immediate actions (owners and deadlines)

Infra DRI (NOW +15 min): Deliver SENTRY_DSN (all apps), SQS+DLQ provisioned, Postmark/Twilio creds in secrets manager, SPF/DKIM/DMARC live, WEBHOOK_SECRET delivered. Escalate if late.
provider_register (START NOW): Execute Order B; evidence in e2e/ within 25 minutes.
scholarship_api (ON provider_register PASS): Execute Order 4; maintain SLOs; prep RDS migration plan (due in 72 hours).
auto_page_maker (ON scholarship_api trigger): Execute +2 pages within 60s; publish evidence; watch P95 regression.
auto_com_center (STAGING NOW; PROD conditional): Run staged validation; proceed to production DRY-RUN only after Infra confirms DNS/creds.
scholarship_sage (48 hours): Deliver precision@5, coverage, and CTR plan; continue observe-only.
This is a GO for Gate A and a conditional GO for Gate B pending Infra confirmations. Execute with urgency, maintain SLOs, and post evidence on schedule.
