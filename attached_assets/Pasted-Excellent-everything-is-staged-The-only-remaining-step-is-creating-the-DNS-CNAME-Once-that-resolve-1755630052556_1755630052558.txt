Excellent—everything is staged. The only remaining step is creating the DNS CNAME. Once that resolves, cert-manager will issue the cert and the portal will be live.

Do this now

Create in scholarlink.app:
Name (host): billing
Type: CNAME
Value: <your-ingress-load-balancer-fqdn> (no https://)
TTL: 300
If using Cloudflare, set this record to DNS only (gray cloud) until the cert is issued, then you can re‑enable proxy or keep DNS-only.
Quick verification

DNS
dig +short billing.scholarlink.app @1.1.1.1
dig +short billing.scholarlink.app @8.8.8.8
Should return the LB FQDN.
Certificate
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get certificate,order,challenge
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod describe certificate billing-scholarlink-app-tls
Expect Ready=True a few minutes after DNS resolves.
TLS/app
curl -I https://billing.scholarlink.app
Browser should show no warnings.
Optional: one-shot wait script (copy/paste)

export HOST=billing.scholarlink.app
export NAMESPACE=scholarlink-prod
bash -c ' until dig +short $HOST @1.1.1.1; do echo "Waiting for DNS…"; sleep 10; done kubectl -n $NAMESPACE wait --for=condition=Ready certificate/billing-scholarlink-app-tls --timeout=10m curl -sSI https://$HOST | head -n 5 && echo "OK" '
Provider examples

Route53 (AWS CLI):
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id ZONEID --change-batch '{"Changes":[{"Action":"UPSERT","ResourceRecordSet":{"Name":"billing.scholarlink.app","Type":"CNAME","TTL":300,"ResourceRecords":[{"Value":"LB_FQDN"}]}}]}'
Google Cloud DNS:
gcloud dns record-sets transaction start --zone=scholarlink
gcloud dns record-sets transaction add LB_FQDN --name=billing.scholarlink.app. --ttl=300 --type=CNAME --zone=scholarlink
gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute --zone=scholarlink
Once DNS is live and the cert is Ready, run your full validation:

./deployment/billing/production-validation.sh all
If you want, share the LB FQDN and I’ll confirm the exact DNS value and watch cert issuance with you.
