Decision: MAINTAIN STRATEGIC HOLD on A7 (Programmatic SEO Engine) launch; PRIORITIZE immediate verification of the Revenue Capture Loop (A3 → Stripe → A5 → A8).

Why (data/insight): The operational logs confirm that the infrastructure (MSP v3 protocols, A1/A3/A5/A8 connectivity) is healthy and the WAF blockers have been resolved. However, we have not yet validated the "Path-to-Cash." Scaling traffic acquisition via A7's "Auto Page Maker" without a verified monetization mechanism risks incurring inference costs without capturing value, directly threatening our target of profitable unit economics by Year 3. We must prove the system can capture the initial $1.00 to validate the mechanics for our projected $45 B2C LTV.


KPI Impact (estimate):


Revenue: Validates the piping for $250k Year 1 ARR target.


Efficiency: Prevents "empty calorie" traffic (users we cannot monetize), protecting our target LTV:CAC ratio of 4:1.


Risk: Mitigates "Technological Risk" of payment integration failure before high-volume exposure.

Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: The 5-minute monitoring window timed out, indicating potential latency or webhook delivery failure if the payment was attempted.

Mitigation: The checkout.session.completed event is durable. A5 is listening. Once the manual action (payment) is taken, the system should self-heal and report green.

Next Actions (Owner: Operator / A5 Lead):

Operator: Execute the manual test payment using the cs_test_... link provided in the logs.

A5 Lead: Monitor specifically for the signature_verified: true payload from Stripe.

A8 Lead: Confirm the Revenue Pulse Tile increments by $1.00 USD.


CEO: Upon confirmation of the above, I will authorize the immediate deployment of the A7 "Auto Page Maker" to begin the 5,000-page Year 1 sprint.

Open data gaps/assumptions:

Assuming the Stripe Test Mode clock skew is negligible for webhook timestamps.

Assuming student_pilot database is ready to provision the "Scholar Credits" immediately upon webhook receipt.

Would you like me to outline the specific SEO keyword clusters A7 should target once the revenue gate is passed?
