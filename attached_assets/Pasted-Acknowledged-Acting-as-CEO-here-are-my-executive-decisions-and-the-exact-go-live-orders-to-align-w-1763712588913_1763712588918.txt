Acknowledged. Acting as CEO, here are my executive decisions and the exact go-live orders to align with our $10M ARR plan and low-CAC growth strategy.

Immediate Go/No-Go Decisions

student_pilot (B2C): GO NOW

Action (operator): Click Publish immediately. Return with “PUBLISHED YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ”.
Gate checks (Agent3, <5 min post-publish):
Smoke: auth (401 on protected routes), scholarships feed, credit purchase flow happy-path.
SLOs: P95 ≤120ms, 5xx <0.5%.
Rollback criteria: Any SLO breach sustained >10 minutes or critical checkout error rate >2%. Roll back and report root cause + fix ETA.
auto_page_maker (SEO): GO TODAY (after student_pilot verification)

Approved: Canonicals, schema.org, sitemap, and middleware ordering fixes.
Action (Agent3): Deploy and run Lighthouse on 5 templates (home, scholarships index, category query, category slug, scholarship detail). Target SEO ≥90 each.
KPI gates for Day-1:
Pages generated: ≥50
Indexable URLs in sitemap: 100% of generated
Organic sessions baseline: establish; report daily lift.
provider_register (B2B): CONDITIONAL GO IN 24 HOURS

Prereq: Configure Stripe LIVE keys + webhook secret. Execute $1 live test. Verify 3% platform fee settlement.
Pricing directive (Day-0):
Pay-to-Post: $99/listing for 30 days OR
Subscription: $249/month up to 5 active listings, overage $25/listing
3% platform fee on awards disbursed via our flow (where applicable)
Gate checks: KYC/verification flow, receipts, role-scoped JWT, provider analytics page loads <200ms P95.
auto_com_center (Comms): GO

Approved for production traffic. Keep current rate limits.
Compliance gates: Unsubscribe enforcement, bounce/complaint webhooks, suppression list active. Daily deliverability report with delivery, open, complaint rate.
Non-Blocking Enhancements (Prioritized)

scholarship_sage: Proceed with real-data integration when M2M credentials are ready; not blocking student_pilot go-live.
scholarship_agent: Fix fleet monitoring 404 and scale to 50+ SEO pages; do not block other launches.
KPI Dashboard (report cadence: hourly Day-0, daily thereafter)

B2C funnel:
Organic sessions from SEO
Registration conversion %
Profile completion %
Matches delivered per user
Free→Paid conversion %
ARPU from credits (target 4x AI COGS)
Refund/chargeback rate
B2B funnel:
New provider sign-ups
Paid providers (listing/subscription)
Avg revenue/provider
Take rate (3% platform fee) and settlement timeliness
Platform health:
Uptime (target 99.9%)
P95 latency by app (target ~120ms)
Error rate (<0.5%)
Email delivery rate (≥98%), complaint rate (≤0.1%)
Capital Allocation and Growth Directives

Growth model: Prioritize Auto Page Maker for organic acquisition; no paid spend until SEO ≥90 Lighthouse and consistent indexation for 2 weeks.
Content/SEO scale plan:
Day-1: ≥50 pages live
Week-1: 300–500 pages live, internal linking from category pages, ensure each page links to “Apply Now” in student_pilot.
Pricing validation:
B2C: Start with $10 per 100 credits; monitor conversion and expand A/B tests by Day-7.
B2B: Validate listing vs subscription acceptance; adjust within 30 days based on CAC/LTV.
Risk Register (with mitigations)

Stripe live misconfig: Mitigation—$1 live test and webhook replay test before opening traffic.
Token/CORS misconfig: Mitigation—pre-publish smoke tests across all protected routes; JWKS cache with fallback.
SEO de-indexing regressions: Mitigation—middleware test suite + Lighthouse CI in pipeline; sitemap auto-regeneration check.
Data quality in scholarship_api: Mitigation—schema validation + alerting on ingest errors; nightly sanity checks.
Compliance (FERPA/COPPA/CAN-SPAM/TCPA): Mitigation—template linting, suppression enforcement, and no ghostwriting policy enforced in scholarship_sage.
Required Confirmations and Deliverables

Student Pilot Publish: Operator confirms with “PUBLISHED YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ”.
Agent3 (within 5 minutes post-publish):
Post smoke/SLO report and first-purchase path validation.
Begin 2-hour watch: log any anomalies and first paid student event timestamp.
Auto Page Maker:
Post Lighthouse results for 5 page types and sitemap diff after deploy.
Provider Register:
Post $1 live transaction receipt, fee capture evidence, and webhook delivery log.
Final Note

We will not delay revenue for non-blocking issues. Launch student_pilot now, validate live flows, then ship the SEO scale-up and Stripe live within the next 24 hours.
Act with urgency; confirm the student_pilot publish timestamp so I can hold the team to the post-deploy gates.
