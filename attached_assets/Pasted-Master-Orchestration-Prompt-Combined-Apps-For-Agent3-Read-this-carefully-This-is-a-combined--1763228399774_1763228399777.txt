Master Orchestration Prompt (Combined Apps) — For Agent3

Read this carefully. This is a combined, single prompt for all eight apps. You must only execute the section for your assigned app. Do not modify or act on any other section.

App index with base URLs

scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_api → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_agent → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_sage → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
student_pilot → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
provider_register → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_com_center → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Global rules for all agents (read-only if not your app)

Scope discipline: Only execute the steps for your app’s section. Ignore all other sections entirely.
Evidence-first: All outputs must be placed in an evidence/ directory. Create it if it doesn’t exist.
Mandatory header on every report: The first two lines of each report must be: APP NAME: <your_app_name> APP_BASE_URL: <your_app_base_url>
Required deliverables per app (5 files, all in evidence/):
EXEC_STATUS_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
E2E_REPORT_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
TEST_MATRIX_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
GO_DECISION_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
SECTION<n>COMPLIANCE<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md (use your section number; see below)
Health endpoints: Ensure /health and /readyz exist and respond. If your app supports /version, include it in health verification or create it.
DRY_RUN safety: If your app triggers external actions (email/SMS/payments/data writes), implement and honor DRY_RUN=true by default.
Performance SLO: Target P95 ≤ 120ms, uptime objective 99.9%. Report measured data or explain the method and monitoring plan.
If you cannot complete 100% today:
Provide your best ETA for production go-live, ARR ignition date, and enumerate third-party systems that must be in place. Be specific.
Ethics and compliance: No academic dishonesty features. Ensure privacy, secure auth, scope-based permissions, transparent logging, and bias-safe defaults.
SECTION-7 — auto_page_maker (Agent3 executes ONLY this section)
You are Agent3. Your assigned app is auto_page_maker.
APP NAME: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal for today

Be 100% production-ready and integrated with platform apps by end of day today. If anything blocks completion, produce a precise ETA, ARR ignition date, and list of third-party prerequisites.
Your responsibilities and success criteria

SEO landing engine: Generate, serve, and keep fresh scholarship landing pages to drive organic traffic with near-zero CAC.
Data source: Pull scholarship data from scholarship_api (preferred) or shared DB if that is the current architecture. Document which method you use and why.
Cross-linking: Link each scholarship detail page to student_pilot for “Apply” or “Start” actions to enable conversion.
Crawlability and rich snippets: Provide complete technical SEO fundamentals to maximize indexing, CTR, and rankings.
Step-by-step execution plan (today)

Workspace self-check

Call GET /health at APP_BASE_URL to confirm the service and version.
Confirm the app name is auto_page_maker. If not, stop and output a single-page diagnostic in EXEC_STATUS explaining the mismatch.
Evidence folder and report headers

Create evidence/ if missing.
All five required reports must begin with: APP NAME: auto_page_maker APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Technical SEO and platform integration checklist
Complete and verify each item; document results with concrete evidence, URLs, and command outputs in the E2E report.

sitemap.xml
Exists at /sitemap.xml; includes canonical URLs; update cadence ≤ 24h; include lastmod.
If partial generation, document page counts and the refresh mechanism.
robots.txt
Exists at /robots.txt; allows crawling of public pages; references sitemap.
Canonical tags and hreflang (if applicable)
Each page includes a correct canonical link rel; if multiple locales, include hreflang.
Schema.org JSON-LD
At minimum: Organization, WebSite, BreadcrumbList.
For scholarship detail pages: use an appropriate schema (e.g., FinancialAidScholarship if supported; otherwise, a compatible structured data type).
Internal linking and breadcrumbs
Ensure crawlable linking from listing pages to detail pages; implement BreadcrumbList JSON-LD.
Page-speed targets
Achieve or plan for P95 TTFB ≤ 120ms under normal load. Provide measured figures or synthetic checks. Include a plan if currently above target.
Rendering strategy
SSR is required. SSG/prerender recommended if build/deploy allows. Document which is in place and why.
Content source integration
Confirm live data feed via scholarship_api: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app • Read endpoints for scholarships and filters. • If using a shared DB path, document the rationale and latency benefit.
Conversion path to student_pilot
Each detail page must link to student_pilot: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app • Ensure link includes scholarship_id and any relevant UTM params. • Confirm pages are public and usable without authentication for discovery; auth can occur at the moment of apply.
Analytics and observability
Add server logs for page impressions and template render timings.
Optional: client analytics; if enabled, document privacy and consent approach.
Error tracking: Sentry or equivalent if available; otherwise document fallback.
Security and privacy
No secrets exposed in client.
CSP headers recommended.
CORS allowlist includes platform surfaces that legitimately call your endpoints.
Test plan and execution (build the TEST_MATRIX; log executions in E2E_REPORT)

Functional
GET / returns landing/homepage with correct meta tags.
GET /sitemap.xml renders with ≥ 100 entries (or your current count) and valid XML.
GET /robots.txt returns valid instructions and sitemap reference.
Scholarship listing pages render with pagination, filters, and canonical tags.
Scholarship detail pages render title, description, eligibility, deadlines, canonical, and JSON-LD.
Detail pages contain a visible CTA linking to student_pilot with scholarship_id.
SEO-specific
Verify canonical is self-referential for primary URLs; no duplicate canonicalization.
JSON-LD parses without errors (use a parser or document the JSON).
OG/Twitter meta present for social previews.
Performance
Measure server-side TTFB across 20 pages; compute P95; target ≤ 120ms.
Record cold vs warm performance observations.
Resilience
Simulate temporary scholarship_api latency; page still renders gracefully or uses cached content.
Integration
Validate at least 5 randomly selected scholarships link correctly to student_pilot with intact params.
Deliverables to produce (all in evidence/, with the exact filenames and headers)

EXEC_STATUS_auto_page_maker_<YYYYMMDD>.md • Current status, checklist completion table, and any known risks.
TEST_MATRIX_auto_page_maker_<YYYYMMDD>.md • Catalog of test cases with IDs, purpose, steps, expected vs actual, pass/fail.
E2E_REPORT_auto_page_maker_<YYYYMMDD>.md • Concrete logs, curl commands, Lighthouse or synthetic timing screenshots/metrics, and page URLs tested.
GO_DECISION_auto_page_maker_<YYYYMMDD>.md • Clear GO or NO-GO today. • If NO-GO, specify exactly: – What’s missing – Fix plan and owner – ETA to GO-LIVE – ARR ignition date and rationale
SECTION7_COMPLIANCE_auto_page_maker_<YYYYMMDD>.md • Confirm each item from Section-7 checklist above as PASS/FAIL with evidence. • Include SLO conformance or remediation plan.
Today’s finish line criteria

All five reports exist with correct headers and substantive evidence.
sitemap.xml, robots.txt, canonical tags, and JSON-LD verified on at least 10 random pages.
student_pilot link-outs verified on at least 5 live detail pages.
Measured P95 TTFB reported and within target, or a concrete remediation plan with ETA.
Document how this app contributes to ARR: • Traffic assumptions (impressions from organic search) • CTR to student_pilot • Conversion rate to paid • Resulting monthly and annualized revenue tied to credit ARPU
If anything blocks completion today, produce a precise ETA and ARR ignition date with third-party prerequisites listed.
Third-party systems potentially required (enumerate needs in your reports)

Google Search Console (site verification and sitemap submission)
CDN or edge cache if available (performance)
Sentry or equivalent observability tool
Monitoring/uptime service (99.9% objective)
Optional: Redis cache (if using SSR with caching)
Output format notes

Keep reports concise but evidence-rich. Include URLs, example payloads, and command outputs.
The first two lines of every report must be: APP NAME: auto_page_maker APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
