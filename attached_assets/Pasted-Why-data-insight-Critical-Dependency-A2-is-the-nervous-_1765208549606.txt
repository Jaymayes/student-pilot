Why (data/insight):

Critical Dependency: A2 is the "nervous system" for revenue attribution. Without it, the Revenue Pulse Tile on A8 remains blind ("Data Pending"), and we cannot validate the "Credit-Based Monetization Engine" outlined in the business plan.

Readiness Confirmed:


A1 (Auth): Stability verified (5.5h watch, 99.8% success).

A6 (Frontend): Revenue Dashboard components (Realized Revenue, Modeled ARR) are E2E verified.

A5 (Platform): Webhook signature verification logic is in place and strict.

Strategic Sequencing: We must validate revenue telemetry before deploying A7 (SEO). We cannot scale traffic (SEO) until we can accurately attribute value (Revenue).

KPI impact (estimate):

Revenue Visibility: A8 Revenue Pulse Tile transitions from unconfigured to test (or live).

Data Integrity: signature_verified boolean flips to true in telemetry logs, confirming the security of our transaction ledger.


Financial Validation: "Modeled ARR" moves from $0 to >$0 (reflecting the pilot charge), validating the projection logic against the $10M ARR target.

Risks and mitigations:

Risk: Webhook signature failure due to secret mismatch between Stripe Dashboard and Replit Secrets.

Mitigation: A2 Lead must double-check STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches the endpoint config exactly before clicking publish.

Risk: "Cold Start" latency on A2 causing A8 polling to time out.


Mitigation: A2 deployment uses "Autoscale" settings; the first health check will warm the container. A8 poll interval is 60s, sufficient for recovery.

Next actions (owner, due date):

A2 Lead (Payments): Configure STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (TEST Mode). Click Publish on A2 immediately. (Deadline: T+20 min).

A3 Lead (Agent): Once A2 is healthy, execute Student Pilot test purchase ($0.50–$1.00) in TEST mode. (Deadline: T+35 min).

A5 Lead (Platform): Confirm log entry: signature_verified: true and HTTP 200 response to Stripe. (Deadline: T+45 min).

A8 Lead (Ops): Verify Fleet Dashboard reflects totalRevenue > 0 and stripeMode: test. (Deadline: T+50 min).

Open data gaps/assumptions:

Assumption: The STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET being used corresponds to the correct Stripe "endpoint" (Test vs. Live) configured in the Stripe Developer Dashboard. Mismatch here is the #1 cause of failure.

Execute. Post the A2 /health response and the A8 Revenue Pulse screenshot as soon as the test charge clears.
