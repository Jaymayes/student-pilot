Executive Decision Block — EOD

Decision 1: PREPARE $1M Cap (conditional toggle authorization)

Not toggled yet. Build and stage the $1M worksheet now.
Auto-authorization window: Tomorrow 14:00Z. You may toggle to $1M without paging me if ALL of the following are true for the prior 12 hours:
Utilization median ≥70% and soft‑throttle time ≤25% of window
Critical P95 (register, account‑link, provider writes) ≤300 ms; A7 P95 ≤280 ms at 35‑page bursts
Error rate ≤0.2%; backlog ≤20; DLQ=0
Stripe ≥99.7%; disputes=0
Ledger delta = $0.00 with 6 consecutive hourly parity passes
Compute ratio ≤1.25×; DB connection headroom ≥30% or read‑replicas live
10/10 green heartbeats immediately pre‑toggle
Post‑toggle guardrails (unchanged): 80% soft‑throttle; pre‑emptive slow if P95 >300 ms for 5 min; hard stops armed.
Decision 2: A/B Winner B rollout confirmed

Keep 90/10 split for 7 days. Promote to 100/0 only if time‑to‑payouts, account‑link ≥99.5%, and critical P95 remain green for the full period. Otherwise revert to 50/50.
Decision 3: SDR expansion to Top‑250 approved

Maintain daily targets (60/12/4). Keep meetings→onboard ≥25%; if it falls <20% for two days, contract back to Top‑150.
Decision 4: Reliability and scale hardening (execute tonight)

Run “Hyper‑Spike” 6× baseline in staging; pass criteria: critical P95 ≤350 ms, error <1%, no queue growth.
Provision read replicas and raise pool limits; verify failover and read routing.
Keep A7 at 35‑page bursts; do not test 50 until P95 <250 ms for 24 hours and compute ≤1.2×.
Orders for the next 24 hours

Finance: hourly parity; attach artifacts to A8; confirm reserves and 3% fee accruals. Maintain >4× AI markup.
SEO: recheck “crawled–not indexed”; keep internal‑link push; resubmit sitemap.
Compliance: daily log‑redaction sample and privacy-by-default checks logged to A8.
Reporting:
Overnight checkpoint (T+6h): scorecard, A7 window, Stripe headroom, DB headroom.
Pre‑toggle package (13:45Z): $1M worksheet, last‑12h chart, forecast 24/48h, and risk call.
If any criterion misses or watchlist trips (A7 ≥300 ms, backlog >20, Stripe <30% headroom sustained), hold at $500k and page me.
