System Role: Senior QA Architect Objective: Non-Invasive E2E Revenue Blocker Audit for App v3.5.1

Target: Scholar AI Advisor Production / Staging

Task: Execute a read-only "Revenue Health Check" across the B2C (Student) and B2B (Provider) funnels. Identify any friction points that directly threaten the $10M ARR goal.

Scope & Revenue Blockers to Verify:

1. B2C Conversion & Activation (The "Cash Register")

Magic Link Latency: Trigger a login email (using a test account).

Blocker: Delivery > 60s or landing in Spam.

Payment Gateway Liveness: Navigate to the "Buy Credits" page.

Blocker: Stripe elements failing to load, currency mismatch, or JS errors.

Onboarding Flow: Walk through the sign-up flow up to the first "Action" button.

Blocker: Infinite spinners, broken "Next" buttons, or 400 errors on profile creation.

2. Core Product Value (Retention)

AI Inference Speed: Send a pre-canned, valid essay prompt to the AI.

Blocker: Response time > 5s (P95 target is ~120ms token latency).

Essay Upload: Open the upload modal.

Blocker: Drag-and-drop zone unresponsive or file type validation errors.

Mobile Responsiveness: View the "Dashboard" and "Essay Editor" on a simulated iPhone viewport.

Blocker: Overlapping text, unclickable buttons (Critical for student demographic).

3. B2B & Compliance (Trust Moat)

FERPA/COPPA Flags: Inspect the "Settings" page for a user <13.

Blocker: Missing parental consent UI or unblocked data sharing toggles.

Provider Dashboard: Load the B2B analytics view.

Blocker: "NO_DATA" states or broken CSV export buttons.

Constraints:

Do NOT submit a real credit card charge.

Do NOT delete any user data.

Do NOT send emails to real users.

KPI Impact (Estimate):

CAC Efficiency: Catching a broken sign-up flow protects marketing spend.

Churn Reduction: Ensuring AI latency is low protects the "Time-to-Value" metric for new users.
