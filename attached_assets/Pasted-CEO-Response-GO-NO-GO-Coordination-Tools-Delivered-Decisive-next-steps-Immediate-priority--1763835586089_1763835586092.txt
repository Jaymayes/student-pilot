CEO Response: GO/NO-GO Coordination + Tools Delivered

Decisive next steps

Immediate priority: Verify environment variables and secrets for provider_register and auto_com_center (Stripe live mode + NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET alignment). These are revenue blockers.
Parallel priority: Confirm student_pilot uses pk_live and points to scholarship_api; confirm scholar_auth /verify and JWKS endpoints are reachable; confirm scholarship_api JWT validation and ledger write path.
Gate: Reply with “GO – Checklist complete” once the five confirmations below are true.
Five confirmations required for GO

auto_com_center
NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET set (rotated, never shared in chat)
CORS allowlist includes all ecosystem origins
Smoke test: POST /send-notification from an allowed Origin returns 200
2. provider_register

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = sk_live_…
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = whsec_… from LIVE endpoint
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = pk_live_…
NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches auto_com_center
Webhook URL configured in Stripe (LIVE): https://provider-register-…/stripe/webhook with payment_intent.succeeded + payment_intent.payment_failed
3. student_pilot

VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = pk_live_…
SCHOLARSHIP_API_BASE_URL points to scholarship_api
Checkout route reachable without CORS errors
4. scholar_auth

/verify fast (<120ms P95)
JWKS available: /.well-known/jwks.json
Issuer and audience values aligned across apps
5. scholarship_api

AUTH_JWKS_URL points to scholar_auth’s JWKS
Ledger write/read paths healthy (credits purchase + balance)
CORS allowlist set to ecosystem origins

How to use these

Assign owners per app; each owner fills the env checklist rows for their app and pastes their PSR (four sections exactly) back to you.
When all five confirmations are true and PSRs are submitted, reply “GO – Checklist complete” and run the $1–$10 live purchase. Capture evidence using the template.
KPIs and acceptance criteria

Time-to-first-dollar: ≤60 minutes from GO to evidence bundle
Stripe mode: All keys must be LIVE (sk_live_, pk_live_, whsec_)
Ledger: 1 purchase recorded; credits appear in student_pilot
Notification: Receipt email delivered via auto_com_center
SLOs: Endpoints respond within ~120ms P95; no 5xx in flow
Risk controls and rollback

If any step fails, pause, capture error, and remediate; do not proceed to charge again until fixed.
Rollback by switching provider_register and student_pilot to test keys, and disable LIVE webhook if needed.
What I need from you now

Do you want me to guide verification for provider_register and auto_com_center first, or do you prefer to run all five in parallel with your team using the checklist?
Once ready, reply with: GO – Checklist complete:
✓ NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET rotated and set in auto_com_center + provider_register
✓ Stripe LIVE keys verified (sk_live_, pk_live_, whsec_)
✓ student_pilot points to scholarship_api with pk_live
✓ scholar_auth verify/JWKS reachable
✓ scholarship_api ledger write/read OK
I will then green-light the live purchase test and coordinate evidence capture.
