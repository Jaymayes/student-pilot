CEO WAR-ROOM DIRECTIVE — Operation Integration Day
Date: 2025-11-05 | Time standard: UTC
Prime Directive: Hold path to Dec 16 go-live and ARR ignition; protect SEO flywheel (Auto Page Maker), uphold SLOs (P95 ≤120ms, error <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9%), enforce Responsible AI.

Executive Decisions (GO/NO-GO)

Production: LOCKED. No production traffic until all release gates pass and CEO-controlled ramp is authorized (1% → 5% → 25% → 100%).
Staging: GO, contingent on secrets delivery. Option B (staging IdP) approved to unblock chain.
Observability: Mandatory request_id propagation across all 8 apps; Sentry 10% sampling with PII redaction.
Cross-Functional Critical Path (time-boxed SLAs)

Infra DRI — Secrets & Messaging (T+10 from receipt of this memo)

Deliver per-app SENTRY_DSN
AWS SQS + DLQ credentials (IAM policy/keys)
Postmark (ESP) and Twilio (SMS) secrets
DNS/A2P: SPF, DKIM, DMARC; A2P brand + campaign submissions Escalation: If missed, scholarship_agent triggers auto-escalation immediately.
Auth DRI — Option B Staging IdP (Immediate)

Stand up issuer (Keycloak/Auth0), publish OIDC discovery URL
Configure 7 OAuth clients (3 user-facing + 4 M2M) with claims parity (roles, sub, email, aud, offline_access)
Publish STAGING_IDP_PARITY_EVIDENCE.md
provider_register — ORDER B (20 minutes after issuer live)

Post e2e/reports/provider_register/ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md with PKCE S256 flow, roles=["Provider"], CRUD roundtrip to scholarship_api, P95 ≤120ms, request_id traces
scholarship_api — ORDER 4 (20 minutes after Order B evidence)

Create +2 scholarships, emit scholarship_created events to auto_page_maker and auto_com_center
Post e2e/reports/scholarship_api/ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md (P95 read ≤120ms, write ≤150ms, event emission proof)
auto_page_maker — +2 Pages (within 60s of Order 4 trigger; evidence in 10 minutes)

Post e2e/reports/auto_page_maker/ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md including:
APP_NAME | APP_BASE_URL header
Sitemap diff (+2 pages)
IndexNow receipts
CWV p75 GREEN (LCP, CLS, INP)
P95 ≤120ms
request_id trace links
Guardrail: Any CWV p75 regression >5% → automatic rollback
auto_com_center — Staging Validation (T+30 after secrets)

Run webhook→queue→worker→dispatcher path
Release gates: Unsubscribe SLA <5s and DLQ=0
Post e2e/reports/auto_com_center/staging_validation.md with SLO evidence and trace links
Per‑App Directives and Current CEO Decisions

APP_NAME: scholar_auth | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: GO for Option B staging IdP; primary IdP remains P0 to restore with a true restart mechanism. Requirement before any production unlock: 24h soak with 0 invalid_client.

APP_NAME: scholarship_api | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: GO on Order 4 upon provider_register evidence. Maintain event emission to auto_page_maker and auto_com_center. RDS migration remains Nov 7 22:00 UTC; publish RDS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md by EOD Nov 6 UTC.

APP_NAME: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Service Catalog Attestation accepted. Maintain T+10/T+30/T+50 checkpoint enforcement; auto‑escalate if Infra misses secrets SLA. Keep request_id correlation board live.

APP_NAME: scholarship_sage | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: GO observe‑only baseline immediately upon M2M secret receipt. Post baseline_metrics_evidence.md at +48h with precision@5, coverage, matchReasons, fairness. No outbound messaging until CEO clearance.

APP_NAME: student_pilot | APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Stay GREEN on SLOs and WCAG 2.1 AA remediation. Weekly cohort report continues. Hold recommendations UI behind feature flag until scholarship_sage baseline completes and is cleared.

APP_NAME: provider_register | APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: GO for Order B upon issuer live. Evidence due within 20 minutes; then trigger scholarship_api Order 4.

APP_NAME: auto_page_maker | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: GO and ARMED. Execute +2 pages on Order 4; evidence in 10 minutes. Maintain CWV p75 GREEN; >5% regression rollback is mandatory.

APP_NAME: auto_com_center | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: BLOCKED pending secrets and DNS/A2P. Contingency invoked.
Blockers Report (CEO accepted):

Dependencies: SENTRY_DSN, AWS SQS+DLQ, Postmark, Twilio, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, A2P brand/campaign.
Realistic ETA for staging validation: Nov 6, 2025, 14:00 MST (on secrets delivery by Nov 6, 09:00 MST).
Revenue readiness date (ESP/SMS production messaging): Nov 12, 2025 (contingent on A2P approval SLAs). Requirement: No production messaging until Unsubscribe SLA <5s and DLQ=0 are evidenced.
Evidence-First Requirements (applies to every artifact today)

Include APP_NAME and APP_BASE_URL in header
Include request_id trace links end‑to‑end
Publish artifacts to e2e/reports/<app>/<artifact>.md
SLO proofs: P95 latency, error rate, uptime snapshots
Security: 6/6 headers, RBAC, JWKS validation, rate limiting where applicable
Responsible AI: For scholarship_sage outputs, include matchReasons and fairness notes; never facilitate academic dishonesty
KPIs to Report at Close of Day (single dashboard snapshot)

B2C funnel: activation rate, application conversion, ARPU (credits)
B2B funnel: active providers, active listings, time‑to‑first‑listing
CAC: organic share vs paid (target: organic majority via Auto Page Maker)
Platform: P95 latency, error rate, uptime, SEO CWV p75
Communications: unsubscribe SLA, DLQ depth (target zero), send/deliver rates (staging)
Final Notes

Production remains LOCKED until all release gates pass and CEO war‑room authorizes phased ramp.
If any team cannot hit the EOD staging objectives above, stop work and publish a blockers report immediately with ETA and revenue readiness date, per the contingency protocol.
Maintain the SEO flywheel: no actions that risk CWV p75 GREEN. Roll back on >5% regression.
Execute with urgency and ship evidence, not assertions.
