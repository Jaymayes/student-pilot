Executive decision from the CEO of Scholar AI Advisor

Objective alignment
Operation Synergy is approved. Our goal is 100% operational readiness across the ecosystem to unlock revenue milestones with low-CAC organic growth and airtight security. We will proceed with a gated, data-first rollout to protect SLOs (99.9% uptime, ~120ms P95) and regulatory compliance while accelerating time-to-revenue.

Go/No-Go decisions and owners

auto_com_center: GO now (dry-run receive-and-queue). Owner: Comms DRI. SLA: publish in 5 minutes; evidence bundle in 15 minutes.
scholar_auth (Gate 1): Must flip GREEN before any JWT-enforcing services go full active. Owner: Auth DRI. SLA: 60 minutes to restore JWKS + /canary v2.7.
scholarship_api (Gate 2): STANDBY until Gate 1 GREEN. Owner: API DRI. SLA: publish within 30 minutes of Gate 1 GREEN; evidence bundle in 15 minutes post-publish.
student_pilot (Gate 3): STANDBY. Owner: Frontend DRI. Trigger: Gates 1 and 2 GREEN; run E2E smoke within 15 minutes.
scholarship_sage: GREEN. Owner: Sage DRI. Standby for Gate 3.
scholarship_agent: STANDBY. Owner: Agent DRI. Trigger: Gate 2 GREEN, then run ingestion + event tests.
auto_page_maker: STANDBY. Owner: SEO DRI. Trigger: Gate 2 GREEN, then fire landing-page generation webhooks.
provider_register: GREEN. Owner: Provider DRI. Standby for Gate 2.
Single-app execution rule
Each Agent3 instance must only execute its app’s Section 4 tasks. No cross-app publish or config changes. Report status in the war room every 15 minutes or on significant change.

Immediate actions required

Comms DRI (auto_com_center)
Click Publish now (dry-run, DISABLE_SEND=true).
Run quick status at T+5; full verification at T+15 using your prepared scripts.
Post evidence bundle and declare GREEN (receive-and-queue).
2. Auth DRI (scholar_auth) — Gate 1 SLA: 60 minutes

Restore healthy JWKS, confirm /canary v2.7 with security headers, validate /token/refresh.
Post evidence and flip Gate 1 to GREEN.
3. API DRI (scholarship_api) — Gate 2 SLA: 30 minutes after Gate 1 GREEN

Publish v2.7, verify auth middleware on protected routes, and event emissions.
Post evidence and flip Gate 2 to GREEN.
4. Frontend DRI (student_pilot) — Gate 3

When Gates 1 and 2 are GREEN, run E2E smoke, capture P95 and auth flow logs, and post evidence.
Evidence requirements (all DRIs)

Canary v2.7 with 8 fields and 6/6 security headers.
P95 latency baseline with 30-sample run ≤120ms.
Auth path verification (as applicable).
Standardized error handling samples.
Integration checks per Section 4.
Lifecycle analysis per Section 6 (put in Section 7 report).
Mandatory reporting format reminder
Submit Section 7 in the exact format below to the war room. One submission per app.

BEGIN REPORT

APPLICATION IDENTIFICATION
Application Name: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Application Type: Infrastructure

TASK COMPLETION STATUS

Task 4.8.1 (Event Consumption): Status: Complete (dev) / Pending evidence (prod) - Event triggers from scholarship_agent and system sources consumed; receive-and-queue mode enabled in dry-run.
Task 4.8.2 (Delivery System Integration): Status: Complete (dev) / Pending evidence (prod) - SMTP/SMS providers integrated; dry-run active; kill-switch verified.
Task 4.8.3 (Template Rendering and Queue Management): Status: Complete (dev) / Pending evidence (prod) - Templates render with tokenized data; queue configured for durability; rate limit 10 msgs/min.
Task 4.8.4 (Compliance): Status: Complete (dev) / Pending evidence (prod) - Unsubscribe/opt-out wired; CAN-SPAM/GDPR flows verified in dev.
INTEGRATION VERIFICATION

Connection with scholar_auth: Status: Degraded (expected until Gate 1 GREEN) - JWKS/M2M checks run in degraded mode; validation to be re-verified post-Gate 1.
Connection with scholarship_api: Status: Pending (tied to Gate 2) - Event-driven updates to be re-tested after Gate 2.
Connection with scholarship_agent: Status: Verified (dev) - Synthetic events accepted and queued; no external sends in dry-run.
LIFECYCLE AND REVENUE CESSATION ANALYSIS

Estimated Revenue Cessation/Obsolescence Date: Q4 2030
Rationale: As an infrastructure comms hub, primary risks are protocol/provider shifts (email auth standards, carrier filtering, DMARC/BIMI tightening), security posture drift requiring re-architecture, and throughput scaling. Typical infra lifecycle 5–7 years; at current growth and regulatory pace, plan for major rev by 2029–2031.
Contingencies: Earlier if regulatory changes mandate architectural shifts (e.g., consent frameworks) or if provider pricing/API deprecations change economics; later if modularization + provider abstraction continue to meet SLOs and compliance with routine upgrades.
OPERATIONAL READINESS DECLARATION
READY (dry-run, receive-and-queue mode)
Development Server Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL
Evidence (dev):

Canary v2.7: status=ok, 8/8 fields, 6/6 security headers, p95_ms≈10
Messaging: transactional operational in dry-run, idempotency enabled
Kill-switch: DISABLE_SEND=true validated Production publish: Pending DRI click; T+5 quick status, T+15 evidence bundle
END REPORT

SLO, security, and compliance guardrails

P95 latency ≤120ms, 99.9% uptime, 0 P0 security regressions.
Centralized auth only via scholar_auth; no credentials in other services.
Standard error schema across services; all over TLS; CORS restricted to approved frontends.
Responsible AI: no academic dishonesty, explainable recommendations, bias mitigation documented.
Revenue unlock checkpoints

Gate 1 GREEN → enables secure session flows, reduces friction, improves conversion.
Gate 2 GREEN → enables authoritative data/API and event stream for recommendations and pages.
auto_com_center live (dry-run) → starts deliverability baselines and operational telemetry.
Gate 3 smoke pass → opens controlled student onboarding and provider workflows.
Auto Page Maker → accelerates SEO-led, low-CAC acquisition.
War room cadence

Update every 15 minutes or on any gate transition.
Include: app, gate, status, canary version, p95, blocker, next action, ETA.
Final CEO directions

Comms DRI: Publish auto_com_center now and post T+5 confirmation. Do not wait for Gates 1 or 2.
Auth DRI: Resolve JWKS and canary v2.7 within 60 minutes; post evidence; flip Gate 1.
API DRI: Publish within 30 minutes of Gate 1 GREEN; post evidence; flip Gate 2.
All DRIs: Submit Section 7 reports in the mandatory format within your publish window.
Confirm once auto_com_center is published. I will review the evidence bundle immediately and authorize progression to the next gate.
