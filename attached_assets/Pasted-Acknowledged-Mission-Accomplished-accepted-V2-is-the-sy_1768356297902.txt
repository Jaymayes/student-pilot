Acknowledged. Mission Accomplished accepted. V2 is the system of record, revenue flowing, and the Paid Pilot is live under retargeting-only constraints. Excellent work.

90‑day scale plan aligned to $10M ARR

North-star targets (rolling, data-first)

Reliability: ≥99.9% uptime, P95 ≤110ms (≤100ms stretch), error ≤0.5%.
Unit economics: AI gross margin ≥60% sustained; refund ≤5%; chargebacks = 0.
Growth mix: ≥85% organic SEO sessions; paid traffic only as a controlled accelerator.
Dual engine revenue:
B2C credits: ARPU ≥$22 near-term; ≥$28 stretch by Day 90.
B2B provider fees: 3% captured; 150 active providers; ≥500 listings.
Next 7 days (post-cutover stabilization)

Cost governance
Keep rolling 24h spend telemetry visible; auto-throttle rules remain in code. Re-enable background tasks only when projected spend ≤$300 and SLOs green for 4 consecutive hours.
Daily spend report: LLM/API, proxy, storage; include projection and top cost drivers.
Payouts
Continue per-provider $250/day, global $5,000/day, 10% holdback, net‑14 (simulation continues). CFO to approve switching payouts from simulation to LIVE after 7‑day observation with disputes=0 and fraud<0.5%.
V1 retirement
Day 7: archive and revoke all access; produce an auditable checksum + data retention manifest.
Security/Compliance
Privacy mini-audit (COPPA/FERPA posture) post-cutover; confirm 0 PII logs and 100% API-key enforcement samples.
Rotate inter-service keys again at T+48h; verify legacy key denylist.
Paid Acquisition Pilot (72h retargeting-only)

Token already consumed; proceed under strict guardrails you configured.
Daily operating rules
Budget cap: $150/day rolling 24h.
Success to scale: CAC ≤ $8 for a continuous 24h AND 7‑day ARPU ≥ 1.8× CAC AND refunds ≤4% AND Stripe success ≥98.5%. If all true, request budget step-up to $300/day with token CEO-20260114-PAID-PILOT-STEPUP (conditional; orchestrator must enforce those four gates).
Auto-pause: CAC > $12 for continuous 24h OR 7‑day ARPU < $18 OR fraud ≥0.5% OR Stripe success <98.5% for 30 min. Keep SEO-only growth unaffected.
Reporting cadence (pilot)
T+12h and T+24h each day: spend, CAC, ARPU7, conversion funnel (visitor→signup→upload→paid), refund/fraud, and any auto-pauses. Include creative/segment notes.
SEO growth engine (Auto Page Maker)

Weekly goal: +7,500 net pages indexed; maintain CTR tracking and indexed→click ratio.
Quality guardrails: dedupe and thin-content filters; log removals; monitor bounce rate on new clusters.
Funnel and product velocity

First Upload rate (signup→first upload) is the primary lever; set a weekly improvement target of +10% relative.
Verifier quality: keep FP ≤1%; self-correction ≥90%. Ship rubric tuning and model routing as-needed; log all verifier decisions to A8.
Performance workstream (accepted as complete for T+24h)

Keep the 20% P95 reduction targets as a baseline SLO budget. Create a weekly regression report with before/after profiles, cache hit rates, and query plans; rollback on accuracy regression in match.
Finance and forecasting

Daily revenue rollup: B2C net, B2B 3% fees, ARPU, refunds, gross margin.
Reconciliation: Stripe ↔ platform ledger must remain ±$0.
Forecast model: produce a 30/60/90‑day run-rate based on organic SEO trend + conservative pilot uplift; show confidence bands and CAC sensitivity.
Communications

Internal only: note to Support/Provider Ops on payout caps and 10% reserve; SLAs for manual review (≤4h).
External: no promotional messaging during pilot; privacy stance unchanged.
Deliverables I need

Paid Pilot Day‑1 T+12h/T+24h reports.
A 1‑pager each Friday: KPI rollup, incidents (if any), cost posture, SEO growth, funnel deltas, and next week’s experiments ranked by ROI.
Keep the system lean, data-first, and SEO-led. This cutover gives us the operating foundation to compound toward the $10M ARR objective while protecting margin and trust.
