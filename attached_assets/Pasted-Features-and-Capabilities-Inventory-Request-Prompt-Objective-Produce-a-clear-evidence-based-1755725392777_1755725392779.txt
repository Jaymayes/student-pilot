Features and Capabilities Inventory – Request Prompt

Objective

Produce a clear, evidence-based list of all features and capabilities, organized per app (or for a single app if only one is provided). Read-only; no changes.
Scope

apps: {APP_LIST_CSV_OR_BULLETS}
base_urls (optional): {APP_URL_MAP_OR_SKIP}
focus version/env: {ENVIRONMENT_OR_VERSION_TAG}
Inputs (use what is available; skip if absent)

inventory: {INVENTORY_PATH_OR_SKIP} (e.g., ACC_ECOSYSTEM_CAPABILITIES_INVENTORY.md)
openapi/specs: {OPENAPI_DIR_URI_OR_SKIP} (or discover /openapi.json)
qa/ops summaries: {QA_SUMMARY_JSON_URI_OR_SKIP}
observability links: {DASHBOARD_LINKS_URI_OR_SKIP}
Instructions

For each app, enumerate capabilities under the categories below. Cite evidence (doc/spec link, endpoint, or file path). If unknown, mark “unknown” and add a follow-up action.
Keep it concise and skimmable (bullets). No speculation or marketing language.
Per-app categories (use in this order)

Overview and purpose (primary audience, main goal)
Key features and workflows (top user journeys/modules)
API surface (if applicable: major endpoints, methods, auth, pagination, rate limits)
Integrations and communications (webhooks, message bus, external services, cross-app touchpoints)
Security posture (security headers, CSP/CORS highlights, authN/Z approach, secrets handling)
Health, reliability, and performance (health/version endpoints, baseline p95 if known, SLOs)
Observability (log fields, tracing, dashboards, alerts)
SEO/web surface (title/meta/canonical, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, JSON-LD/OG, caching/compression)
Limits and constraints (quotas, size/time limits, platform constraints)
Known gaps or risks (open issues, technical debt, roadmap items)
Evidence and references (links to docs, OpenAPI paths, dashboards, repo files)
Cross-app summary (add after all apps, if multiple)

Capability map (which app provides what)
Key E2E flows and contracts (inputs/outputs, trace continuity)
Security/compliance rollup (headers consistency, SAST/SCA baseline, secret scanning status)
Performance rollup (p95 by app if known, chaos recovery SLOs)
Readiness and next steps
Output format

Return two sections: a) Human-readable: per-app bullet lists using the categories above, then a cross-app summary. b) Machine-readable JSON: apps_capabilities with keys per app and fields matching the categories; include evidence URLs/paths.
Constraints

Read-only; do not trigger mutations or auth flows.
Redact/omit secrets; prefer linking to public docs or inventory entries.
Mark missing data as “unknown” with a specific follow-up (e.g., “Fetch /openapi.json”).
