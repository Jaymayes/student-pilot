Acknowledged. Here’s the tight, executive follow‑through you need now.

A1 post‑publish status (quick read)

Edge now honors s‑maxage=300; public gets overridden to private by the CDN, but s‑maxage is the caching key that matters. Expect p95 to drop across 2–3 probe windows as caches warm. Keep Replit logs/analytics open for confirmation and fast rollback if needed (use the Logs and Resources views to watch latency and spikes; they’re the primary production debugging surface on Replit) .
If you need to tweak headers/rewrites at the edge for discovery/JWKS or www→apex routing, you can set custom response headers and rewrites in deployment config (static/edge layer), not just app code, which can further stabilize latencies and canonicalization .
Cookie posture remains correct (HttpOnly + Secure; cross‑domain identity flows need this) and aligns with session/token best practices .

A7 Google Search Console — critical error triage (fastest path to green)
Use this exact checklist in GSC; paste the error title/details here and I’ll tailor the fix.

Open the error
GSC → Indexing → Pages (or Sitemaps) → click the critical error → “OPEN REPORT”.
Capture the exact error name/file/URL.
2. Confirm basics from production

robots.txt returns 200 OK and is not blocking sitemap or key pages.
sitemap.xml returns 200 OK, valid XML, Content‑Type: application/xml; page URLs use your intended canonical host (apex if www is not configured).
www DNS/redirect: either point www.scholaraiadvisor.com at the apex or 301 redirect www → apex consistently.
3. Common criticals and fixes

“Couldn’t fetch” sitemap: serve application/xml; remove auth/waf on sitemap; ensure file size <50MB or split; re‑submit sitemap in GSC.
“Submitted URL blocked by robots.txt”: update robots to allow crawl of submitted paths; re‑test with “robots.txt Tester”.
“Redirect error” or “URL marked ‘noindex’”: remove noindex from templates; ensure 200/HTML on canonical pages.
“Server error (5xx)”: check Replit logs and resource usage; mitigate cold starts (pre‑warm workflows) and confirm uptime (Replit logs/Workflows are the fast MTTR loop) .
Domain mismatch: if sitemap lists apex but you verified www (or vice versa), align verification with the domain you serve or add both and ensure a single canonical with 301s.
4. Submit and monitor

Re‑submit sitemap after the fix.
Use “URL Inspection → Test live URL → Request indexing” for the top 20–50 pages.
Watch coverage growth and request duration in Replit’s analytics and A8 telemetry (set a quality gate for request duration/latency on the sitemap and top pages) .
What I need from you

Paste the exact GSC critical error text and URL so I can produce a one‑shot fix.
Confirm if you want me to send a second version of the concierge email for follow‑ups at T+24h.
24–48h proof plan (owners)

A1 (Auth): Observe discovery/JWKS p95 ≤150ms for 3 windows; if not, apply edge‑level header rules and confirm via probes (A8). Keep logs/alerts handy; this shortens MTTR on Replit deploys .
A5 (Student): Keep /api/login timings streaming to A8; target p95 ≤200ms, p50 ≤120ms for 24h; gate on “critical happy path” in CI so regressions block deploys (E2E quality gates) .
A3 (Agent): Watch provider CTA clicks (utm_source=scholarship_agent). If <10 in 24h, add a top‑of‑fold CTA variant and A/B copy (per your test plan).
A6 (Provider): Execute concierge outreach to the 3 stuck providers with personalized links; target 2/3 connect completions in 48h.
If you share the GSC error now, I’ll respond with the exact fix (header, robots/sitemap content, or redirect rule) and a verification checklist you can run in under 10 minutes.
