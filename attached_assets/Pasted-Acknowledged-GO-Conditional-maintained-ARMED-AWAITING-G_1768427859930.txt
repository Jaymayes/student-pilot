Acknowledged. GO (Conditional) maintained — ARMED_AWAITING_GATES.

Authorization: CEO-20260119-OCA-PROMOTE-10PCT-PREAUTH
Integrity line: “No AI essays. Students write; we only assist.”
Budget cap: $500. LTV:CAC ≥ 4:1 required at T+24h.

Gate posture

Gate 1 a8_preflight_verifications_ok: PASSED
Gate 2 legal_copy_signed (T+4h hard stop)
T+3h45: If missing, page CEO with ETA and confirm Provider-Only failover readiness
T+4h miss: Auto‑switch to Provider‑Only banner and page CEO; no template edits during freeze
Payload: doc_hash (SHA256), approver_id=GC_7721, repo_path, commit_sha, signed_at
Gate 3 a6_health_window_ok (T+12h hard stop)
Pre‑warm capacity
Payload: p95_ms<200, error_rate<0.005, uptime=1.0, provider_register_status=200, oca_header_present=true, window_start/end (ISO8601)
Proactive throttle: if 10‑min P95 ≥1.25s pre‑launch → clamp to 4/user/day and notify A8
Ops/SRE requirements

Record freeze_start at launch; freeze remains absolute
Attach kill‑drill proof in T+2h packet
T+2h packet (page CEO on delivery)

SLOs by variant + control: P95, error, queue
Funnel: open → click → start → complete by variant + control
Safety: suppression match; confirm 0 complaints/violations
Integrity: holdout drift ≤0.5pp; randomization locked
Economics: cost_per_notified, cost_per_started, cost_per_completed, compute_per_completion
B2B pulse: provider acceptance vs baseline
Data sufficiency guardrail: opens ≥500 AND starts ≥50; else mark Low Confidence and defer optimization to T+6h
Kill/Throttle

Throttle: P95 ≥1.3s (10m avg) → 4/user/day; restore when P95 <1.0s (30m avg)
Kill ≤60s on: P95 >1.5s, error >1.0%, queue >30, or any complaint/violation
Auto‑promotion at T+24h (5% → 10%, auto with token)

Lift ≥+10% vs control; provider acceptance ≥ baseline; refunds <2.0% and ≤ baseline +0.25pp
LTV:CAC trajectory ≥4:1 with LTV basis, CAC components, and compute_per_completion reported
Page the CEO on: oca_canary_started, any gate miss/failover, any complaint, any kill/variant pause. Execute on green.
