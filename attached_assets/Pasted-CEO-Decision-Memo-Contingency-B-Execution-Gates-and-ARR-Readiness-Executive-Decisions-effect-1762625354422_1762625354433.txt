CEO Decision Memo — Contingency B Execution, Gates, and ARR Readiness

Executive Decisions (effective immediately)

Go/No-Go: NO GO for current auth path. Proceed with Contingency B (issuer migration to auth.scholaraiadvisor.com). Cancel tonight’s soak tied to the current issuer; run pre-soak only after migration on Nov 9.
Comms Authorization: Auto Com Center is authorized to broadcast the Infrastructure Intercept message variant now that 18:15 UTC returned RED. Hold the other two variants in reserve for post-migration pre-soak outcomes.
Stripe Gate (B2B): Hard deadline remains 18:00 UTC. Budget up to $500 approved for escalation. If evidence package is not delivered by 18:00 UTC, B2B remains BLOCKED regardless of auth outcomes.
Change Freeze: Maintained across all apps except scholar_auth activities required for Contingency B and config-only issuer updates during the Nov 9 window.
Migration and Validation Plan (authoritative)

Canonical Issuer: https://auth.scholaraiadvisor.com (Cloudflare-fronted)
Change Window: Nov 9, 17:00–19:00 UTC (all relying parties config-only update)
Pre-Soak: Nov 9, 20:00–21:00 UTC (≥500 samples per endpoint; P95 ≤120ms; error ≤0.1%)
Gate: Nov 10, 00:00–00:15 UTC (AUTH GREEN TAG decision window)
Acceptance Criteria (must meet all):
P95 ≤120ms on Discovery, JWKS, authorize, token
Error rate ≤0.1%
Correct issuer end-to-end; OIDC conformance passes
Proper cache headers (ETag + Cache-Control: public, max-age=300)
Request_id lineage through Cloudflare → origin, with 7-day logs
Evidence Required:
RFC-001 OIDC Issuer Migration posted by 21:00 UTC today
Replit P1 ticket ID and Cloudflare provisioning proof
Pre-soak histograms and error tallies; config diffs (redacted)
Revised ARR Timing (unchanged from Agent3 proposal)

B2C (student_pilot): Gate Nov 10; earliest ignition Nov 11 00:00 UTC
B2B (provider_register): Earliest Nov 10 01:30–03:00 UTC if Stripe evidence delivered today and Auth passes Nov 10 gate
Organic (auto_page_maker): Unaffected; continue daily SEO cadence
Per-Application Executive Posture and Orders

Application Name: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: RED (infrastructure-blocked at root Discovery; /oidc path >120ms P95)
Orders:

Execute Contingency B. Publish RFC-001 by 21:00 UTC.
Open P1 with Replit and begin Cloudflare provisioning (per timeline).
Prepare and validate Discovery/JWKS at new issuer with required cache headers.
Deliver pre-soak results Nov 9 and gate readiness artifacts for Nov 10.
Application Name: scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (Frozen)
Orders: No code changes. Prepare config-only issuer switch Nov 9 window; run OIDC conformance and end-to-end token validation with student_pilot and scholarship_sage.

Application Name: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (Frozen)
Orders: Config-only issuer update Nov 9; validate client_credentials M2M flow; enforce read-only scope post-migration.

Application Name: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (Ready/Blocked; Frozen)
Orders: Config-only issuer update Nov 9; full E2E harness run post-update; deliver T+30 evidence after AUTH GREEN TAG.

Application Name: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: AMBER (Stripe evidence pending by 18:00 UTC)
Orders: Maintain freeze except Stripe. Deliver 18:00 UTC evidence package (live key, webhook verified, signed event 200 OK, logs). If at risk, escalate to CFO + Stripe Priority Support now.

Application Name: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (Observe-only)
Orders: Maintain freeze; prep config-only issuer update Nov 9; participate in conformance and E2E token validation.

Application Name: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (Unaffected)
Orders: Maintain freeze; continue 06:00 UTC KPI rollups; no auth dependencies.

Application Name: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN
Orders: Broadcast Infrastructure Intercept + Issuer Migration message now based on 18:15 RED; hold PASS/FAIL variants for post-migration pre-soak outcomes.

Security, Compliance, and SLOs (non-negotiable)

Security: Do not relax issuer correctness, token validation, or revocation semantics. No temporary bypasses.
SLOs: 99.9% uptime and P95 ~120ms remain in force for auth endpoints post-migration.
Compliance: Maintain FERPA/COPPA posture; ensure no PII leakage in logs; redact secrets in evidence.
Executive Checkpoints to CEO

18:00 UTC: Stripe evidence package (Finance/Platform Ops) — send summary and artifacts
19:30 UTC: Confirmation of Replit P1 + Cloudflare provisioning started (Platform Ops)
21:00 UTC: RFC-001 posted; share link and change plan summary (Auth DRI)
Nov 9, 19:15 UTC: Confirm all relying parties updated to new issuer
Nov 9, 20:45 UTC: Pre-soak results and go/no-go for gate
Nov 10, 00:20 UTC: Gate outcome and GREEN TAG issuance, or next-window plan
Rationale tied to Prime Directive

Preserving trust and meeting performance/security bars protects our brand and long-term ARR scalability.
Organic growth via Auto Page Maker continues compounding, preserving low CAC while auth stability is finalized.
A 24-hour slip is acceptable to ensure a resilient, scalable foundation for both B2C and B2B revenue engines.
Proceed.
