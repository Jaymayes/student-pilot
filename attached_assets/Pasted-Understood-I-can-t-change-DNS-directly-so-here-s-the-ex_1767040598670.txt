Understood. I can’t change DNS directly, so here’s the exact, low‑risk runbook to fix www and the follow‑up email pack you requested.

A. DNS fix: make www resolve and 301 to apex
Goal: www.scholaraiadvisor.com must resolve and 301 to https://scholaraiadvisor.com to avoid traffic loss and indexing splits.

Add/verify DNS
Record: www CNAME → scholaraiadvisor.com
TTL: 300s (or provider default)
If your DNS supports “ALIAS/ANAME on apex,” keep apex pointing to your Replit target; do NOT CNAME the apex.
2. Configure redirect (choose one)

Preferred (edge): Add a 301 redirect rule www → apex at your DNS/CDN or hosting edge (single rule; preserve path/query).
App-level fallback: If edge redirect isn’t available, add a server rule to 301 any Host=www.scholaraiadvisor.com to the apex.
3. Verify propagation

dig +short www.scholaraiadvisor.com
curl -I https://www.scholaraiadvisor.com Expect: HTTP/2 301 and Location: https://scholaraiadvisor.com/…
curl -I https://scholaraiadvisor.com Expect: 200 and canonical host
4. GSC alignment

Domain property covers both apex + www.
If you verified only the apex, add www property or keep a Domain property as the single source.
Re‑submit sitemap (done) and Inspect a few www URLs to confirm the 301 is recognized.
Tip: If you need header/redirect control in deployment config, Replit supports custom response headers and rewrites/redirects in deployment settings; use it if your DNS lacks edge rules. Keep logs and resource panels open during changes to confirm live behavior and MTTR if rollback is needed  .

B. T+24h follow-up concierge emails (ready to send)
Send these individually. Keep subject line short; include the personalized Stripe setup link. If your ESP supports variables, replace [First name] dynamically.

C. What to watch in A8 (next 24–48h)

A1 discovery/JWKS p95 ≤150ms for 3 consecutive windows (cache warming).
A5 /api/login p95 ≤200ms sustained 24h (first green window captured).
A3 provider CTA clicks ≥25; utm_source=scholarship_agent (confirm in telemetry).
A6 provider_connected events ≥2; then first listing created within 72h. Use A8 alerts/dashboards to confirm improvements and spot regressions; Replit’s deployment logs/resources aid rapid validation and rollback if needed .
D. Risk and rollback

DNS propagation can take minutes to hours. If unexpected 404/loop, remove the redirect rule and revert the www CNAME, then re‑apply with corrected target.
Keep a single canonical host (apex) via 301 and consistent <link rel="canonical"> to avoid split indexing.
If you’d like, I can draft a third message for Jamarr’s Organization and a T+48h “last reminder” variant now.
