Executive sign-off: Approved. Proceed to execution per your Day 1–30 backlog. The plan aligns with our playbook’s low-CAC, SEO-first acquisition strategy, predictive concierge experience, and B2B-led revenue mix toward $10M ARR with B2B as the dominant share by Year 5   .

Conditions and checkpoints for the 90-day window

Programmatic SEO Engine (B2C-owned)
Go/no-go: adopt SSR/SSG/prerender with caching; avoid full rewrite unless required.
Day-60/90 targets: 1,000+ scholarship/entity pages live and indexable with ≥85% indexed; ≥10% of new signups from organic programmatic pages. This supports our low-CAC growth thesis .
B2B Marketplace integration points (read-only interfaces in B2C)
Day-21: freeze Partner Listings, Recruitment Attribution contracts (acknowledged via API-CONTRACTS-SCHEMA.json).
Day-45: alpha integration with entitlement-gated promotions and attribution events.
Day-90: ≥5 live partner promotions flowing through B2C, aligned to the Year‑2 pilot motion (10–15 partners) and the end-state >80% B2B revenue mix by Year 5 .
Advanced data pipeline consumption (read side)
Enforce schemas for eligibility, materials, deadlines, essay themes; display freshness/quality signals in UI.
Day-90: median freshness ≤72 hours; ≥70% of target sources reflected, per the playbook’s ingestion/normalization mandate .
Predictive matching UX and experimentation
Treat scoring as an external service; in B2C, deliver explanations and A/B tests.
Day-90: measurable lift in apply/click-through vs. baseline with explanations covering explicit eligibility, implicit fit, and competition level per blueprint .
Policy confirmations to preserve

Credit-based pricing and transparency: maintain 4x markup, visible per-model pricing, and receipts for per-use AI services .
Ethical AI: keep “assistant, not writer” positioning and log interventions/acknowledgements for the essay coach .
Security, privacy, resilience: uphold WAF/input validation/allow-lists, least privilege, encryption in transit and at rest, and multi-AZ architecture; schedule pen-test cadence as features scale .
KPI dashboard for weekly review

SEO: indexed pages, impressions, CTR, organic signup share by page cluster (target ≥10% by Day 90) .
Marketplace (B2C side): number of live promoted listings (≥5), valid attribution events, partner click-through to deep links.
Data quality: freshness SLA, field completeness, user-visible freshness indicators tied to ingestion standards .
Matching impact: apply CTR and profile→application conversion lift vs. baseline from predictive ranking .
AI economics: per-use margin ≥4x markup, model mix, latency/timeout adherence by tier .
Week-1 approvals and gates

Finalize SEO architecture decision (SSR/SSG/prerender), URL templates, and editorial/quality guardrails to protect brand while scaling programmatically .
Lock v1 API contracts already drafted for Partner Listings, Recruitment Attribution, Data Freshness/Validation, and ML Scoring; circulate to B2B/Data/ML teams for sign-off by Day 7 (supports Year‑2 pilot path) .
Legal/compliance check of data sourcing display, consent language, and PII masking in logs per FERPA/CCPA posture .
Risk watchlist and mitigations

SEO migration risk: stage rollout with prerender fallbacks; maintain canonicalization and sitemaps to preserve equity.
External service dependency: define circuit breakers and graceful degradation for partner listings and scoring; show stale/fallback states with clear UX.
Experiment power: predefine sample size and MDE to ensure statistically valid readouts by Day 90.
Authority to proceed

You are authorized to begin execution in development branches immediately, following the Day 7/14/21/30 go/no-go checkpoints defined in DAY-1-30-IMPLEMENTATION-BACKLOG.md. Any scope, budget, or timeline variance >10% requires escalation in the weekly exec review.
Thank you. This positions the B2C app as the acquisition and activation engine feeding the B2B marketplace scale we need for the five-year outcome, with clear interfaces and measurement aligned to the playbook’s strategy  .
