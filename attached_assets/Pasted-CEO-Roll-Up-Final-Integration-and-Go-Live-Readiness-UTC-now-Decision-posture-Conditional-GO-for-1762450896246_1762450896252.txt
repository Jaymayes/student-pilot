CEO Roll‑Up: Final Integration and Go‑Live Readiness (UTC now)
Decision posture: Conditional GO for full staging validation today; preliminary GO for Nov 9 (1% production ramp) if gates pass; ARR ignition remains Nov 12.

Cross‑App Critical Path and Gates

16:00 UTC: Secrets/DSNs delivery — reported met by Auth; each DRI to confirm receipt in evidence packs.
17:00 UTC: DNS deliverability gate (SPF/DKIM/DMARC). If not GREEN by 17:01 UTC: NO‑GO for external email; continue internal testing only.
17:05 UTC: scholarship_api ORDER_4 trigger — must produce events with request_id propagation to auto_page_maker and auto_com_center.
21:00 UTC: Staging evidence due from each app (as assigned).
21:15 UTC: CEO chain roll‑up GO/NO‑GO for Nov 9 ramp.
Stop/Escalate Conditions (armed)

Secrets missing per app by T+5 from scheduled delivery.
DNS not GREEN at 17:01 UTC (block outbound email).
P95 drift >120ms in any app during validation.
Any DLQ growth >0 for comms pipeline.
Miss on 21:00/21:15 deliverables.

8. Application: Auto Command Center (auto_com_center)
APP_BASE_URL (Staging): https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
APP_BASE_URL (Prod): https://auto-com-center.scholaraiadvisor.com

Status: Ready; email‑only validation today. SMS deferred to Nov 11 EOD.
Third‑party systems and status:
Email (e.g., Postmark/SMTP): Production config tied to DNS GREEN; staging OK. Integration: Complete; Blocker: DNS must be GREEN.
Sentry DSNs: Delivered; cross‑app request_id correlation armed. Integration: Complete.
AWS SQS/DLQ: Provisioned; DLQ alarm active. Integration: Complete.
SMS (e.g., Twilio): Deferred; Integration: Not Started for production; plan for Nov 11 EOD.
Triggers: Must deliver Email and in‑app notifications on scholarship_agent events when DNS GREEN.
Compliance: CAN‑SPAM/TCPA artifacts ready; Unsubscribe under 5s at 100 concurrent.

CEO directive: If DNS not GREEN at 17:01, block external sends and continue internal end‑to‑end testing; page per protocol on any breach.
KPI Targets and Post‑Ramp Guardrails (Week 1)

Platform SLOs: P95 ≤120ms, error <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9%, unsubscribe <5s @ 100 concurrent.
B2C: First Document Upload activation ≥35%; match‑to‑open ≥55%; time‑to‑first‑value ≤10 min median.
B2B: Provider→first applicant path verified; target 10 net‑new verified providers by Nov 12.
CAC discipline: No paid spend. Prioritize organic SEO via auto_page_maker. Email/in‑app only until SEO lift verified.
Risk Register and Mitigations

DNS deliverability not GREEN by 17:01 UTC: Mitigation = block external email; continue internal testing; run seed‑list preflight the moment DNS flips.
scholar_auth cosmetic error pages: Non‑critical for staging; production unlock requires fix/override by Nov 7, 18:00 UTC.
SMS channel: Deferred to Nov 11 EOD; not required for Nov 9 ramp.
scholarship_sage baseline window: In progress post‑secret; not on critical path; deliver +48h evidence.
Comms pipeline reliability: DLQ must remain 0; alarms active; page on first increment.
ARR Timeline (unchanged)

Nov 9: 1% production ramp (conditional GO at 21:15 UTC today if gates pass).
Nov 11 (EOD): SMS activation.
Nov 12: ARR ignition (B2C + B2B engines).
