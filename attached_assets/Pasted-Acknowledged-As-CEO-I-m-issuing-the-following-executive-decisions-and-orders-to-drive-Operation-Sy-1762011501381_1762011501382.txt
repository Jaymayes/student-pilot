Acknowledged. As CEO, I’m issuing the following executive decisions and orders to drive Operation Synergy to Full Operational Capability while protecting SLOs and revenue timelines.

Decisions and Orders (effective immediately)

Gate 1 — scholar_auth (P0 incident: Replit production cache)
Decision: Escalate now. Auth DRI is Incident Commander; open a P0 with Replit platform support for production cache invalidation/unblock.
SLA: Hard deadline T+60 minutes to restore JWKS and /canary v2.7 at production URL.
Contingency (activate at T+45 if no green light): Prepare Emergency Parallel Deploy (EPD-Auth-01) on alternate hosting using the same code branch (v2.7.1 label). Requirements:
Same OIDC/JWKS surface (RS256), new APP_BASE_URL and JWKS URL via config.
Downstream services must accept the new JWKS URL via env config toggle. No hard-coded origins.
Run the 6 acceptance checks (canary 8/8, 6/6 headers, P95 ≤120ms, 401/403 RBAC, JWKS validation, dependencies_ok=true) before traffic cutover.
Risk guardrails: If EPD is used, rotate signing keys with overlap window and publish both KIDs for 24h.
2. Gate sequencing and authority

Gate 1 (Auth) GO is authorized upon either: a) Replit cache cleared and endpoints verified; or b) EPD-Auth-01 is live and verified.
Gate 2 (scholarship_api) GO authorized within 30 minutes of Gate 1 GREEN. API DRI to publish, verify, and post evidence bundle.
Gate 3 (student_pilot) GO authorized within 15 minutes of Gate 2 GREEN. Frontend DRI to run E2E smoke and post evidence.
3. auto_com_center

Remain in dry-run + manual fallback until Gates 1 and 2 are GREEN. No external sends yet.
Postmark integration may be configured but not activated for live sends until after Gate 3 smoke passes and CEO confirms Day-1 ramp.
Evidence bundle for v2.7 dry-run is accepted. Keep kill switch enabled.
4. scholarship_api

Standby is affirmed. On Gate 1 GREEN, publish within 30 minutes and verify:
/canary v2.7 with 8 fields, 6/6 security headers, RBAC 401/403, JWKS validation to the active Auth JWKS, P95 ≤120ms (≤250ms acceptable for initial 10 minutes while warm-up).
Post evidence within 15 minutes of deploy. Declare GREEN when all checks pass.
5. scholarship_sage

Status GREEN accepted. Maintain A/B testing OFF for first 48 hours post platform-wide GREEN.
Participate in Gate 3 smoke; record recommendation latency and accuracy metrics.
6. provider_register

Status GREEN (conditional) accepted. Do not onboard new providers until Gate 2 is GREEN.
Ensure 3% fee disclosure and role isolation are verified again post Gate 2 deploy.
7. student_pilot

Status STANDBY accepted. Execute Gate 3 E2E smoke within 15 minutes of Gate 2 GREEN:
Full auth journey, profile save, search via API, receive Sage recommendations, submit test application, see status, and receive dry-run comms event.
Capture HAR, screenshots, and P95 metrics; post evidence.
8. Capital allocation and contingency runway

Approved: up to $1,500 for emergency platform/hosting to execute EPD-Auth-01 if needed.
If Replit remains blocked beyond T+60, proceed with EPD-Auth-01 and cutover configurations for dependent services.
9. Risk, compliance, and change control

Code Freeze: Lock app version at v2.7 across all services for 24 hours post GREEN, hotfixes only.
Compliance: Continue enforcement of RBAC, FERPA/COPPA, CAN-SPAM/GDPR opt-outs, standardized error formats, HTTPS-only.
Observability: All DRIs must capture 30-sample P95 from production canary endpoints as part of evidence bundles.
10. War-room cadence and reporting

Cadence: Every 15 minutes or on gate transitions. Use exact format: app | gate | status | canary | p95 | blocker | next action | ETA.
Section 7 reports: Acknowledge receipt for services that submitted. Append production evidence once GREEN. If any report is missing, submit within T+60.
Final GO/NO-GO Summary

scholar_auth: GO for escalation now; GO for EPD at T+45 if needed; GREEN required to unlock Gates 2 and 3.
scholarship_api: Conditional GO upon Gate 1 GREEN; 30-minute SLA to GREEN.
student_pilot: Conditional GO upon Gate 2 GREEN; 15-minute SLA to smoke completion.
scholarship_sage: GREEN; standby for Gate 3.
provider_register: GREEN (conditional); onboarding begins immediately after Gate 2 GREEN.
auto_com_center: GREEN in dry-run; no live sends until Gate 3 passes and CEO confirms ramp.
CEO notes

Student value drives revenue: prioritize stability in Auth and API over speed. Do not ship partial workarounds that weaken security posture.
Keep CAC low: Do not activate SEO landing pages to index until Gate 2 is GREEN and data accuracy is confirmed.
Proceed. DRIs: execute per above, post next war-room update in 15 minutes or upon Gate 1 transition.
