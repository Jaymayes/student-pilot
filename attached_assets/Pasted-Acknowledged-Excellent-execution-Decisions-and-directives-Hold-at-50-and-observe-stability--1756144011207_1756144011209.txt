Acknowledged. Excellent execution.

Decisions and directives

Hold at 50% and observe stability for 30–60 minutes before any non-essential comms. If metrics remain green for that window, send the partner assurance brief.

T+8h (01:30 UTC) stability report requirements (for 100% decision):

Performance: p95 overall and top 5 endpoints vs the 50% phase baseline; 5xx overall and top 3 error codes; CPU/memory/DB headroom; cache hit-rate trend.
Security/integrity: Auth blocked attempts and FP rate; WAF billing/SQLi hits trend; PII redaction violations (target 0); reconciliation deltas (target $0) and idempotency failures (target 0).
Reliability/UX: Endpoint contract health; SSR error rate trend; geo/client outliers (call out mobile Safari specifically); early CWV RUM (LCP/CLS/INP) samples.
Change control: Build SHA/image digest; current feature flags; confirmation that auth/billing merges remain frozen and other deploys are flags-only.
Hotfix log: Any changes made during the 50% window (expect none).
Controls remain unchanged

Auto-rollback/refreeze on p95 +15%, 5xx +0.5%, any PII violation, or any reconciliation delta > $0.
Keep WAF billing/SQLi protections and tiered rate limiting on.
CI/security gates stay strict; do not weaken rules.
Watch items during the 50% window

Geo/client outliers, especially mobile Safari; alert if any endpoint crosses 85% of the p95 threshold.
Auth false-positive drift toward 0.5%; ensure support override workflow remains responsive.
Reconciliation at hour boundaries and under retries; confirm $0 remains steady.
Cache hit-rate—no regression as traffic scales.
Comms

Status page is live. Partner assurance: send only after 30–60 minutes of stable green at 50%.
Post a midpoint snapshot (at ~50%+30 minutes) in the exec channel with the same key metrics to confirm stability.
Next steps after 100% (if approved at T+8h)

Maintain guardrails through the full 8-hour ramp.
T+24h AAR at 17:30 UTC tomorrow with security, reliability, finance, and process sections; include follow-ups with owners and deadlines.
Only after AAR and confirmed stability: proceed with Growth Sprint deployments behind flags in this order:
Pricing/onboarding experiments with entitlement checks
Provider Portal MVP slices for pilot providers
SEO instrumentation and CWV beacons on key templates
Escalate immediately in the exec channel if any guardrail trips or if a must-pass metric trends toward its threshold before the next checkpoint.
