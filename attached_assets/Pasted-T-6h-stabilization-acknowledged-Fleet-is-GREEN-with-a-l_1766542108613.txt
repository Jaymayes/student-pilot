T+6h stabilization acknowledged. Fleet is GREEN with a latency watch.

Snapshot (T+6h)

Organic: GO (live)
Paid: HOLD (until T+24h)
iOS Gate: CLOSED (PASS)
Callback errors: 0.18% (improving; under 0.5% threshold)
A1 p95: 258ms (improving from 274ms; target ≤ 250ms by T+24h)
Uptime: 100%
Guardrails: Passing
T+6h Slack line (paste as-is)
Hour: 02:35 UTC (T+6h)
Logins: Guardrails Passing (Success Rate > 99.5%)
Callback errors: 0.18% (Target ≤ 0.5%)
A1 p95: 258ms (Watch: >250ms target) | Uptime: 100%
A5 checkout starts: Monitoring (Organic Baseline)
Status: GREEN (Latency Watch)
Notes: System stable. A1 latency improving (258ms). Paid traffic HOLD continues.

Low-risk latency quick wins to hit ≤ 250 ms by T+24h (A1 only)

Keep‑alive on Node/Express
Use an HTTP keep‑alive agent (e.g., agentkeepalive) for outbound calls.
server.keepAliveTimeout ≥ 75,000 ms; headersTimeout > keepAliveTimeout.
OIDC/JWKS caching (server-side)
Cache discovery and JWKS for 5–10 minutes in memory with background refresh to avoid cold fetches.
Compression and static tuning
Enable gzip/br on text assets; set Cache-Control on static/HTML appropriately (no-cache for HTML; far-future for hashed assets).
DB connection pool hygiene
pg: min=2–4, max tuned to footprint; statement_timeout sane (e.g., 4–8s); avoid connection churn.
TLS session reuse
Ensure TLS session tickets/resumption aren’t disabled by proxy; reuse across calls to reduce handshake overhead.
Avoid redundant remote calls on the hot path
Confirm no discovery/remote metadata is fetched per request; ensure it’s resolved once and reused.
Alert thresholds until T+24h

YELLOW if:
Callback errors > 0.5% (rolling hour), or
A1 p95 > 300 ms for 2 consecutive hourly checkpoints
RED if:
Callback errors > 1.0% (any 15‑min window), or
A1 p95 > 400 ms (sustained 30 min), or
Any auth degradation/5xx spike on A1/A5, or A6 /healthz ≠ 200
Next checkpoint

T+7h (03:35 UTC) or any gate change. I’ll continue hourly monitoring and post GREEN/YELLOW/RED accordingly.
Optional

I can prep a tiny A1 patch (diff) that safely adds:
Node keep‑alive agent
In‑memory OIDC/JWKS cache with background refresh
Helmet/compression settings alignment
Minimal pool tune for pg Say “Draft A1 latency patch” and I’ll generate a ready-to-apply snippet and rollback note.
