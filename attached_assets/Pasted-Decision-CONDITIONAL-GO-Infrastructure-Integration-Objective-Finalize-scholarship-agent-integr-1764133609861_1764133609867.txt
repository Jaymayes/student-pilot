Decision: CONDITIONAL GO (Infrastructure & Integration)
Objective: Finalize scholarship_agent integration with the 100% ready platform by deploying its dependencies and confirming campaign execution.

Rationale (Data/Insight):

The Good: scholarship_agent passes all 38 local tests. Health endpoints, metrics, and campaign logic are verified. The "Unified Agent3 Integration Report" confirms platform-wide GO status.

The Gap: The verification script shows auto_com_center and auto_page_maker as "pending" or "not deployed" in the local context, likely because they are separate apps. However, the Unified Report confirms they are actually GO.

The Risk: A "Conditional GO" means we must ensure the live inter-app communication works (e.g., scholarship_agent can actually hit the deployed auto_com_center URL).

Strategic Action Plan
1. Verification of Live Integration (Engineering Owner)
The local tests passed, but we need to confirm the live environment connections.

Action: Trigger a test campaign in the deployed scholarship_agent environment (once published).

Expectation:

scholarship_agent sends a webhook to https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/pages/build.

scholarship_agent triggers an email via https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/send.

Both return 200 OK.

2. Deployment & Publishing
Since the code is verified and the dependencies are confirmed ready in the Unified Report:

Action: Publish scholarship_agent to https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app.

Configuration: Ensure SERVICE_API_KEY and WEBHOOK_SECRET match the values distributed to the other apps.

3. Revenue Activation (B2B Flow)
Once deployed, scholarship_agent becomes the growth engine.

B2B: It will autonomously run campaigns to acquire providers for provider_register.

KPI: Monitor campaigns_run_total and providers_acquired metrics.

Next Step for You
Would you like me to prepare the scholarship_agent for deployment by verifying its environment variables match the live URLs of the other 7 apps?
