CEO Executive Decision Memo — Agent3 Go-Live Authorization

Prime directive restated: Protect brand trust and the SEO flywheel while executing the go-live plan that ignites ARR and keeps us on track toward $10M profitable ARR. Evidence-first posture. No comms or charging without GREEN gates and posted evidence.

Scope for Agent3

You are DRI for: student_pilot
You are deliverability executor for: auto_com_center
All other apps remain under their DRIs. Observe-only unless escalated.
Section V–compliant status reports

APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

Blockers (gates):
Deliverability GREEN (depends on DNS_READY → auto_com_center T+90 certification)
Stripe PASS (COO/Finance)
Pre-soak PASS (scheduled 20:00–21:00 UTC today)
Estimated Go-Live:
Primary: Nov 11, 16:00 UTC (all gates GREEN + evidence)
Conditional: Nov 12, 16:00 UTC (exactly one gate slips ≤24h with mitigation + CEO approval)
ARR Ignition: B2C credit sales (4x markup) upon go-live. No charging until Deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS + CEO GREEN.
Third-Party Dependencies:
scholar_auth (OIDC/PKCE/SSO; token revocation; watch: background token cleanup DB issue—non-blocking for pre-soak; remediation + RCA due Nov 12 EOD)
scholarship_api (student data/search/match; must meet P95 ≤120ms; no-PII logs)
auto_com_center (transactional comms; deliverability gate)
Stripe (payments; auth ≥95%, refunds 100% in test)
Monitoring/alerting stack (uptime, latency, error budget)
Section IV readiness (CEO confirmation subject to evidence tonight):
Security & Compliance: MFA/SSO, RBAC, TLS, PKCE, immediate token revocation; no-PII logging; FERPA/COPPA posture checked
Scalability & Performance: SLO targets set; synthetic checks in place
Integration: request_id lineage auth → API → app
Reliability & Maintainability: 99.9% uptime target; rollback plan documented
Data Management & Analytics: activation funnel telemetry; data integrity checks
Testing & Deployment: Pre-soak + T+30 evidence; rollback procedures validated
Required evidence (21:30–22:00 UTC):
P50/P95 latency histograms; uptime; error tallies
PKCE flow proof + immediate token revocation proof
request_id lineage examples (auth → API → app)
No-PII logging validation
Executive summary with clear PASS/FAIL
Go/No-Go rules:
GO Nov 11 if: Pre-soak PASS + Deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS + evidence posted
Conditional GO Nov 12 if: one gate slips ≤24h with mitigation + CEO approval
NO-GO: any unresolved gate or missing/late evidence
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (awaiting DNS_READY)

Blocker: DNS_READY signal (Deputy Ops). If missed at deadline, execute fallback subdomain per pre-approved plan and escalate to CTO immediately.
Estimated Go-Live:
GREEN at T+90 from T0 (DNS_READY)
Contingency: Nov 10, 14:00 UTC latest
ARR Impact: Enables transactional/activation comms for B2C/B2B funnels immediately upon GREEN.
Section IV readiness (CEO confirmation subject to evidence):
Security & Compliance: SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment; DMARC p=quarantine; audit logs
Scalability: Postmark shared pool; no dedicated IP until data supports
Integration: Templates/webhooks wired; monitoring/alerts on
Reliability: Bounce/blocklist monitoring; rollback SOP
Testing & Deployment: Seed plan and T+90 certification SOP locked
Deliverability GREEN success criteria:
SPF/DKIM/DMARC PASS with alignment
≥90% inbox placement; ≤10% Gmail Promotions (transactional)
≤0.3% bounce; zero blocklists; DMARC p=quarantine confirmed
Required evidence (T+90 + 15 min posting window):
DNS record proofs + ESP verification
7 seed inbox headers + placement stats
Bounce and blocklist screenshots
Executive summary with CLEAR GREEN/RED call
Executive decisions and orders

Proceed tonight with pre-soak and evidence bundles
Pre-soak window: 20:00–21:00 UTC
T+30 evidence posting: 21:30–22:00 UTC
Guardrails (all must PASS or trigger immediate rollback + 60‑minute RCA):
Uptime ≥99.9%
P95 ≤120ms service-side (≤200ms E2E)
Error rate ≤0.1%
request_id lineage across auth → API → app
PKCE correctness; immediate token revocation proof
No PII in logs; Responsible AI controls active
2. Deliverability T+90 certification

T0 = DNS_READY signal. If DNS_READY is missed, escalate to CTO and execute fallback subdomain immediately. Maintain 15‑minute evidence posting window after T+90 completes.
3. Payments gate

Stripe PASS due by the agreed deadline. If missed, obtain ETA + mitigation. Comms/charging freeze remains in effect until Deliverability GREEN and Stripe PASS are both GREEN with posted evidence.
4. scholar_auth watch item

Background token cleanup DB connection issue remains non-blocking for pre-soak; remediation + RCA due Nov 12 EOD. Track and include any recurrence in tonight’s evidence. This must be fully resolved before GA.
5. Change control and freezes

No vendor switch and no dedicated IP until data justifies (only if seed inbox placement <80% after two remediations).
No external comms or charging until CEO GREEN after evidence review.
Maintain freeze on non-essential changes across the ecosystem through the soft-launch window.
6. KPIs for this phase

Deliverability: ≥90% inbox, ≤10% Promotions, ≥40% open on activation
Activation (student_pilot): ≥35% first-session activation (first document upload)
Payments: ≥95% auth success; 100% test refunds
Platform SLOs: ≥99.9% uptime; P95 ≤120ms; error ≤0.1%
7. Reporting discipline

Master Evidence Index must be updated within 15 minutes of each milestone with links to logs, screenshots, and metrics.
If any deadline risks slipping, execute the immediate escalation protocol: current status, blocker, request_id references, mitigation, revised ETA.
Strategic rationale

ARR ignition depends on a clean, low-CAC activation funnel. Deliverability and payments gates are binary for brand trust and monetization. We will not trade short-term speed for long-term SEO and reputation risk. Evidence-first execution keeps us aligned with the $10M profitable ARR plan.
Your next actions (Agent3)

Confirm DNS_READY receipt or execute CTO escalation + fallback subdomain; start T+90 immediately upon T0.
Execute pre-soak at 20:00 UTC; post T+30 bundles 21:30–22:00 UTC for student_pilot and for the systems under your evidencing scope.
Hold freeze on comms/charging until CEO GREEN after evidence review.
If any guardrail breaches, roll back immediately and deliver the 60‑minute RCA.
I will issue GO/NO‑GO for Nov 11, 16:00 UTC based on your posted evidence.
