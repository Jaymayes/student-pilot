Acknowledged. Your assessment is correct: we cannot restore traffic with a broken wallet. Execute the direct schema realignment now and treat this as T+0.

Immediate order (execute now, Postgres-safe)

Goal: Make the running code’s target table name “overnight_protocols_ledger” resolve to the actual ledger table.
Preconditions:
Confirm overnight_protocols_ledger does NOT exist.
Confirm financial_ledger DOES exist.
SQL (single transactional patch)
BEGIN;
LOCK TABLE financial_ledger IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE;

-- Rename table to match application expectation
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS financial_ledger RENAME TO overnight_protocols_ledger;

-- Keep index names consistent (harmless if they don’t exist)
ALTER INDEX IF EXISTS financial_ledger_pkey RENAME TO overnight_protocols_ledger_pkey;
ALTER INDEX IF EXISTS financial_ledger_event_id_key RENAME TO overnight_protocols_ledger_event_id_key;
ALTER INDEX IF EXISTS idx_ledger_provider_id RENAME TO idx_opl_provider_id;
ALTER INDEX IF EXISTS idx_ledger_event_type RENAME TO idx_opl_event_type;
ALTER INDEX IF EXISTS idx_ledger_status RENAME TO idx_opl_status;
ALTER INDEX IF EXISTS idx_ledger_created_at RENAME TO idx_opl_created_at;
ALTER INDEX IF EXISTS idx_ledger_scholarship_id RENAME TO idx_opl_scholarship_id;

-- If a serial/identity sequence exists, rename for consistency (dependency will update automatically)
ALTER SEQUENCE IF EXISTS financial_ledger_id_seq RENAME TO overnight_protocols_ledger_id_seq;

COMMIT;

Verification (log-level, not dashboards)

App write test: Trigger one real ledger write (or the heartbeat path).
Required evidence back to me:
A8 log snippet: LEDGER_PERSIST_SUCCESS with table=overnight_protocols_ledger and the new row’s id/event_id.
Database proof: SELECT COUNT(*) and a SELECT … ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1 from overnight_protocols_ledger showing the new record.
Absence of error lines: relation "overnight_protocols_ledger" does not exist.
Controls and gates (unchanged)

Traffic cap stays 0%.
Safety Lock and refunds remain ON.
Telemetry accept-and-spool and probe suppression stay active.
Finance freeze remains ON (no invoicing/fee postings) until:
60-minute clean run starts AFTER the first LEDGER_PERSIST_SUCCESS, and completes with:
Telemetry Acceptance ≥99%, queue <100, 0×428
Provider P95 ≤500ms; /api/login P95 ≤200ms; auth 5xx=0
DB P95 ≤100ms; 0 statement timeouts
0 sitemap 429; 0 /metrics/p95 404; 0 localhost probes
Reconciliation packet is produced for any missed ledger events
CFO sign-off received
Noise handling

Ignore [SECURITY] Blocked underscore property: _meta for now. Do not spend cycles on it until wallet is green.
Timer reset

The prior “green” window is void. The 60-minute stability timer will start only after you post the first LEDGER_PERSIST_SUCCESS with the proof above.
Proceed and report back with the two log artifacts (success write + DB select) immediately after the rename completes.
