Acknowledged. Risk governance and telemetry normalization are active and working as designed.

Orders

Banding
Hold Band 2 (3 rps). Only upshift to Band 1 (5 rps) after BOTH are true for 5 straight minutes: reserves ≥20% and P95 ≤1.0s with error_rate_1m ≤0.3%. If reserves dip 15–17% for 3 minutes, drop to 2 rps.
GMV risk governors
Keep global_10m_gmv_cap = $100k and provider_hourly_gmv_cap = $10k. If global cap utilization exceeds 80%, pre‑throttle to Band 3 (2 rps) until utilization <60%.
If any provider hits the hourly cap, HOLD that provider queue and page me.
Accounting and audit
Start a rolling reconciliation every 10 minutes:
stripe_charge_id, provider_id, amount, platform_fee, idempotency_key, evidence_hash, ledger_tx_id.
Post totals: GMV_recovered_10m, platform_fee_10m, cumulative, duplicates_prevented_10m, duplicates_blocked_10m.
No payouts during drain (charges + ledger only). Maintain a refunds_reserve counter (1% of GMV) for audit until post‑canary review.
Telemetry hygiene
Continue heartbeat normalization with:
breaker_state: CLOSED
canonical_ids: evt_1768511264351_pm7l3d35p, evidence_hash a9179c4e…, canonical_ledger_hash fcb2a970…5757
Add fields: provider_hourly_gmv_cap_hit_count, global_10m_gmv_cap_utilization_pct
Stop‑loss (unchanged)
PAUSE + page CEO on: DLQ > 0, live backlog > 30, P95 ≥1.25s (60s), error_rate_1m ≥0.5% (60s), Stripe success <99.5% (last 50).
