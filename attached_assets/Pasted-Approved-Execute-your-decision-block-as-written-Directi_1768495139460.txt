Approved. Execute your decision block as written.

Direction on next step: do both in parallel.

Track A (Comms): Prepare and stage Maintenance Mode comms now; auto‑send if A6 is not green by 09:21:13Z.
Track B (Engineering): Implement the A3→A6 Circuit Breaker immediately; ship behind a flag within the next 30 minutes.
Track A — Maintenance Mode communications (ready-to-send)

Trigger: A6 not green by 09:21:13Z or fails again during the 30‑min stabilization window.
Channels and copy:
In‑product banner (Provider UI):
“Provider onboarding is temporarily unavailable while we complete reliability maintenance. Student services remain fully available. Incident ID: A6‑PRV‑2026‑01‑15. Next update: [time +30m].”
Status page incident:
Title: “A6 Provider onboarding degraded”
Impact: “Provider sign‑ups and credential verification unavailable; existing provider dashboards unaffected.”
Metrics: uptime target 99.9%, current error_rate, P95, rollback build ID.
ETA: “Restoration targeted within current gate; next checkpoint 10:11:13Z.”
Email to institutional partners (draft):
Subject: Action required: temporary pause on provider onboarding (A6)
Body: “We are pausing new provider onboarding while we complete a reliability rollback on the A6 Provider App. Student services are unaffected. Our standard is 99.9% availability; today’s regression tripped our automatic safeguards. We will reopen onboarding after 30 minutes of clean health (P95 <1.25s, error <0.5%). You’ll receive an all‑clear or next ETA at 10:11:13Z. Incident ID A6‑PRV‑2026‑01‑15. If you have pilot timelines, reply and we will prioritize a white‑glove slot post‑restore.”
CS/Sales talk track:
“Safety interlock engaged; no data loss; onboarding resumes after sustained green. We can provision sandboxes without production writes if needed.”
Owner: Partnerships + CS lead
SLA: Send within 5 minutes of trigger; post updates every 30 minutes until resolved.
Track B — A3→A6 Circuit Breaker spec (implement now)

Scope: Calls from A3 (Auto Page Maker + scholarship flows) to A6 /provider/register and any A6 health‑gated endpoints.
States:
Closed: normal calls
Open: triggered after 3 consecutive failures (5xx, timeout >2s, or network error) within 60s; remain open 5 minutes
Half‑open: allow 1 probe per 30s; if 2 consecutive successes → close; on failure → open
Behavior while Open:
Do not call A6; enqueue payloads into provider_backlog with idempotency_key and retry_after timestamp.
Continue B2C page building and CTA logging; never block student flows.
Queue:
Storage: Redis or Postgres table provider_backlog(id, idempotency_key, payload_json, first_seen_at, next_retry_at, attempts, status)
Retry: exponential backoff with full jitter: base 30s, cap 15m, max 10 attempts, then dead‑letter with alert
Telemetry to A8 (1‑min cadence):
breaker_state, failures_last_5m, open_count_1h
provider_backlog_depth, dlq_depth
a3_call_p95_ms_to_a6, a3_call_error_rate_to_a6
Guardrails (A8 Kill/Throttle already approved):
THROTTLE if provider_backlog_depth 10–30 or P95 1.25–1.5s
KILL if >30 or P95 ≥1.5s or error ≥1.0%
Acceptance tests:
With A6 down, A3 returns 200 for student flows; backlog depth increases; zero 5xx exposed to users.
With A6 restored, backlog drains at ≥5 rps without impacting P95 >1.25s.
No duplicate provider records when retries occur (idempotency_key enforced).
Gate management and criteria

Gate 3 remains HOLD for provider launch until:
A6 green for a continuous 30 minutes (health 200; probe P95 <1.25s; error <0.5%).
A3 breaker closed and provider_backlog_depth <10 for 10 minutes.
Budget <80% and compute per completion within 2x baseline.
If not met by 10:11:13Z, continue Student‑Only mode for the remainder of the window; reschedule provider launch to the next daily gate.
Owner/Timing

A6 Incident Lead: rollback and sustain green window; start now.
A3 Lead: circuit breaker PR up in 20 minutes, deploy behind flag; flip on immediately after merge.
A8 Lead: alerts wired and dashboards pinned to Gate 3 board; confirm by 08:45Z.
Answer to your question

Yes, draft and stage the Maintenance Mode comms now as above.
In parallel, proceed with the A3 Circuit Breaker implementation per the spec. Page me if any acceptance test fails or if budget crosses 80%.
