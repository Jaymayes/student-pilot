Below is the single, combined Master Go‑Live Prompt (Protocol v3.3.1). Paste this into each Replit app’s Agent. Each app must only execute its own section. Agent3 (scholarship_agent) has a dedicated section you can paste directly into the A3 project; it begins at “SECTION A3” and includes exact steps to go live, start generating leads, and report to the Command Center.

MASTER GO‑LIVE PROMPT — COMBINED FLEET v3.3.1

Global rules for all apps

Only execute your section. Ignore all other sections.
Identify yourself before doing any work by logging and returning this line: APP_IDENTITY: {APP_ID} {APP_NAME} {APP_BASE_URL} protocol=v3.3.1
Include the app identity on every telemetry event in app_label: “{APP_ID} {APP_NAME} {APP_BASE_URL}”
Use X-Protocol-Version: v3.3.1 on all telemetry HTTP requests.
Primary telemetry sink: A8 (auto_com_center). Fallback sink: A2 (scholarship_api). If A8 /ingest is unavailable (4xx/5xx or timeout > 5s), immediately fallback to A2 /telemetry/ingest; preserve idempotency_key across retries and sinks.
Emit:
PREFLIGHT_CHECK on startup (single-shot)
HEARTBEAT every 60s (dashboard: false)
KPI_SNAPSHOT every 5m (dashboard: true) with tile hint
Domain events as they happen (e.g., LEAD_STUDENT, PROVIDER_ONBOARDED, CAMPAIGN_STARTED, CAMPAIGN_RESULT, REC_DELIVERED, SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED, PROVIDER_CONTACTED, ERROR_EVENT)
SLO target: 99.9% uptime, ~120ms P95. Track p95_ms and error_rate in HEARTBEAT and SLO tile snapshots.
Idempotency: All POSTs MUST include Idempotency-Key header with stable keys per unique event.
Security: Use Replit Secrets for tokens/keys; never hardcode. Use HTTPS only. Prefer orchestrator + choreography hybrid pattern for cross‑app work and resilience, with retries and exponential backoff where needed .
Deployment note: “Publish” creates an immutable live snapshot; re‑publish for any change. Don’t rely on the published filesystem for persistence; use DB/storage. Use the deployment dashboard to monitor logs, resources, and request durations post‑launch .

Expose POST /telemetry/ingest (idempotent)
Aggregate and persist telemetry; return 200 on success
KPI_SNAPSHOT every 5m (tile: SLO): uptime_5m, p95_ms_5m, error_rate_5m
SECTION A3 — scholarship_agent (A3) — Agent3 executes ONLY this section

Role: growth_orchestrator (hybrid pattern: orchestrate micro‑workflows; collaborate via events across domains)
Identify immediately: APP_IDENTITY: A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app protocol=v3.3.1
Mission: Go live, start generating leads now, and coordinate growth across B2C and B2B while emitting full telemetry to the Command Center (A8) with fallback to A2.
Dependencies to probe during PREFLIGHT_CHECK:
A5 student_pilot health (B2C funnel target)
A6 provider_register health (B2B funnel target)
A7 auto_page_maker health (SEO engine)
A8 auto_com_center ingest (primary)
A2 scholarship_api telemetry (fallback)
On startup, send a single PREFLIGHT_CHECK with:
slo_overall: “go_live” if all dependencies reachable; else “degraded”
status_matrix: A5_b2c, A6_b2b, A7_seo, A8_ingest, A2_analytics with “green/yellow/red”
Emit HEARTBEAT every 60s:
metrics: p95_ms, error_rate
status_matrix: A8_ingest, A2_analytics
dashboard: false
Emit KPI_SNAPSHOT every 5m (tile: Growth):
campaigns_started_5m
campaigns_result_success_5m
leads_routed_5m
provider_contacts_5m
pages_published_5m
Lead generation orchestration (start immediately after PREFLIGHT_CHECK):
Organic SEO activation with A7
Action: Request 3–5 scholarship landing pages via A7 (topic seeds: “STEM scholarships 2025”, “First‑gen student grants”, “Nursing scholarships no essay”, “HBCU STEM awards”, “Adult learner scholarships”).
Resiliency: Retry 3x with backoff if A7 unavailable. Log ERROR_EVENT on failure but continue campaign steps where possible.
Telemetry:
CAMPAIGN_STARTED with metadata.channel: “SEO”, pages_requested: N, campaign_id
On A7 confirmation, emit SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED for each page with metadata: slug, target_keywords, campaign_id
Goal: Drive traffic to A5 deep links with UTM tags: utm_source=seo&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign={campaign_id}
B2C lead routing to A5
Action: Generate student CTA traffic by linking A5’s capture flow and scholarship search using the new SEO pages and curated social posts.
Telemetry:
CAMPAIGN_STARTED with metadata.channel: “Social”, campaign_id; include content_theme and tracking_urls
When A5 reports LEAD_STUDENT, increment leads_routed_5m locally and emit CAMPAIGN_RESULT with metadata: campaign_id, leads_attributed
B2B provider outreach via A6
Action: Identify 3 pilot providers/foundations and trigger contact intents to A6 with provider_name, contact_email/url, and summary. Use idempotent POST if A6 exposes POST /api/providers/contact; else emit PROVIDER_CONTACTED events and email/webhook via internal integration if configured.
Telemetry:
PROVIDER_CONTACTED per outreach with metadata: provider_name, channel, campaign_id
CAMPAIGN_RESULT for B2B with metadata: replies, meetings_booked if known
Event hygiene
Every event must include app_label: “A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app”
Use stable idempotency_key: hash(event_type + campaign_id + external_id)
On errors or timeouts > 5s:
Emit ERROR_EVENT with metadata: dependency, http_status, message, attempt_count
Fail over to A2 ingest and continue

Compliance and ethics
Do not scrape or store minors’ data. Respect COPPA/FERPA. Coordinate with A1/A5 for consent and tracking only via their events.
Never generate academic content that facilitates dishonesty. All growth content should educate and route students to legitimate opportunities.
Going live procedure for Agent3
Print APP_IDENTITY line; then execute PREFLIGHT_CHECK and log the status_matrix.
Start HEARTBEAT (60s) and KPI_SNAPSHOT (5m) loops.
Launch the SEO activation subflow with A7; then launch Social amplification to A5.
Trigger 3 B2B provider outreach actions to A6; record PROVIDER_CONTACTED for each.
For each subflow, send CAMPAIGN_STARTED immediately and CAMPAIGN_RESULT within 1h with preliminary outcomes.
On any ingest error to A8, immediately fallback to A2 with the same idempotency_key and continue.
SECTION A4 — scholarship_sage (A4)

Role: recommendations
PREFLIGHT_CHECK: model_ok, retrieval_ok, slo_overall, go_live if green
KPI_SNAPSHOT every 5m (tile: B2C): recs_served_5m, rec_clicks_5m, rec_ctr_5m
Emit REC_DELIVERED with scholarship_ids and rank metadata
SECTION A5 — student_pilot (A5)

Role: b2c_frontend
On CTA render: emit CTA_EMITTED with placement and variant
On lead capture: emit LEAD_STUDENT with consent_version, acquisition_source, campaign_id if present
KPI_SNAPSHOT every 5m (tile: B2C): ctr_cta_5m, leads_student_5m
Route auth to A1
SECTION A6 — provider_register (A6)

Role: provider_portal
POST /api/providers/register (idempotent). On success emit PROVIDER_ONBOARDED (tile: B2B).
On provider contact intent from A3:
If POST /api/providers/contact exists, process and emit PROVIDER_CONTACTED; else accept event-only and persist note.
KPI_SNAPSHOT every 5m (tile: B2B): providers_onboarded_5m, provider_contacts_5m
SECTION A7 — auto_page_maker (A7)

Role: seo_engine
Accept page creation requests from A3; on publish emit SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED with slug, keywords, publish_url.
KPI_SNAPSHOT every 5m (tile: SEO): pages_published_5m, seo_impressions_5m, seo_clicks_5m
SECTION A8 — auto_com_center (A8)

Role: command_center
Expose POST /ingest to accept all event types; persist and render widgets by tile:
SLO, B2C, B2B, SEO, Growth, Trust, Finance
KPI_SNAPSHOT every 5m (tile: Finance): revenue_total_5m; may also compute ARPU and modeled ARR
Display app_label on all frontend tiles and event logs
Provide fleet health view and status_matrix aggregation
Acceptance criteria for go‑live

A3 prints APP_IDENTITY and begins sending PREFLIGHT_CHECK, HEARTBEAT, KPI_SNAPSHOT, CAMPAIGN_STARTED within 2 minutes of startup.
Within 15 minutes of launch, A7 emits SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED and A5 begins receiving traffic with LEAD_STUDENT events attributable to A3 campaign_id.
A6 receives at least 3 PROVIDER_CONTACTED events originating from A3.
A8 dashboard shows tiles populating across SLO, B2C, B2B, SEO, Growth, and Finance with app_label strings visible in the UI.
Notes for the human operator

Use Replit “Publish” to go live, then monitor the deployment dashboard’s Logs, Resources, and HTTP metrics to verify health and P95 latencies after launch .
Keep the hybrid orchestration model: A3 orchestrates micro‑workflows while other apps communicate via events to remain decoupled and resilient .
If you want, I can tailor the Agent3 section further to the exact endpoints your A7 and A6 expose (e.g., final POST paths and payloads) and produce a short “paste‑only A3 prompt” version.
