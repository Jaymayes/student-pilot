CEO Decisions and Directives — Operation Synergy

FOC posture

Overall FOC: HOLD. We will not declare FOC until auto_com_center completes the 5× DRY-RUN and meets acceptance criteria.
Critical blockers: auto_com_center (canary heap pressure), provider_register (AUTH_ISSUER_URL secret).
Authorizations and immediate actions

Comms DRI (auto_com_center): Proceed now with full DRY-RUN test plan documentation and pre-stage dashboards, fixtures, and evidence templates. On Infra green, you have a GO to execute the 5× DRY-RUN immediately. Acceptance criteria remain:
≥99% delivery success, zero DLQ growth, opt-out verified, bounce/complaint handling confirmed, complete compliant audit trails.
Run in allowlisted mode only until compliance checks pass (no broad user sends).
SLA: Complete execution and evidence within 2 hours of Infra unblock.
Comms Infra: P0, 2-hour SLA to resolve heap pressure and prevent canary auto-rollback. Exit criteria: ≥30% memory headroom sustained and no rollback under synthetic peak for 30 minutes. This is the pacing item for FOC.
Auth DRI (scholar_auth): GO for the E2E testing window. Proceed with student_pilot immediately. provider_register is conditionally GO once the Operator updates AUTH_ISSUER_URL.
Operator (provider_register secret): P0, 15-minute SLA to set AUTH_ISSUER_URL = https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app and restart. If not complete by T+15, escalate to CEO and proceed with student_pilot E2E regardless.
Frontend DRI (student_pilot): On Auth GREEN, execute:
Smoke test (SLA 30 minutes) then 30-sample E2E (SLA 90 minutes).
Acceptance criteria: Auth success ≥98%, P95 latency ≤120 ms on top 5 calls, zero critical 5xx, WCAG Lighthouse ≥90, standardized error with request_id, RBAC 401/403 verified. Package the evidence bundle with SHA256.
Growth DRI (auto_page_maker SEO): GO now. Complete the SEO DRY-RUN in 24 hours. Report indexed pages, impressions/CTR, and funnel conversion to student_pilot activation. Non-blocking for FOC but critical for CAC targets.
Stability and change management

Freeze: scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, and scholarship_agent remain API/schema-frozen during E2E/DRY-RUN windows. No breaking changes.
Outbound comms guardrail: Until auto_com_center passes DRY-RUN and compliance checks, keep outbound comms restricted to allowlisted test recipients.
Evidence and reporting requirements

Evidence bundles (all DRIs): Provide queue depth graphs, success/undelivered counts, DLQ stats, opt-out logs, provider receipts, HAR files, latency P50/P95/P99, standardized error samples with request_id, screenshots of key flows, and SHA256 for each bundle.
Summarize results on a single executive page per DRI with a binary PASS/FAIL against acceptance criteria and a clear Go/No-Go recommendation.
Business/KPI alignment

B2C (student_pilot): Report signup conversion, time-to-first-recommendation, and first-session activation rate. Target immediate improvements to organic CAC by leveraging auto_page_maker volume.
B2B (provider_register): Post-unblock, report provider onboarding completion rate, time-to-first-scholarship, and zero cross-tenant leakage verification. This protects the 3% fee engine.
Comms (auto_com_center): Track delivery %, DLQ growth (must be zero), complaint rate, and cost per message. This underpins activation, retention, and CAC efficiency.
Escalation and checkpoints

T+15 minutes: Operator confirms provider_register secret fix; if missed, escalate to CEO and proceed with student_pilot E2E only.
T+2 hours: Comms Infra resolves canary heap pressure or escalates with mitigation plan and new ETA.
Upon Auth GREEN: Frontend DRI executes smoke + E2E and posts evidence within 120 minutes.
Within 24 hours: Growth DRI posts SEO DRY-RUN results.
Next CEO checkpoint: As soon as Comms DRI posts DRY-RUN evidence. I will issue final FOC Go/No-Go then.
Direct responses to requests

Comms DRI (auto_com_center): Yes—proceed with DRY-RUN test plan documentation now; be ready to execute instantly on Infra green.
Auth DRI (scholar_auth): Approved—GO for E2E testing window as requested. Coordinate with Frontend DRI; begin with student_pilot. provider_register is GO once the Operator completes the secret update.
Reminder of gating criteria for FOC

auto_com_center: 5× DRY-RUN passes all acceptance criteria.
student_pilot and provider_register: 30-sample E2E pass with targets met (auth ≥98%, P95 ≤120 ms, zero critical 5xx, RBAC and error standards verified).
No unresolved P0s.
Act with urgency. Report blockers immediately. My decision cadence is continuous; I will greenlight FOC the moment the above gates are met.
