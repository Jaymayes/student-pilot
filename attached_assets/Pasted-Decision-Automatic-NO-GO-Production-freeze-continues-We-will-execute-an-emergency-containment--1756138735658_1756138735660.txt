Decision: Automatic NO-GO. Production freeze continues.

We will execute an emergency containment-and-remediation plan now. Trust and data protection override schedule. Growth deployments remain frozen until all Critical and High issues are verifiably closed.

Immediate actions (start now)

Severity: SEV-1 security incident (active auth bypass)

0–2 hours: Containment

Disable exposure path
Kill /api/billing/balance in prod immediately: feature-flag off + app-level 403; add WAF rule to block /api/billing/* except authenticated requests; remove the route from router if needed.
Secrets and caches
Rotate all possibly exposed secrets (Stripe keys, JWT signing/refresh secrets, OAuth, 3rd-party API keys); invalidate affected sessions/tokens; purge CDN caches for dist assets.
Access and monitoring
Enable strict auth/authorization middleware on all billing endpoints; ship a hotfix to staging → canary → prod (flagged), with rollback ready.
Begin log review for any unauthorized access to billing balance; snapshot and preserve logs for forensics.
2–6 hours: High-risk code fixes

Auth bypass: Add explicit authorization checks and tests for /api/billing/balance and related endpoints; contract tests must require auth and correct scopes.
Secret scans: Remove any secrets from repo and build outputs; prove clean scans (repo + dist); document rotation status.
eval ban: Remove eval() from all code (including QA tooling); enforce ESLint/CI ban; prove 0 matches in repo and build.
6–24 hours: Complete High remediation

SQL injection: Replace all template-literal queries with parameterized/ORM calls; add lint rule to ban string-concat SQL; run negative injection tests and SAST.
Error handling: Add try/catch + rollback on async DB/billing functions; transient retry for recognized error codes; fault-injection tests must pass.
CORS: Implement allowlisted origins; verify preflights; endpoint contract tests must pass.
Validation and review

24–36 hours: Verification pass

Rerun full suite: qa-comprehensive-execution-report.json, secret scans (repo + dist), SAST/DAST, and negative tests for auth/SQLi.
Observability: Dashboards live for auth abuse (blocked/FP), billing reconciliation ($0 deltas), endpoint contract health, SSR error rate, p95 latency, error budget.
T+36 pre-read; T+48 Unfreeze Review (new)

Pre-read: Single link folder with verification rerun, deltas, secret-rotation evidence, CI gate outputs (eval/SQL bans, secret scans), WAF rules, rollback logs, Redis limiter metrics, reconciliation proof ($0), and feature-flag inventory.
War room: Opens 30 minutes pre-review; on-call primary/secondary confirmed.
Go/No-Go remains unchanged

Go only if: 0 Critical, 0 High; secret scans clean (repo + built assets); protected/public endpoints correct; SQLi tests blocked + SAST clean; SLOs stable (99.9% uptime, p95 within ±15%).
Otherwise: No-Go; freeze continues with a new ETA and plan.
Additional directives

Forensics and compliance: Open incident record now. If logs indicate exposure of personal/billing data, initiate privacy counsel review and notification assessment; do not publish externally unless required.
Temporary WAF hardening: Enable rules to block common SQLi patterns and unauthenticated access to billing paths while fixes land.
Communications: Prepare No-Go internal/status page template (do not send externally); partner assurance will only go out post-Go.
Accountability and cadence

2-hour checkpoint: Confirm /api/billing/balance blocked, keys rotated, CDN purged, WAF rules active.
6-hour checkpoint: Auth bypass fixed in staging; secret scans trending to 0; eval ban enforced.
24-hour checkpoint: All Critical/High closed in staging with passing tests.
Daily 9:00 AM SEV stand-up; EOD status to exec channel.
Quality over speed. Execute.
