Acknowledged. Thank you for the expanded QA results. Given our prime directive and that trust is a core product feature for our two‑sided marketplace, we will execute a 72‑hour Security and Reliability Hardening micro‑sprint in parallel with the Growth Sprint. This preserves release velocity while closing the gap to an A security grade and protecting monetization. Our AI Scholarship Playbook explicitly calls for a defense‑in‑depth posture and positions security as foundational to our brand and availability commitments, not a checkbox (trust as a core product feature; proactive cybersecurity) .

Executive decisions and directives (effective immediately)

Scope: Close all 5 high‑priority items and 2 runtime failures within 72 hours; reduce total open Medium items by 50% within 10 days.

Sensitive data logging (server/routes.ts) – stop PII/secret exposure
Policy: Adopt “deny-by-default” logging. Allowlist specific fields; mask tokens, emails, phone, addresses, IDs; never log raw request/response bodies for auth, billing, or file upload.
Implementation: Structured logging (e.g., JSON) with masking middleware; redaction at sink; correlation IDs; log sampling for high‑volume endpoints; 14/30/90‑day retention tiers by stream.
Testing/gates: Add CI rule to grep/block sensitive keys; replay RT‑015 to confirm redaction; add automated log-scrub unit tests.
Owner: Backend Lead. SLA: 24 hours.
2. Authentication rate limiting (server/replitAuth.ts) – brute‑force protection

Controls: Per‑IP and per‑account limits; exponential backoff with jitter; device/browser fingerprint hints; velocity checks (max attempts per minute/hour/day); soft lock + user notification; audit logging for auth anomalies.
UX: Clear error messaging; fallback path for legitimate users; support override workflow.
Metrics: Time‑series of blocked attempts; false positive rate; time‑to‑unlock SLA.
SLA: 48 hours.
3. Billing precision (server/billing.ts) – BigInt/Number consistency

Standard: Treat all amounts as integer minor units (cents) end‑to‑end; no float math; normalize on ingress/egress to Stripe; use Decimal/BigInt consistently.
Safeguards: Idempotency keys; double‑entry ledger events; reconciliation job vs Stripe balance transactions; unit tests for rounding edge cases.
SLA: 48 hours.
4. Database async error handling (server/storage.ts)

Patterns: Centralized error boundary for async ops; transaction rollback on exceptions; retry with exponential backoff for transient codes; circuit‑breaker around hot paths.
Observability: Structured error payloads without PII; SLO/error‑budget wired into dashboards.
SLA: 48 hours.
5. API client error handling (client/src/lib/queryClient.ts)

Resilience: Network-aware retries with capped backoff; offline queue for idempotent GETs; user‑visible status toasts; consistent error normalization for UI.
Telemetry: Client error taxonomy (network_timeout, 5xx, 4xx_validation); tie to funnel drop‑off analysis.
SLA: 48 hours.
6. RT‑018: Session SameSite protection

Cookie policy: SameSite=Lax (or Strict where viable), Secure, HttpOnly; explicit domain/path scope; rotation on privilege escalation; CSRF tokens for state-changing actions.
SLA: 24 hours.
Validation: Regression test for cross‑site flows and embedded contexts.
Exit criteria and KPIs

Security grade raised from B+ to A (internal scoring) within two weeks; zero open High > 3 days.
RT‑015/RT‑018 pass; automated checks in CI to prevent regression.
Auth abuse: ≥95% of brute‑force attempts blocked; false positives <0.5%.
Billing: $0 rounding diffs in reconciliation report; 100% idempotent charge create flows.
Error budget: No increase in p95 latency or error rate; uptime ≥99.9% maintained.
Ownership and resources

Backend Lead: logging redaction, rate limiting, billing precision, DB error handling.
Frontend Lead: queryClient resilience and UX feedback.
DevOps: CI gates for secret/PII scans; log sink redaction; dashboards/alerts.
QA/Sec: Re-run runtime validations; expand fuzz and negative auth tests; sign‑off.
Governance and cadence

Daily 15‑minute hardening stand‑up until closure; issues tracked under “Security & Reliability Hardening” epic.
Change management: Ship behind flags; canary deploy; rapid rollback plan.
Reporting: Exec channel EOD update with status, blockers, and KPI movement.
Strategic alignment

Hardening secures our growth engine by protecting user trust, payment integrity, and partner confidence—key to conversion and provider onboarding. This aligns with our playbook’s mandate for defense‑in‑depth and 24/7 reliability as a business pillar, not merely technical hygiene .
Requests to you (to unblock)

Confirm the latest locations of qa-analysis-report.json and qa-runtime-validation-report.json in our data store so Data/DevOps can ingest them into the executive dashboard and CI gates.
Provide baselines for: blocked login attempts/day, auth success rate, charge reconciliation deltas, and current error budget burn, so we can quantify improvement.
If you approve, I’ll greenlight the micro‑sprint now and hold owners to the 72‑hour SLA while continuing the Growth Sprint (SEO, conversion, provider MVP) without schedule slip.
