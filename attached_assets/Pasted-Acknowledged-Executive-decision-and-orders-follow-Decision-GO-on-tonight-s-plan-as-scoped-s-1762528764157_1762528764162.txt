Acknowledged. Executive decision and orders follow.

Decision: GO on tonight’s plan as scoped

scholarship_sage M2M bypass: Proceed exactly as planned.
scholarship_agent: Frozen, observe-only through Nov 9. No code changes.
WebSocket/HMR issue: Defer until post-gate; production HMR disabled after the gate.
Direct answer to your clarification

Yes: For scholarship_sage, “M2M bypass” means you will:
Call scholar_auth’s token endpoint directly with client_credentials (skip discovery).
Acquire read-only scopes, then make authenticated calls to scholarship_api.
Produce evidence of token lifecycle (mint, refresh, revoke), introspection, and JWKS verification.
No additional implementation is required beyond the bypass and evidence capture. Ensure scholarship_agent is not referenced anywhere in tonight’s flows.
What to execute next (with owners and deadlines, UTC)
Track 1 — scholarship_sage M2M bypass (Auth DRI + Sage DRI)

By 18:40: Post evidence of 3 successful grants (distinct request_id lineage) using read-only scopes, plus:
Token mint/refresh/revoke results with timestamps
Introspection output and exp claims
Proof that secrets are from Replit Secrets (screenshots/redacted env listing)
3 signed calls to scholarship_api with 200 responses and ≤120ms P95
By 19:15: Pre–war-room smoke re-test; attach results to TRACK_1_M2M_BYPASS_EVIDENCE.md
Track 2 — scholar_auth root fix + discovery stability (Auth DRI)

By 20:40: Discovery advertises authorization_code + PKCE S256 + client_credentials; health check green.
JWKS rotation rehearsal: 23:30–23:45 window
Rotate keys, verify new kid served at /.well-known/jwks.json
Validate old tokens continue to pass until expiry; attach logs
Evidence: AUTH_FIXLOG_2025-11-07.md containing:
P95 and 401/5xx rates during window
Zero hardcoded secrets confirmation
Protected-route redirects for student_pilot and provider_register
E2E gates (triggered on AUTH GREEN TAG at 00:00)

student_pilot (B2C DRI): By 00:30
95-step E2E with First Document Upload checkpoint visible
Cross-browser responsive check
Evidence: E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE with request_id lineage
provider_register (B2B DRI): By 01:00
ORDER_B: provider creation → scholarship publish → dashboard view
PKCE S256 proof, 3% fee transparency, ≤120ms P95
Evidence: ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md with request_id lineage
scholarship_api (API DRI): Within 1 hour of E2E
Append cross-app traces (auth→api→app) to ORDER_4 addendum
Enforce strict token validation; P95 ≤120ms, error ≤1%
Security and compliance hard lines

No hardcoded secrets anywhere; all creds via Replit Secrets.
PKCE S256 enforced for public clients; M2M scopes read-only for scholarship_sage.
Token lifecycle verified (mint/refresh/revoke) and JWKS rotation proof collected.
Request_ID lineage must span scholar_auth → scholarship_api → app.
FERPA/COPPA posture: No PII beyond minimum necessary; logging excludes sensitive fields.
Stop-the-line criteria (auto page to Incident Commander)

P95 >120ms sustained 10 minutes on any critical path
Error rate >1% over 5-minute rolling window
Token issuance or validation failures >0.5% over 10 minutes
JWKS rotation breaks validation for any in-flight tokens
KPIs to capture tonight (ties to ARR plan)

B2C: First Document Upload activation rate and time-to-activation
B2B: Provider ORDER_B completion rate; scholarship publish-to-dashboard latency
Auth: Conversion funnel success (auth → token → API) and P95
Platform: Availability ≥99.9%, error ≤1%
Your question on proceeding with AUTH_FIXLOG: Approved. Proceed now. Include P95, 401/5xx snapshots, and the JWKS rotation rehearsal.

Final confirmation

Scope: Correct and locked.
M2M bypass testing for scholarship_sage: Execute now and deliver pre–war-room evidence.
AUTH_FIXLOG evidence package: Build and post by 00:00.
E2E evidence deadlines: 00:30 (student_pilot), 01:00 (provider_register).
I will hold us to the above acceptance criteria at the 20:00–01:00 UTC war room and will call GO/NO-GO at 00:00 based on AUTH GREEN TAG evidence.
