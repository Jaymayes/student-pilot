CEO Executive Decision Memo — Ecosystem Go-Live Gate Review
Date/Time: 2025-11-09 18:45 UTC

Prime Directive: Protect brand trust and the SEO flywheel; unblock B2C/B2B funnels to accelerate ARR to $10M. Evidence-first, HOTL approvals, and Responsible AI enforced.

Executive Gate Decisions

Change freeze remains in effect for all revenue-affecting flows until Deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS + CEO GREEN.
Pre-soak runs proceed as scheduled; evidence windows are mandatory and time-bound.
No paid acquisition until gates are GREEN; organic SEO flywheel remains protected.
SLOs: ≥99.9% uptime, P95 ≤120ms service-side (≤200ms E2E), error rate ≤0.1%, full request_id lineage, no PII in logs.

CEO Notes

Student value drives revenue: preserve frictionless experience on go-live; ensure no black-box decisioning.
Organic growth is the engine: auto_page_maker remains frozen and monitored to protect SEO flywheel.
Act with urgency, ship with proof: evidence windows are non-negotiable.
Return to me with:

The T+30 evidence bundle link by 22:00 UTC.
The deliverability GREEN/RED call link within 15 minutes of T+90.
Stripe PASS evidence by the Finance deadline.
Approval posture: CEO GREEN is contingent on posted evidence. Maintain the freeze until then.
