Acknowledged. Day‑2 results are strong and data hygiene confirmed. Keep execution tight and SEO‑led.

Executive decisions for Day‑3

Budget and pacing
Hold daily budget at $300 (rolling 24h) with 30/30/40 pacing.
Segment mix (next 24h): 60% Checkout Abandoners, 30% Upload Abandoners, 10% Essay/Transcript Viewers (auto‑pause this cohort if CAC > $8 for 6h).
Creative plan
Maintain “Complete your app” at 70%.
Run “Last Chance Match” as challenger at 20% with kill: CTR ≥30% below control or CAC ≥25% above cohort for 6h after 500 impressions.
Introduce a single new benefit‑led variant (“Resume your upload in 2 clicks”) at 10%; same kill rules.
Funnel and pricing experiments (low‑risk, 10% traffic each)
First‑Upload UX: sticky “Resume upload” CTA + prefilled step state; success metric = upload completion rate and credit conversion.
Credit pack framing test (keep 4x markup): show 1‑pack baseline vs value‑pack nudge (3‑pack anchor). Report ARPU lift; auto‑disable on refund spike (+1% in 24h).
Cost and SLO guardrails
Keep analyze queue_depth < 30 and P95 ≤ 1.5s; if breached for 15 min, auto‑throttle non‑revenue tasks by 50% and page Ops + Finance.
Platform spend projection must stay ≤ $300; if > $300 for 1h, enable throttle and cut exploratory creative to 0% until back under cap.
Provider ops (close Week‑1 gap)
Target: +7 providers and +12 listings in next 48h. Priority outreach to checkout‑abandoning providers; ensure 3% fee instrumentation recorded.
Compliance and hygiene
Retargeting‑only; no prospecting.
Minors DoNotSell=true, 0 PII in logs, daily API‑key spot checks.
Reporting required

Day‑3 T+12h and T+24h pilot reports:
Spend, CAC, ARPU7, ARPU:CAC, refunds/fraud, Stripe success, auto‑pauses.
Segment/creative table with actions taken and results.
Funnel (visitor→signup→upload→paid) and SEO share.
Pricing/Funnel experiment outcomes and ARPU impact.
Friday KPI 1‑pager:
SLOs; revenue split (B2C/B2B); ARPU and margin; SEO net pages + CTR; funnel deltas; cost drivers; provider progress; next week’s ROI‑ranked experiments.
Scale criteria (do not change budget until 72h pilot complete)

Consider $300→$400 only if last 24h: CAC ≤ $7, ARPU7 ≥ 2.0× CAC, refunds ≤ 3%, Stripe ≥ 98.5%, no incidents. Prepare evidence; no step‑up without explicit CEO authorization.
Stay on CAC ≤ $8 trajectory, protect ≥60% margin, and keep organic sessions ≥85%. Proceed with Day‑3 plan and reports on schedule.
