Acknowledged. Fleet is GREEN and we’re in the final mile. Here’s what I’ll prepare and what you need to do next so we capture revenue while DNS propagates.

What I’ll deliver now (ready to execute)

T+48h provider “final reminder” package (send-gated)
Trigger: Only if A6 /health remains 200 AND no provider_connected for the provider by T+48h.
Fresh link workflow: Generate per-provider Stripe Connect link just before send (use your onboard/refresh endpoint), store message_id, and suppress if bounce/complaint exists; cap 1 marketing email per 24h.
Subject options: “Final reminder: Complete your payout setup to go live” or “Action required today: Finish setup to publish your scholarships”
Body:
Hi [First name],
We still need your secure payout details to list your scholarships and receive applications. Please finish Stripe Connect (about 5 minutes):
Complete setup now: [PERSONALIZED_STRIPE_LINK]
Once complete, your scholarships go live immediately and you’ll unlock full analytics.
Need help? Reply and I’ll walk you through it on a 10–15 minute call.
Thanks, [Your Name] — Scholar AI Advisor
Compliance: Include unsubscribe + mailing address; throttle if complaint rate >0.2%.
A3 hero CTA A/B variant (if provider clicks <10 at T+24h)
Variant A: “Recruit Your Next Scholar” — Start in 5 minutes. Publish your scholarship, receive matched applicants today.
Variant B: “Launch a Scholarship in Minutes” — Verified applicants, built‑in screening, secure payouts.
Link: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/?utm_source=scholarship_agent&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=provider_acquisition_ab
Telemetry: cta_click with audience=provider, variant={A|B}, plus UTM echo.
A8 dashboards and alerts (ready to apply)
Tiles: A1 discovery/JWKS p50/p95; A5 /api/login dns/tls/ttfb/total p50/p95; A3 provider CTA clicks (24h sum and 6h rate); A6 provider_connected and listing_created (24h sum).
Alerts (2-window dampening): A1 config latency warn 150ms, crit 200ms; A5 /api/login warn 200ms p95, crit 350ms; A6 /health 5xx warn >1%, crit >2% in 15min; A3 provider CTA warn <10 by T+24h, crit 0 by T+48h.
What you do next (fast, manual steps)

Add www domain in A7 (to activate your 301 in prod)
Replit → Deployments → auto_page_maker → Custom Domains → add www.scholaraiadvisor.com
After 5–60 minutes:
curl -I https://www.scholaraiadvisor.com → expect HTTP/2 301 Location: https://scholaraiadvisor.com/…
curl -I https://scholaraiadvisor.com → expect HTTP/2 200
GSC: Inspect a www URL (should show Redirected). Resubmit https://scholaraiadvisor.com/sitemap.xml
Confirm A6 redeploy (done) and keep it green
Already healthy: /health 200, /auth/login 302 with PKCE S256. I’ll watch for provider_connected events.
Live watch (next 24–48h)

A1: discovery/JWKS p95 ≤150ms for 3 windows (post‑cache warm).
A5: /api/login p95 ≤200ms and p50 ≤120ms sustained for 24h.
A3: provider CTA clicks ≥25 in 24–48h; if <10 at T+24h, I’ll stage the hero CTA variant.
A6: ≥2 provider_connected events in 48h; if none by T+48h, I’ll queue final reminder emails with fresh Stripe links.
Tell me when:

www.scholaraiadvisor.com is added (I’ll run the curl checks and prompt GSC sitemap resubmit).
You want me to stage the T+48h provider reminders with fresh Stripe links (I’ll hold the send until the trigger conditions are met).
