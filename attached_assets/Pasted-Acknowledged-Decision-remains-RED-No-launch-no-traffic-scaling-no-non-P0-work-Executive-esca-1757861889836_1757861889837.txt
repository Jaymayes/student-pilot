Acknowledged. Decision remains RED. No launch, no traffic scaling, no non-P0 work.

Executive escalation and orders (effective immediately)

Single owner: CTO is Incident Commander. 24/7 war-room. Hourly Slack updates; 4-hour executive checkpoints with evidence IDs.
Ship freeze: All non-P0 development and marketing spend paused for 72 hours.
Auto-revert authorized: Roll back to last known-good DB migration tag and app build if P0 closure is not demonstrated within 8 hours.
P0 closure plan with deadlines and acceptance criteria

DB schema integrity — DUE T+8h (Owner: DBA lead)
Fix: Restore cohort_users and reconcile migration drift.
Acceptance: 0 occurrences of 42P01 for 24h; dependent queries succeed; migration report ID and app log IDs attached.
2. Analytics/BI availability — DUE T+12h (Owner: Frontend + Analytics)

Fix: Null-safety guards in TtvDashboardTile; API returns numeric values or explicit 0s (never null).
Acceptance: Dashboard renders without exceptions; payload fields non-null; trace IDs provided.
3. Revenue observability — DUE T+12h (Owner: Backend)

Fix: Read-only ARR summary (B2C/B2B/Total) exposed from existing data or cached job output; auth-protected; no writes.
Acceptance: arr_b2c_usd, arr_b2b_usd, arr_total_usd populated with timestamp and report/log IDs.
4. SLO recovery — DUE T+24h (Owner: SRE/Infra)

Fix: Identify and remediate slow paths; enable APM and error aggregation; add caching/N+1 guards.
Acceptance: P95 ≤ 250ms and error rate ≤ 1.0% for 24h; plan documented to reach P95 ≤ 120ms and error ≤ 0.1% in 72h.
P1 hygiene (parallel; non-blocking)

security.txt must serve text/plain — DUE T+4h (Owner: Security).
SEO scale plan beyond 155 URLs ready once SLOs stabilize — DUE T+72h (Owner: Growth Eng).
Move-to-Yellow gate (all must pass)

No schema errors (e.g., 42P01) for 24h.
MAU, conversion, ARR are non-null and logged daily.
P95 ≤ 250ms and error rate ≤ 1.0% for 24h; path to 120ms/0.1% defined.
Read-only ARR summary accessible to execs.
SLO dashboard and on-call alerts live with named owners.
Copy-paste prompt — 24h Red→Yellow Gate Check (read-only)
Read-Only Red→Yellow Gate Check — ScholarshipAI Student Pilot
Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Strict read-only. Do not modify data, configs, jobs, or integrations. Use only existing telemetry, logs, stored reports, and read-only endpoints. If any metric is missing, return UNKNOWN and list the minimal instrumentation to collect it.

Objective
Verify closure of P0 blockers and decide whether to move from RED to YELLOW. Provide PASS/WARN/FAIL with evidence IDs and a go/no-go decision.

Checks and required evidence
A) DB schema integrity

Expect: 0 occurrences of 42P01 (or equivalent) in last 24h; cohort_users accessible to the app.
Evidence: latest app/migration logs (IDs, timestamps); dependent query success logs.
B) Analytics/BI availability

Expect: TtvDashboardTile renders; MAU, conversion, ARPU, medianTTV, p95TTV are non-null (numeric or zero).
Evidence: dashboard render trace IDs; sample API payload with fields and timestamps.
C) Revenue observability

Expect: Read-only ARR summary visible (B2C, B2B, Total) with timestamp.
Evidence: report name/ID, last-generated timestamp, values.
D) SLO performance (last 24h)

Expect: P95 ≤ 250ms; error rate ≤ 1.0%; show P50/P95/P99.
Evidence: performance dashboard/log IDs and distribution snapshot.
E) Security parity

Expect: HSTS/CSP/X-Frame-Options present; /.well-known/security.txt returns 200 with content-type text/plain.
Evidence: header capture and endpoint status.
F) SEO sanity

Expect: Valid sitemap; URL count; no critical XML errors.
Evidence: sitemap fetch log ID and validator reference.
G) Guardrails

Expect: Agent Bridge disabled or dry-run; no autonomous campaigns.
Evidence: config/status report ID.
KPIs to report (UNKNOWN = FAIL for MAU, conversion, or ARR)

MAU (28d, 90d), conversion rate, ARPU, ARR (B2C/B2B/Total), P95 latency (24h), error rate (24h), indexed pages.
Output format

Executive summary (5–8 bullets) with decision: Green/Yellow/Red.
KPI table: Current, Target, Variance%, Status (PASS/WARN/FAIL).
A–G results with PASS/WARN/FAIL and evidence IDs (log or report names + timestamps).
Endpoint health table: /health, /sitemap.xml, /.well-known/security.txt, analytics endpoints.
JSON: { "timestamp": "...", "instance": "...", "issues": {...}, "kpis": {...}, "decision": {"status": "Green|Yellow|Red", "justification": "...", "blockers": [{"owner": "", "eta_days": 0}]} }
If this gate fails again, we extend the freeze, execute auto-revert to last known-good schema/build, and reassign owners.
