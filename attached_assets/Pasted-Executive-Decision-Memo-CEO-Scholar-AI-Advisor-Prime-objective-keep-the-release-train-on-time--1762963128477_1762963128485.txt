Executive Decision Memo — CEO, Scholar AI Advisor
Prime objective: keep the release train on time, hit tonight’s Gate windows, and protect ARR ignition Nov 13–15 with low risk and full compliance.

Portfolio decisions and directives

Email provider strategy
Decision: Stay on Postmark. No pivot to SendGrid.
Rationale: All targets passed (SPF/DKIM/DMARC PASS, 100% inbox placement on seed tests, P95 <100ms).
Action: Keep SendGrid contingency parked and retain documentation. Do not activate unless a material regression occurs.
2. Gate windows and ownership

Agent3 remains DRI for auto_com_center and Release Captain for tonight’s portfolio gates.
Gate A (auto_com_center) 20:00–20:15 UTC: Proceed as planned. Pass criteria are unchanged: ≥95% inbox placement, P95 ≤120ms, error rate ≤0.1%, authentication PASS, webhooks firing.
Gate B (provider_register) 18:00–18:15 UTC: Agent3 to issue PASS/FAIL by 18:20 UTC based on DRI evidence. If evidence is missing or fails criteria, escalate immediately with remediation ETA.
Gate C (scholar_auth) 20:00–20:15 UTC: Proceed. Pass criteria: P95 ≤120ms, 99.9% auth success, MFA + SSO verified, RBAC enforced, audit logs enabled.
3. student_pilot compliance

Status stays blocked for production until Legal signs ToS/Privacy and COPPA language. Do not enable age-gate or collect data on under-13s until legal sign-off. If Legal slips past 18:00 UTC, student_pilot production enablement automatically moves to Nov 13, 16:00 UTC.
4. Release Captain API 404 issue

Deprioritize until after gates. Use the published evidence directories and checksums for Gate decisions tonight. Open a ticket and remediate routes during the off-peak window after 23:00 UTC.
5. Deliverability hardening plan

DMARC policy: remain p=none for 24–48 hours of production monitoring; then move to p=quarantine; target p=reject by day 7 if telemetry remains green.
Add BIMI planning to backlog (logo asset, VMC) as an incremental trust booster.
Ensure bounce/complaint webhooks are streaming to our BI sink and alerting is on for complaint rate >0.1% in any 15-minute window.
6. Security and audit

Confirm audit log retention (≥1 year) and SIEM forwarding tonight for auth, email events, and admin actions.
Confirm DPA and data maps are current; capture the Postmark and SendGrid (contingency) subprocessor entries.
7. ARR ignition plan remains on track

Conditions to greenlight scholarship_agent warm-up: Gate A pass, Gate C pass, Legal sign-off, CEO greenlight. Earliest possible greenlight remains Nov 13.
KPI focus: inbox placement ≥95%, unsubscribe <0.5%, complaint <0.1%, CTR benchmarks by campaign type, student credit ARPU and conversion uptick post-onboarding email n.
Per-app status reports (Section V format)

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (scheduled execution at Gate A, 20:00–20:15 UTC)

Confirmation: SPF/DKIM/DMARC PASS, seed-list 100% inbox placement, API P95 <100ms, webhook endpoint live.
Evidence: Readiness and pivot decision artifacts published with SHA-256.
Actions: Execute Gate A. Publish evidence bundle within 30 minutes of window close. Maintain Postmark as primary; keep SendGrid contingency parked.
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (pending Gate B evidence)

Blockers: Awaiting DRI evidence bundle for 18:00–18:15 UTC.
Next steps: Agent3 to issue PASS/FAIL by 18:20 UTC. If FAIL or no evidence, escalate with remediation plan and revised ETA.
ARR relevance: Provider activation is a direct driver of GMV and 3% platform fee; keep this on the critical path.
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (subject to Gate C verification at 20:00–20:15 UTC)

Requirements: MFA enabled, SSO tested, RBAC scoped, audit logs confirmed, P95 ≤120ms, uptime 99.9%.
Actions: Execute Gate C and publish evidence within 30 minutes post-window. Ensure SIEM integration and retention policies confirmed tonight.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Observer Mode; sends blocked)

Conditions to lift block: Gate A PASS + Gate C PASS + Legal sign-off + CEO greenlight.
Evidence: Health, metrics, OpenAPI, and fairness telemetry in place. Warm-up plan staged (14–21 days).
Actions: Remain in Observer Mode until greenlight. Prepare day-1 warm-up cohorts and suppression rules.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (compliance hold)

Blockers: Legal sign-off on ToS/Privacy and COPPA language.
Estimated Go-Live: Nov 13, 16:00 UTC (if Legal completes today).
ARR ignition: Nov 13–15 window, aligned to credit sales at 4x markup and B2C funnel readiness.
Additional checkpoints tonight

20:45 UTC CEO review: Gate A/C evidence. If green, authorize scholarship_agent warm-up prep steps, pending Legal.
22:15 UTC auto_page_maker canary review: p75 CWV GREEN, P95 ≤120ms, IndexNow >95%, sitemaps valid. This supports our organic growth engine and LTV:CAC thesis.
23:00 UTC consolidated evidence package to scholarship_sage with KPIs, SHA-256 checksums, and audit trails.
Clarifications to Agent3

Repository scope: Continue execution in auto_com_center as DRI for Gate A. Coordinate provider_register Gate B as Release Captain via evidence bundles and async comms. Do not context-switch away from Gate A during the 19:45–20:30 UTC critical window.
If provider_register evidence is late or incomplete at 18:15 UTC, escalate immediately; do not jeopardize Gate A/C focus window.
Final note on risk and ethics

Maintain “Responsible AI” posture: no academic dishonesty facilitation, transparent rationale logging, bias checks active. Keep all compliance gates enforceable and auditable.
You have my go to proceed exactly as outlined above. Keep me posted at 18:20, 20:30, and 23:00 UTC with concise, SHA-verified evidence summaries and a one-line Go/No-Go per gate.
