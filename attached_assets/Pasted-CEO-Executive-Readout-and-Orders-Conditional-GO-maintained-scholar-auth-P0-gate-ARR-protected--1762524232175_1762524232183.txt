CEO Executive Readout and Orders — Conditional GO maintained; scholar_auth P0 gate, ARR protected

Prime directive alignment

Objective unchanged: execute toward $10M profitable ARR with market leadership in AI-driven scholarship access. Today’s decisions prioritize low-CAC compound growth, evidence-first readiness, and student value.
Executive Go/No-Go

Portfolio decision: Conditional GO remains in force, gated by scholar_auth GREEN TAG at Nov 8, 00:00 UTC.
ARR ignition: Nov 12 remains ON, protected by non-auth SEO compounding and provider waitlist intake.
P0 gate: scholar_auth

Application: scholar_auth | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Two-track fix authorized immediately.
Track A (primary, 12:00–18:00 UTC): Direct configuration override to expose client_credentials in OIDC discovery. Acceptance: .well-known discovery lists supported grant_types incl. client_credentials; token, introspection, revocation endpoints functional; JWKS rotates; PKCE S256 for auth code; refresh token and revocation verified; protected-route redirects proven from student_pilot/provider_register/scholarship_agent.
Track B (fallback, ready to cut over within 30 minutes): Express route override to serve corrected discovery with enforced server-side validations. Same acceptance criteria as Track A.
Evidence due (non-negotiable) by Nov 8, 00:00 UTC:
AUTH GREEN TAG package: discovery proof, PKCE S256, client_credentials, token mint/refresh/revoke, session expiry, key rotation, protected-route redirects, change diff with timestamps, rollback plan.
Miss handling: If GREEN TAG not delivered by 00:00 UTC, execute Contingency A within 30 minutes and re-target 12:00 UTC hard stop for auth.
Ready, blocked on auth

Application: student_pilot | APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Order: Run 95-step E2E within 30 minutes of auth GREEN. Deliver E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md (cross-browser, first document upload activation, request_id correlation, P95 ≤120ms, <0.1% error, 0% auth failures).
Application: provider_register | APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Order: Execute ORDER_B within 30 minutes of auth GREEN. Deliver ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md (client/server validation, 3% fee transparency, request_id lineage, publish-to-dashboard flow, P95 ≤120ms, 100% auth success).
Operational, green and frozen

Application: auto_page_maker | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Order: Maintain freeze; continue daily 06:00 UTC rollups through Nov 12 (IndexNow ≥95%, CWV p75 GREEN, 0% error, P95 ≤120ms, uptime ≥99.9%). Keep graceful degradation and lead capture ON. This is our CAC-lean ARR protection.
Application: scholarship_api | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Order: Maintain freeze (schema/RBAC/config). Within 1 hour after student_pilot E2E, post ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md with cross-app traces (auth→api→app), latency P95, error budget, and token validation logs.
Application: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Order: Auto-apply remains OFF through Nov 9. Deliver FAIRNESS_24H_SUMMARY_2025-11-10 by Nov 10, 12:00 UTC.
Yellow dependency

Application: scholarship_sage | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Current blocker: M2M secret absent.
Orders: Start M2M baseline within 15 minutes of secret arrival and deliver baseline evidence by Nov 8, 16:00 UTC with request_id lineage and safety proof. Re-check for secret at 11:45 UTC and 17:45 UTC; escalate if still missing.
External comms infra

Application: auto_com_center | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Orders: Complete DNS verification by Nov 8, 12:00 UTC; confirm SQS credentials by Nov 8, 16:00 UTC. If delays occur, operate Email-only with SPF/DKIM/DMARC aligned and seed inbox deliverability proof (≥95% inbox rate, spam rate <0.2%). No impact to auth gate.
Risk management and contingency

P0 risk: scholar_auth GREEN TAG by Nov 8, 00:00 UTC. War-room authorized from 20:00–01:00 UTC around the gate with 30-minute checkpoint cadence.
Contingency A (pre-armed): If gate missed, move to closed-beta degraded mode within 30 minutes:
Keep non-auth surfaces live (auto_page_maker + student_pilot lead capture + provider waitlist).
Pause logged-in E2E/ORDER_B; protect ARR via SEO compounding.
New auth deadline: Nov 8, 12:00 UTC hard stop.
Contingency B (if needed): Web-only PKCE, limited client roster until full parity; decision at +12h if required.
Responsible AI gates (precondition to auto-apply)

scholarship_agent fairness and scholarship_sage safety must be GREEN.
Minimum thresholds (first pass): selection parity 0.8–1.25 across key segments; FPR by segment ≤2%; rationale coverage ≥95% with transparent matchReasons; manual override path available; no PII leakage.
Evidence: FAIRNESS_24H_SUMMARY_2025-11-10; Sage baseline metrics by Nov 8, 16:00 UTC.
Financial and KPI guardrails

CAC: Organic-only through Nov 12; no paid experiments.
ARPU: 7-day sensitivity mini-forecast due Nov 10 with confidence bands and conversion assumptions; include first-document-upload activation as leading indicator.
Margins: Maintain 4x AI services markup and 3% provider fee; no emergency cost increases.
KPI dashboards (daily 06:00 UTC through Nov 12): traffic, indexation, CWV, auth success rate, E2E pass rate, P95 per app, error budget, lead volume, provider waitlist adds, activation funnel.
Compliance and security

FERPA/COPPA posture: No PII in evidence artifacts or logs; immediate token revocation working; session expiry verified; protected-route redirects enforced.
Key rotation: Demonstrate KID rollover in JWKS and live token acceptance behavior.
On-call and accountability

Deliver on-call roster with names, roles, channels, and Nov 8–13 coverage in tomorrow’s 06:00 UTC brief.
DRIs retain stop-the-line authority if SLOs or safety thresholds are breached.
What I expect next

12:00 UTC today: Auth interim evidence + risk call; Sage M2M status; confirm war-room setup for the 00:00 UTC gate.
00:00 UTC Nov 8: AUTH GREEN TAG evidence package (non-negotiable).
00:30–01:00 UTC Nov 8: student_pilot E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md and provider_register ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md.
12:00/16:00 UTC Nov 8: auto_com_center DNS/SQS confirmations; scholarship_sage baseline evidence.
06:00 UTC daily through Nov 12: Consolidated readiness brief with KPI snapshot.
Student value is business value. Execute with urgency, maintain the freeze, and ship only with evidence.
