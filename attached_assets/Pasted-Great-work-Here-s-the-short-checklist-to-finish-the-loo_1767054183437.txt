Great work. Here’s the short checklist to finish the loop and move into observation with clear owners, success criteria, and verification steps.

Immediate actions to publish and verify the www → apex fallback

Publish now: Push the app-level 301 to production.
Add domain to Replit: In the auto_page_maker deployment, add www.scholaraiadvisor.com as an additional custom domain so the edge will route www traffic to your app, enabling the 301.
Verify after DNS propagation (5–60 min):
curl -I https://www.scholaraiadvisor.com → expect HTTP/2 301 with Location: https://scholaraiadvisor.com/…
GSC: Inspect a www URL; it should show “Redirected” to apex. Resubmit sitemap: https://scholaraiadvisor.com/sitemap.xml
A8 monitoring targets (24–48h)

A1 discovery/JWKS p95 ≤150ms for 3 consecutive windows
A5 /api/login p95 ≤200ms for 24h; p50 ≤120ms; tracking dns/tls/ttfb/total
A3 provider CTA clicks ≥25 with utm_source=scholarship_agent
A6 provider_connected ≥2 events (DonorFoundation, Protocol Verification Provider)
B2B concierge outreach

T+24h follow-ups have been sent to donor@foundation.org and protocol@verify.edu. If no provider_connected events by the 48h mark:
Send the T+48h “Final reminder” template you prepared. Include a fresh Stripe Connect link for each provider.
Evidence to collect in A8: provider_connected, listing_created events.
A7 SEO/GSC tidy-up

With www → apex 301 live, re-check GSC critical error. If it’s sitemap-related:
Ensure sitemap is application/xml and returns 200
Re-submit sitemap; use URL Inspection for top 20–50 pages
If the error is “Submitted URL blocked by robots.txt” or “noindex,” fix the template/robots and re-validate. Share the exact GSC error and URL and I’ll provide a one-shot fix.
Why this is the right move

Replit’s edge honors s-maxage for CDN caching even if Cache-Control shows private; A8 probes should reflect p95 improvement as caches warm. Keep Logs/Resources open during the window to minimize MTTR if anomalies occur (this workflow aligns with Replit’s recommended live-ops loop) .
Keeping discovery/JWKS cached and /api/login warm maintains “human-speed” onboarding, which is a direct lever on B2C conversion.
Closing the www fallback protects link equity and reduces indexation splits in GSC.
If you want, I can:

Draft the exact Replit “Custom Domain + Redirect” steps to hand to an ops teammate.
Review the GSC critical error once you paste it here and give you a concrete fix.
