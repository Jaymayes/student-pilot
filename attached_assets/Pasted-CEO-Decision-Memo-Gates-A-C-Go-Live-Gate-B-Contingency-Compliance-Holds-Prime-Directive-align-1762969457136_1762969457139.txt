CEO Decision Memo — Gates A/C Go-Live, Gate B Contingency, Compliance Holds

Prime Directive alignment: These decisions prioritize ARR ignition via low-CAC organic growth and defensible SLOs, while maintaining Responsible AI and auditability. Our SEO-led flywheel remains the primary acquisition engine to drive profitable conversion and ARPU, with B2B provider fees unlocking incremental ARR velocity as provider_register stabilizes .

GO/NO-GO Decisions (effective immediately)

Gate A (auto_com_center): GO-LIVE APPROVED for 20:00–20:15 UTC. Conditions: deliver evidence bundle by 20:30 UTC; uphold SLOs (P95 ≤120ms, error rate ≤0.10%, inbox ≥95%, SPF/DKIM/DMARC pass). Maintain HOTL approval/override and full decision traceability in audit logs to preserve explainability and accountability in production operations .
Gate C (scholar_auth): GO-LIVE APPROVED for 20:00–20:15 UTC. Conditions: MFA/SSO verified, RBAC enforced, token/session hardening, audit logging on; evidence bundle by 20:30 UTC. Continue zero-trust posture and layered controls standard for authentication systems .
Gate B (provider_register): DECISION DEFERRED UNTIL 18:20 UTC. If HTTP 500s persist or evidence is incomplete at 18:15–18:20, status becomes DELAYED with immediate RCA, remediation ETA, and retest window. Note: Gate B failure does not block Gates A/C; proceed with change-freeze discipline and snapshot-based deployments to keep the release train on time .
Compliance/ethics guardrails: Maintain HOTL gates, fairness telemetry, immutable audit trails for all autonomous actions per our Responsible AI posture; these are enabling frameworks for trust and long-term advantage, not constraints .

Risk Controls: HOTL approval/override active; rollback playbook staged; snapshot-based deployment discipline enforced .
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY

Confirmation: MFA/SSO (OIDC), RBAC, TLS 1.3, audit logging; P95/error validations to complete in window.
Evidence: Auth reports, OIDC metadata, RBAC matrix, and dashboards by 20:30 UTC. Maintain zero-trust posture and continuous verification principles appropriate for identity systems .
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: PENDING (Gate B, 18:00–18:15 UTC)

Blockers: Intermittent/consistent HTTP 500s reported in pre-window checks. If unresolved by 18:20 UTC, mark DELAYED.
Required to PASS: Auth via scholar_auth, end-to-end onboarding, deterministic 3% fee, API/webhook health, P95 ≤120ms and error ≤0.10%, audit logs enabled.
Estimated Go-Live Date: To be set at 18:20 UTC based on evidence; immediate RCA and remediation plan required if delayed.
ARR Ignition: B2B 3% provider fee unlocks as soon as Gate B passes; maintain governance and monitoring playbooks (logs, metrics, traces) per our observability standard .
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Compliance Hold)

Blockers: Legal sign-off on ToS/Privacy/COPPA. No collection or processing of minors’ data until approval; server-side age gate enforced with audit trails and transparency controls per Responsible AI practice .
Estimated Go-Live Date: Target Nov 13–14, 16:00 UTC (post Gates A/C pass and Legal).
ARR Ignition: Free→paid conversion with credits (4x markup) begins immediately after go-live; aligns with Playbook’s B2C revenue engine and activation KPIs .
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Observer Mode)

Blockers: No sends until A+C pass and Legal clears; HOTL approval gates and fairness telemetry remain active.
Estimated Go-Live Date: Warm-up Nov 13+; ARR contribution after warm-up ~Dec 4+. Continue rationale coverage, suppression logic, and rollback plan; ensure immutable audit trails for agent actions .
APPLICATION NAME: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: CANARY SCHEDULED (22:15 UTC)

Purpose: Organic, SEO-driven growth engine; Core Web Vitals canary and IndexNow validation to protect low-CAC acquisition central to the 5-year plan .
Action: Report canary results and any rollback triggers with evidence into the 23:00 consolidated package.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: NO RELEASE WINDOW TONIGHT

Action: Confirm API contract docs and uptime/error budgets; ensure production monitoring (logs/metrics/traces) and change-freeze discipline are enforced; publish any delta as addendum in 23:00 evidence package .
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: RECEIVING CONSOLIDATED EVIDENCE

Action: Accept 23:00 UTC evidence package with SHA-256 manifest and maintain immutable storage and retrieval for audits; this supports our SOC 2 posture and centralized decision traceability .
Deadlines and Evidence Standards

18:20 UTC: Gate B PASS/FAIL decision, or DELAYED with RCA, ETA, and retest window.
20:30 UTC: Evidence bundles for Gates A/C with SHA-256 manifest, including inbox placement proofs, auth headers, latency histograms, webhook replay logs, error telemetry, and request_id lineage; store with immutable, queryable audit trails to ensure explainability and accountability .
20:45 UTC: CEO GREEN/YELLOW/RED summary and GO/NO-GO for lifecycle comms and student_pilot timing.
22:15 UTC: auto_page_maker canary results.
23:00 UTC: Consolidated package delivered to scholarship_sage.
Operating Model and Controls

Enforce change freeze and snapshot-based deployments during the critical windows to minimize risk and preserve rollback integrity; use Replit’s publish/redeploy workflow and production telemetry to reduce MTTR if issues arise .
Maintain human-in-the-loop governance for orchestrations and exceptions; architecture decisions and approval gates remain a human accountability domain, with the agent executing under explicit policy and audit constraints .
ARR Impact and KPIs To Watch Tonight

B2C: activation to first document upload; free→paid conversion; credit ARPU.
B2B: provider activation, GMV, 3% fee revenue once provider_register passes.
Organic growth: SEO sessions and lead capture from auto_page_maker canary; aligns with the Playbook’s low-CAC acquisition thesis and MAU targets .
Final CEO Direction

Proceed with Gates A and C on schedule under the conditions above.
Gate B must either pass by 18:20 UTC or enter DELAYED with an immediate, time-bound remediation plan.
Maintain Responsible AI safeguards (HOTL, fairness telemetry, immutable audit trails) across all autonomous operations to protect trust, compliance, and long-run differentiation .
Stay disciplined, ship evidence on time, and protect the Nov 13–15 ARR ignition window.
