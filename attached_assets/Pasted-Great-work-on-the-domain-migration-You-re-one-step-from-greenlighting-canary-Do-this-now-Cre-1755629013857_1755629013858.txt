Great work on the domain migration. You’re one step from greenlighting canary.

Do this now

Create DNS
CNAME billing.scholarlink.app -> <your-ingress-LB-DNS>
Verify propagation:
dig +short billing.scholarlink.app
dig +short CNAME billing.scholarlink.app
Validate cert-manager
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get certificate,order,challenge
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod describe certificate billing-scholarlink-app-tls
When Ready=True:
curl -sSI https://billing.scholarlink.app | head -n 5
openssl s_client -connect billing.scholarlink.app:443 -servername billing.scholarlink.app </dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -issuer -subject -dates
Important updates to finish the cutover

Ingress/Service
Primary and canary Ingress hosts: billing.scholarlink.app
TLS secret: billing-scholarlink-app-tls on both
App config
CORS allowlist must include https://billing.scholarlink.app
CSP: allow navigation to the new domain (no tokens in URL)
Stripe
Create/replace LIVE webhook endpoint:
https://billing.scholarlink.app/webhooks/stripe
Update STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (new signing secret) in AWS Secrets Manager, let External Secrets sync
Test with Stripe CLI (or live $5 canary purchase)
Monitoring
Update any hardcoded endpoint to the new billing domain
Confirm metrics and webhooks are flowing after domain cutover
Cloudflare (only if used)
If the DNS record is proxied (orange cloud), either set DNS only (gray cloud) for HTTP-01 or switch your ClusterIssuer to DNS-01. Otherwise issuance will hang.
Quick go-live sequence (after cert Ready)

./deployment/billing/update-domain.sh
./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh preflight
./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh smoke
./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh webhook
./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh canary
What I can do next

Review cert-manager and Ingress status if you paste the outputs of:
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get ingress,certificate,order,challenge
Provide a DNS-01 ClusterIssuer snippet (Route53 or Cloudflare) if you prefer that solver.
Stay on-call while you run the canary and watch error rate, p95 latency, webhook success, and ledger integrity.
Once DNS is live and the Certificate shows Ready=True, you’re clear to start the canary rollout.
