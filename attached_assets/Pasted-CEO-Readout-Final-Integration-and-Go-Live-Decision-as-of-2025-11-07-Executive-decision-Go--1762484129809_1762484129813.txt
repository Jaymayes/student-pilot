CEO Readout — Final Integration and Go-Live Decision (as of 2025-11-07)

Executive decision

Go for non-auth surfaces: GO (continue compounding traffic and lead capture).
Logged-in flows: GO if auth clears by 05:00 UTC; otherwise YELLOW slip to Nov 10 for logged-in features while non-auth continues.
Primary objective preserved: Nov 12 ARR ignition on track via Auto Page Maker compounding and stable core API.
P0 blockers to clear before 05:00 UTC

provider_register invalid_client
Root cause: OAuth client not registered in scholar_auth’s client registry.
Owner: Auth DRI + provider_register DRI.
Actions (must complete by 04:30–05:00 UTC):
Register OAuth client provider-register with correct redirect URIs and scopes.
Verify with a live PKCE S256 authorization, confirm token issuance (no invalid_client).
Post evidence (request_id traces and screenshot of successful code→token exchange).
If not cleared by 05:00 UTC: Logged-in GO/NO-GO will slip to Nov 10 (non-auth remains GO).
2. scholarship_sage M2M secret missing in environment

Root cause: Rotated secret not present at runtime.
Owner: Auth DRI + scholarship_sage DRI.
Actions (start immediately; confirm within 30 minutes of secret load):
Load rotated M2M secret to environment; restart app.
Acquire M2M token successfully; start 48h baseline within minutes of success.
Post baseline start timestamp and health confirmation.
Baseline evidence due: Nov 8, 16:00 UTC (baseline_metrics_evidence.md).
Immediate security directive (mandatory)

Secrets were posted in clear text in comms. Treat as compromised.
Owners: Auth DRI + all app DRIs.
Actions (start now; finish within 30 minutes):
Rotate all secrets exposed in chat/war-room artifacts (student_pilot, provider_register, scholarship_sage M2M).
Enforce distribution via secure secret manager only; purge secrets from docs/chat.
Post rotation confirmation and hash-only fingerprints; update redirect URI allowlists if changed.
App-by-app status and orders

scholar_auth — https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GREEN contingent on actual client registration and PKCE verification.
Orders: Register provider_register client; re-verify PKCE S256 for student_pilot; confirm M2M for scholarship_sage; rotate exposed secrets; keep P95 ≤120ms and 99.9% uptime.
scholarship_api — https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GREEN/HOLD; freeze through Nov 12; P95 ~74ms; error 0%; uptime 100%.
Orders: No schema/RBAC/config changes until Nov 12; attach cross-app request_id traces after E2E; remain on-call for ORDER_B and student E2E.
scholarship_agent — https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GREEN (observe-only); P95 ~42ms; uptime 100%.
Orders: Keep auto-apply OFF through Nov 9 ramp; capture cross-app traces post E2E; deliver 24h fairness summary by Nov 10, 12:00 UTC; continue explainability and bias telemetry.
scholarship_sage — https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: YELLOW due to missing M2M env secret; SLOs GREEN otherwise.
Orders: Load M2M secret; start 48h baseline immediately; post evidence; not blocking ARR.
student_pilot — https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: READY pending PKCE confirmation.
Orders: Upon PKCE success, execute 95-step E2E within 30 minutes; post E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md with request_id traces; monitor auth failure rate (target 0%); confirm P95 ≤120ms; cross-browser pass.
provider_register — https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: READY but blocked by invalid_client.
Orders: Execute ORDER_B within 30 minutes of auth green; post ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md; ensure form validation (client + server) and CRUD to scholarship_api; confirm dashboard access; monitor error <0.1%, P95 ≤120ms.
auto_page_maker — https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GREEN (non-auth live); 2,101 pages live; IndexNow ≥95%; CWV p75 GREEN; P95 ~100ms; error 0%; uptime 100%.
Orders: Continue compounding; no unapproved changes pre–Nov 12; ensure graceful degradation to lead capture when auth blocked; daily index coverage and CWV rollups to CEO.
auto_com_center — https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GREEN for fallback; compliance and metrics endpoints active.
Orders: Maintain auto-activation fallback plan for Nov 9, 12:00 UTC if DNS/SQS not GREEN by Nov 8, 16:00 UTC; keep deliverability monitoring and suppression lists active; post hourly health to war-room until Nov 10.
06:00 UTC checkpoint — acceptance criteria

Auth: 0% invalid_client; PKCE S256 verified for student_pilot and provider_register; M2M token verified for scholarship_sage.
Performance: P95 ≤120ms across auth/API critical paths; error rate <0.1%; uptime ≥99.9%.
Evidence posted:
student_pilot: E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md
provider_register: ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md
scholarship_api: ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md (with cross-app traces)
scholarship_sage: baseline start timestamp; baseline_metrics_evidence.md timer started
auto_com_center: metrics and health endpoints screenshots/links
Cross-app request_id traces included for each flow.
ARR and KPI alignment

Near-term ARR protection: Auto Page Maker continues to compound low-CAC traffic regardless of auth timeline; non-auth funnels stay GO.
Nov 12 ARR ignition: Still on track assuming auth clears by Nov 10 at the latest.
KPIs to post at 06:00 UTC:
B2C: First Document Upload activation rate; free→paid signal rate; auth failure rate (target 0%).
B2B: Providers onboarded; scholarship listings created; 3% fee readiness confirmation.
Platform SLOs: P95 ≤120ms; error <0.1%; uptime ≥99.9%.
War-room priorities (now until 05:00 UTC)

Register provider_register OAuth client and complete PKCE verification (Auth DRI). Post proof.
Load scholarship_sage M2M secret, get token, start baseline (Auth + Sage DRIs). Post timestamp and proof.
Immediately rotate any secrets posted in cleartext; switch to secure secret manager distribution. Post rotation confirmation.
On auth green, trigger student_pilot 95-step E2E and provider_register ORDER_B in parallel. Post evidence packages.
Final note

Student value drives revenue: keep non-auth acquisition compounding and ensure logged-in experiences become frictionless as auth clears.
Act with urgency: If auth is not truly GREEN by 05:00 UTC, we will call YELLOW for logged-in at 06:00 UTC and slip to Nov 10, while preserving non-auth growth and Nov 12 ARR.
Report back cadence

Post updates to the war-room every 15 minutes until 05:00 UTC, then at 06:00 UTC with GO/NO-GO call.
All app reports must begin with Application Name and APP_BASE_URL and include evidence links and request_id traces.
