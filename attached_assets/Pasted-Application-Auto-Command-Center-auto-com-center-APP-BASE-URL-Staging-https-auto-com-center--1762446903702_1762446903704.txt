CEO Executive Response – Final Integration and Go-Live Readiness Assessment

Decision

Staging: GO (execute full 8-app chain validation as ordered)
Production: LOCKED; next go/no-go Nov 8, 18:30 UTC; 1% controlled ramp Nov 9 if all gates are green
ARR Ignition: Nov 12 remains approved
Readiness Summary (auto_com_center)

Code/Workflow: 100% complete; pipelines running; monitoring active
Health: 7/7 apps reachable; staging email-only via Postmark; SMS deferred to Nov 11 EOD
Observability: Prometheus and Sentry enabled; request_id propagation to be proven via cross-app traces in validation window
Compliance posture: CAN-SPAM/TCPA/FERPA/COPPA controls configured; will provide evidence package today
Outstanding Pre-Validation Gates (time-bound)

16:00 UTC: Secrets delivery (Postmark, Sentry, AWS SQS/DLQ) – Awaiting; auto-escalate at 16:01 if any missing
17:00 UTC: SPF/DKIM/DMARC green for mail.scholaraiadvisor.com – Hold outbound if not green at 17:01
21:00 UTC: STAGING_VALIDATION.md due (see template below)
21:15 UTC: Chain-wide roll-up with explicit GO/NO-GO for Nov 9 ramp
Integration Status (cross-app)

Event triggers: scholarship_agent (match found), student_pilot (reminders), scholarship_api (event fan-out) – all wired to auto_com_center; validation to capture Sentry trace URLs for request_id correlation
Delivery channels in scope today: Email via Postmark (production-like in staging); in-app notifications OK; SMS out of scope until Nov 11
Third-Party Systems (status and blockers)

Postmark (Email): Staging-ready; awaiting API key delivery at 16:00 UTC; deliverability validation dependent on SPF/DKIM/DMARC
DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC): Must be “green” by 17:00 UTC; block outbound if not
AWS SQS/DLQ: Staging queue/DLQ provisioned; require IAM/secret at 16:00 UTC to finalize; DLQ must remain 0 during validation
Sentry: DSNs pending in secrets package; required for cross-app correlation evidence
Prometheus/Grafana: Active; will export 15- and 60-minute panels for P95 ≤120ms, error <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9%
Twilio: Deferred (SMS) to Nov 11 EOD
SLO and Test Plan (must-pass)

E2E latency: P95 ≤120ms across send→provider acknowledgment path (15- and 60-min windows)
Reliability: Error rate <0.1%; uptime ≥99.9% for the validation window
Deliverability: SPF/DKIM/DMARC green; unsubscribe completes in <5s at 100 concurrent; DLQ=0 with bounce/retry within thresholds
Tracing: At least one Sentry trace URL demonstrating auth→API→UX→comms request_id continuity
Compliance Evidence (to include today)

CAN-SPAM: Valid headers, unsubscribe link, physical address, one-click list-unsubscribe header
TCPA: SMS deferred; document opt-in pipeline and gating plan
FERPA/COPPA: Age gating, consent logs, suppression and audit trails
Fairness/Explainability (communications context): No black-box decisions; retain event rationale in metadata where relevant
If 100% readiness is not possible today

Estimated Go-Live (staging evidence complete): 21:00 UTC today (on track, conditional on secrets/DNS)
Production unlock candidate: Nov 9 (1% ramp) contingent on gates; next formal go/no-go Nov 8, 18:30 UTC
ARR Ignition contribution: Nov 12 (email-only communications path ready to support B2C activation and B2B conversion milestones)
Blockers to call out if missed:
Secrets not delivered by 16:00 UTC (Postmark/SQS/Sentry) – Escalate at 16:01 and re-ETA within 15 minutes
DNS not green by 17:00 UTC – Hold all outbound; run dry-run validations; provide remediation plan and updated ETA
Deliverable – STAGING_VALIDATION.md (due 21:00 UTC)

Production Unlock Gates (Nov 9, 1% ramp) – auto_com_center contribution

Green criteria required:

SLOs over 24h: P95 ≤120ms, uptime ≥99.9%, error <0.1%
Email deliverability: SPF/DKIM/DMARC green; unsubscribe <5s at 100 concurrent; DLQ=0
Compliance package approved; fairness/explainability telemetry active where applicable
Execution Orders (Agent3)

Now–16:00 UTC:
Verify test harness ready for unsubscribe load (100 concurrent) and queue instrumentation
Prep dashboards (Grafana bookmarks) for 15-/60-min captures
16:00–17:00 UTC:
Consume secrets; validate Postmark/SQS/Sentry connectivity
Run DNS checks; if any record red, open incident and pause outbound
17:00–20:30 UTC:
Execute email-only validation suite
Capture unsubscribe load test and DLQ health; confirm deliverability and retries
Execute at least one cross-app E2E to produce Sentry trace link (auth→API→UX→comms)
By 21:00 UTC:
Publish STAGING_VALIDATION.md with all eight evidence points
21:15 UTC Chain Roll-Up:
Provide explicit GO/NO-GO for Nov 9 1% ramp, including:
Secrets status, DNS status
E2E and SLO results
Residual risks to Nov 12 ARR ignition
KPIs and Strategic Alignment

Platform SLOs: P95 ≤120ms, error <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9%
Deliverability: ≥98% for verified domains; unsubscribe <5s (100 concurrent)
Growth engine support:
B2C: Enable First Document Upload activation emails/reminders
B2B: Provider→first applicant notifications to validate 3% platform-fee pathway
CAC discipline: Email/in-app only; no paid acquisition dependencies
Risk and Mitigation

Risk: Secrets delay → Mitigation: 16:01 auto-escalation; partial dry-runs; re-ETA within 15 minutes
Risk: DNS records not green → Mitigation: Hold outbound; run staging dry-run; expedite DNS; re-ETA
Risk: DLQ growth → Mitigation: Backoff tuning; circuit breaker; alert at threshold and publish root-cause
Risk: P95 drift >120ms → Mitigation: Disable non-critical hooks; scale workers; retry tuning
CEO Directive

Proceed exactly as scheduled. No production actions until gates evidenced.
Evidence-first discipline is mandatory. No assertions without artifacts.
Deliver STAGING_VALIDATION.md by 21:00 UTC and participate in the chain roll-up at 21:15 UTC with a clear GO/NO-GO for the Nov 9 1% ramp.
Preserve Nov 12 ARR ignition by prioritizing deliverability, observability, and compliance gates today.
I will be on-call for the 21:15 UTC roll-up to make the final recommendation for Nov 9’s controlled ramp based on the evidence you submit.
