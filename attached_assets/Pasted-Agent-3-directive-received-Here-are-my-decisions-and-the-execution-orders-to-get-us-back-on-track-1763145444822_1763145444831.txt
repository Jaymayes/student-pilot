Agent 3 — directive received. Here are my decisions and the execution orders to get us back on track and protect Dec 1 ARR ignition.

Executive decisions

Access resolution (now): Option A approved. Ops must grant Agent3 edit access to these five workspaces within 30 minutes:
scholar_auth
scholarship_api
auto_com_center
student_pilot
provider_register
If access is not confirmed by T+30 minutes, Platform Lead executes the mirroring procedure you prepared and invites Agent3 immediately after creation. No third delay.

Parallel progress (start immediately): Proceed with SendGrid/Twilio integration in auto_com_center now. Do not wait for access resolution.

Path B is authorized: Execute the 8-hour sprint the moment access is granted. Hourly CEO updates required. Use RED/AMBER/GREEN and “evidence links + commit IDs” in each update.

Budget authorization (cap/guardrails):

ESP (SendGrid/Postmark/Mailgun): up to $1,500 MRR initial cap
SMS (Twilio): up to $1,000 MRR initial cap
Replit Reserved VMs and Autoscale: up to $1,500 MRR initial cap
Redis/connection pooling add-on: up to $500 MRR
Monitoring/alerting (Sentry/Logtail or equivalent): up to $500 MRR
k6 cloud or equivalent load test credits: up to $500 one-time this sprint Any variance above caps requires my sign-off.
5. Compliance and Responsible AI: Enforce FERPA/COPPA alignment, privacy-by-design, and zero tolerance for academic dishonesty enablement. All AI features must be explainable, with bias checks documented. Security risk acceptance requires my approval.

8-hour execution plan and acceptance criteria
Gate 0 must be closed today: Security, CORS, config, and M2M auth. Gate 1 integration begins immediately after.

T+0 to T+2 — scholar_auth (blocker-breaker)

Requirements:
RS256 JWTs with /.well-known/jwks.json; key rotation SOP in repo
Roles/scopes finalized: student, provider, admin (+ provider_admin if used)
OAuth2 client_credentials for M2M; refresh + revocation strategy
MFA enforced for admin/provider_admin (email/SMS OTP acceptable)
Strict CORS (exact origin allowlist), rate limits, audit logs
Health/readiness endpoints; error budget SLO hooks
Evidence:
Live JWKS; signed JWT validation from scholarship_api; audit log scrubs; Postman collection; OpenAPI doc exposed for auth endpoints
T+2 to T+4 — scholarship_api (security + reliability)

Requirements:
JWT validation middleware (sig + exp + nbf + role/claims checks)
CORS allowlist: student_pilot and provider_register only
OpenAPI spec live; 401/403 paths standardized
Triggers: webhooks or internal calls to auto_com_center; data feed to auto_page_maker defined
Connection pooling tuned; Redis caching for hot reads
Health/ready endpoints; request timeout middleware; circuit breaker on upstreams
Evidence:
Passing k6 smoke: 100 RPS, P95 < 300ms, error rate < 1%
Sample end-to-end: student creates session → secure API hit → notification fired (canary path)
T+4 to T+6 — auto_com_center (notifications)

Requirements:
SendGrid/Twilio integrated with verified domain/sender; bounce/complaint hooks
S2S authorization (client_credentials) enforced
Templates driven by env for deep links back to frontends
Canary notification script (email + SMS) with runbook
Evidence:
Live test notifications to controlled inbox/number; signed request verification logged; webhook receipts stored
T+4 to T+6 (parallel) — Env/config standardization

Requirements:
Eliminate hardcoded URLs; Replit Secrets only
Shared .env schema published; per-service config check script
Evidence:
Config linter passes in all services; secrets checklists committed
T+6 to T+8 — Frontend wiring and E2E smoke

student_pilot:
Login/registration via scholar_auth; secure JWT storage; attach Authorization header
GA4 “first_document_upload” event wired
Standardized error handling for 401/403/5xx
provider_register:
Provider auth; scholarship CRUD; attach JWT to API calls
GA4 “first_scholarship_created” event wired
Evidence:
E2E happy-paths pass: Student journey (register → login → view scholarships → upload doc) and Provider journey (register → create scholarship → view applicant)
GA4 DebugView screenshots and event payload samples
System-wide Gate 0/1 acceptance criteria

Gate 0 (must pass today before any go-live calls):
Auth: RS256 JWTs, RBAC, MFA, M2M tokens functional; strict CORS; audit logs enabled
Config: No hardcoded URLs; all secrets via env; health/ready endpoints live
Security smoke: OWASP top issues mitigated at middleware level; rate limiting on public endpoints
Gate 1 (start immediately after Gate 0):
Notifications: auto_com_center receives and delivers canary emails/SMS from scholarship_api
API docs: OpenAPI visible for scholar_auth and scholarship_api
E2E: Student and Provider happy-paths pass in staging
KPIs and reporting cadence

Daily (until Dec 1):
B2C activation: first_document_upload count, conversion from auth→upload
B2B activation: first_scholarship_created count, time-to-first-listing
Uptime P99.9; P95 latency target ~120ms on core read endpoints; error rate < 1%
Hourly (during sprint):
Status by service (R/A/G), last-commit IDs, evidence links, and blocker log
ARR ignition readiness (Dec 1)

B2C revenue path must be live by Dec 1:
Student credit purchase flow via Stripe Checkout in student_pilot (minimal viable: single “credits” SKU, receipt webhook to scholarship_api)
Analytics tracking for checkout_start and checkout_success
B2B provider fee (3%) can trail by one week if needed:
Stripe Connect onboarding for providers, KYC, fee configuration, payout schedule
If risk/timeline conflicts arise, we launch B2C first on Dec 1 and enable B2B fee by Dec 8
Risk controls and escalation

If access isn’t granted by T+30: Platform Lead executes mirroring immediately; Agent3 proceeds in mirrored workspaces.
Any P0 security regression (auth/CORS) halts deploys until resolved.
Any service missing Gate 0 by end of sprint gets quarantined behind feature flags; other services continue.
What I need from you now

Confirm access grant completion within 30 minutes (Ops to post confirmation plus workspace URLs).
Agent3: begin SendGrid/Twilio integration in auto_com_center immediately and post first canary results within the hour.
Post hourly updates with: R/A/G, commit IDs, evidence links/screens, and any deviations from acceptance criteria.
You have clear authority, budget, and acceptance criteria. Execute with urgency. My expectation is Gate 0 closure today, integration canaries firing, and E2E happy-paths passing in staging by end of sprint.
