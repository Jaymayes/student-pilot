Executive acknowledgement from the CEO of Scholar AI Advisor

I’ve reviewed your full DRI updates across the portfolio. Decisions below are final for today’s windows and aligned to our Prime Directive and growth model.

Portfolio decisions and directives

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: GO-LIVE READY. Gate A deliverability certification authorized for 20:00–20:15 UTC. Maintain multi-ESP failover and request_id lineage. Publish post-run evidence to scholarship_sage immediately after the window.
KPIs to hit tonight: inbox placement ≥99%, P95 ≤120 ms, <0.1% failures. Observer dashboards in scholarship_sage must ingest rate-limit telemetry by EOD+1. This aligns with our autonomous ops and HOTL guardrails for explainability and auditability .
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: NO-GO until Gate C passes at P95 ≤120 ms. Run the 20:00–20:15 UTC load test and post evidence.
Immediate focus: Fix the 18 diagnostics in server/routes.ts before load testing; verify MFA/SSO, RBAC, token/session hygiene. Add a WebAuthn/FIDO2 roadmap artifact (passwordless option) to evidence, consistent with our identity posture .
Risk note: Auth is our portfolio’s single hard blocker for GA on dependent apps; treat this as Priority 1 from now until Gate C pass.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: GO-LIVE READY. Post-freeze canary at 20:00 UTC, then phased rollout if canary remains GREEN. Enforce ≤5-minute rollback.
Guardrail: Our zero-CAC SEO engine is the B2C top-of-funnel; preserve CWV p75 GREEN and daily rollups to scholarship_sage. This is central to the SEO-led acquisition plan in our Playbook and the “First Document Upload” activation path to ARR .
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: CONDITIONAL GO for limited beta after Gate B PASS at 18:00–18:15 UTC; NO-GO for GA until Gate C (auth) passes.
Gate B tonight: Prove webhook signature verification, deterministic 3% fee, refund scenarios, finance sign-off; post evidence by 18:15 UTC.
Compliance: Maintain KYB/KYC artifacts and immutable audit trails; aligns with our autonomous API governance posture and auditability expectations .
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: DELAYED to Nov 13, 16:00 UTC.
Immediate directive: Yes—proceed now with COPPA age gate behind a feature flag, plus DSAR endpoints joint session at 21:00–22:00 UTC. Publish updated ToS/Privacy upon Legal sign-off prior to enabling. Defer outbound email until Gate A PASS; use in-app notifications.
Strategic tie-in: Drive users to “First Document Upload” as the activation North Star feeding B2C credits revenue per the Playbook .
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: CONDITIONAL GO for Nov 13, 16:00 UTC.
Tonight: Implement DSAR endpoints post-freeze; publish WAF/DoS thresholds and per-tenant rate limits; keep P95 well under 120 ms with JWT via JWKS. Evidence discipline is mandatory.
ARR linkage: This API underpins credits monetization and provider fee integrity; ensure rate-limit/circuit-breaker runbooks are published, consistent with autonomous self-protection and optimization patterns .
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: GO (Observer Mode).
Due EOD+1: Rate-limit/abuse dashboards using auto_com_center telemetry. By Nov 13–14: CAC and provider revenue tiles. This supports KPI visibility for the SEO flywheel and B2B platform fees, as laid out in the Playbook’s KPI and ARR roadmap .
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: GO (Observer Mode) and CONDITIONAL GO for campaign sends pending P95 ≤120 ms and deliverability warm-up completion.
Requirements to unlock sends: Latency reduction within 48 hours, consent workflow end-to-end checks, and 14–21 day warm-up. Maintain fairness telemetry and HOTL approvals to meet our Responsible AI standard for transparency and bias mitigation .
Immediate priorities for Agent3 (in order)

scholar_auth Gate C readiness
Fix server diagnostics, verify MFA/SSO, RBAC, and rerun perf harness. Gate C is the critical path for GA across apps. Use passwordless readiness as a secondary win if cycles allow .
2. provider_register Gate B execution at 18:00–18:15 UTC

Complete webhook, fee/refund tests, finance sign-off, and evidence publication. This unblocks limited beta and positions B2B revenue ramp per our roadmap .
3. auto_com_center Gate A at 20:00–20:15 UTC

Confirm DKIM at 14:00 UTC; execute canary; publish deliverability evidence to scholarship_sage. Maintain self-protecting failovers and circuit breakers per our autonomous ops playbook .
4. DSAR joint session (scholarship_api + student_pilot + scholar_auth) at 21:00–22:00 UTC

Implement access/export/delete/status endpoints with 30-day fulfillment workflow, audit trails, and clear documentation; ethics and explainability are non-negotiable .
5. student_pilot COPPA age gate

Implement and ship behind a flag tonight; enable once Legal signs off on ToS/Privacy.
KPI guardrails and evidence discipline

SLOs: Maintain ≥99.9% uptime, P95 ≤120 ms, error rate ≤0.1% across all apps. These are table stakes for scale and trust as we evolve toward autonomous, self-healing and self-protecting services .
Evidence: Keep /api/evidence current with SHA-256 checksums per app. Observer-mode dashboards in scholarship_sage must roll up cross-app metrics daily at 06:00 UTC.
Growth engine: Protect the SEO flywheel (auto_page_maker). Zero-CAC acquisition is the primary driver to $10M ARR; do not ship changes that threaten CWV p75 GREEN or indexation .
Responsible AI: Continue HOTL approval gates, rationale coverage, and fairness monitoring to avoid black-box decisions and mitigate bias across autonomous components .
Answers to your explicit asks

“Should I proceed immediately with Age Gate implementation while awaiting the DSAR joint session?” Yes. Implement now behind a feature flag; enable after Legal sign-off and post DSAR session validation. Publish evidence to student_pilot’s index before the Nov 13, 16:00 UTC decision.
Final notes

Capital allocation is tied to organic growth performance. The Auto Page Maker engine and the “First Document Upload” activation metric remain our priority levers for near-term B2C revenue and long-term LTV expansion .
Maintain a lean, autonomous operation. Let the systems execute; escalate only on exceptions that threaten SLOs, compliance, or the SEO flywheel.
Proceed as directed. I’ll expect Gate B, Gate A, and Gate C evidence posted within each window and a consolidated update in scholarship_sage by 23:00 UTC.
