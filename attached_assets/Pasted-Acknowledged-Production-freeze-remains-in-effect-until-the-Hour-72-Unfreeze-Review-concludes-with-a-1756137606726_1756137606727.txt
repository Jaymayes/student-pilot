Acknowledged. Production freeze remains in effect until the Hour 72 Unfreeze Review concludes with all must-pass criteria met.

Final executive instructions and schedule

Unfreeze Review logistics

Timebox: 30 minutes at Hour 72
Required attendees: Backend Lead, Frontend Lead, DevOps Lead, QA/Sec Lead, Data Lead
Agenda (strict):
0–5 min: QA/Sec — verification summary (qa-comprehensive-execution-report rerun, deltas, 0 Critical/High, secret scans clean)
5–12 min: Backend/Frontend — demos of access control, SSR fix, SQLi hardening, error handling; confirm no PII in logs
12–18 min: DevOps/Data — dashboards live (auth abuse, reconciliation, endpoint health, p95/5xx, error budget), Redis limiter metrics, canary guardrails
18–22 min: Billing/Finance — reconciliation report ($0 deltas), idempotency checks
22–28 min: Residual risk brief (top 3 risks + mitigations, owners, monitoring)
28–30 min: CEO go/no-go decision
Pre-reads due 2 hours before the review

QA: Full verification report and delta summary; canary validation checklist
DevOps: CI gate screenshots/logs (eval ban, SQL concat ban, secret scans passing), rate-limiter config and metrics
Backend/Frontend: Test IDs and logs for auth gating, SSR 200/404, parameterized queries, fault-injection results
Billing: 24h reconciliation output showing $0 deltas; idempotency evidence
Data: Live dashboard links (security & reliability board)
Operational guardrails and on-call

On-call roster: Confirm primary/secondary for Backend, DevOps, DB, Security for the 8-hour post-unfreeze window
War room: Open 30 minutes pre-review; stay live through ramp-up
Rollback: One-click rollback verified; auto-rollback on p95 +15% or 5xx +0.5% vs baseline; freeze re-applies on any PII redaction violation
Go/No-Go matrix (unchanged)

Must-pass: 0 Critical/High; secret scans clean (repo + built assets); correct access control/public status codes; SQLi tests blocked + SAST clean; SLOs stable (99.9% uptime, p95 within ±15%)
Automatic no-go: Any unresolved secret, auth bypass, reconciliation deltas > $0, or guardrail breach without immediate root cause and rollback
Conditional go requires CEO approval: Only minor rate-limit FP 0.5–1.0% with mitigation plan within 24h
Post-unfreeze rollout plan

Traffic ramp: 10% for 2 hours → 50% for 4 hours → 100% if guardrails green
Communications kit (prep now; send after green light):
Internal release notes summarizing security hardening
Status page update template
Partner/stakeholder note affirming strengthened controls (no technical details, just assurance)
Immediate next deployments (pending green light):
Growth Sprint code behind flags: pricing/onboarding experiments, entitlement checks, provider portal MVP slices
SEO instrumentation and CWV beacons (guarded rollout)
Parallel work allowed during freeze (no prod deploys)

Content/SEO page generation and sitemap prep
Provider outreach/LOIs and sandbox demos
Experiment design and analytics event taxonomy finalization
Dashboard integration for QA artifacts
Escalation

If any must-pass item is at risk by Hour 60, escalate in the exec channel with options and impact. Do not wait for the review.
Proceed. Quality over speed remains the rule until we clear the bar and safely resume growth deployments.
