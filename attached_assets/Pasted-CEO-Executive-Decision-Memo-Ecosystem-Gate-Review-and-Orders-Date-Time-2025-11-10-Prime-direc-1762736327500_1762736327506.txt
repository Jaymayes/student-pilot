CEO Executive Decision Memo — Ecosystem Gate Review and Orders
Date/Time: 2025-11-10

Prime directive alignment

We protect the SEO flywheel, ship with evidence, and unlock both funnels with the lowest CAC. No paid acquisition until deliverability is GREEN and payments are PASS. Every call below is tied to ARR ignition.
Executive calls (by application)

auto_page_maker — GO-LIVE READY, FROZEN (affirmed)
• Decision: Maintain freeze through Nov 12. Daily KPI rollups continue. This remains the primary organic engine.

scholarship_agent — GO-LIVE READY, FROZEN (observer)
• Decision: Maintain freeze. Keep fairness telemetry on schedule.

scholarship_sage — GO-LIVE READY, FROZEN (observer)
• Decision: Maintain freeze. HOTL gates enforced.

student_pilot — DELAYED; conditional launch
• CEO call: Conditional GO for Nov 11, 16:00 UTC only if all gates are GREEN:

Pre-soak PASS with T+30 evidence posted,
Deliverability GREEN (auto_com_center),
Stripe PASS (Finance). • If any gate is RED/late, slip to Nov 12, 16:00 UTC. No exceptions.
provider_register — DELAYED; waitlist mode
• CEO call: Earliest GO Nov 12, 16:00 UTC with same gates as student_pilot. Keep waitlist mode ON until GREEN across gates.

scholarship_api — DELAYED; pre-soak participant
• CEO call: Proceed; must meet SLOs and provide 10+ request_id lineage traces in the student_pilot T+30 bundle. No-PII logging proof is mandatory.

scholar_auth — DELAYED; P1 incident (JWKS 404)
• CEO call: P1 fix now. Resolve JWKS within a 2-hour SLA.

Step 1: Immediate rollback to last known-good artifact that served /.well-known/openid-configuration and jwks_uri.
Step 2: If rollback fails, publish the current public JWK set from KMS to a static /oidc/jwks endpoint behind CDN; rotate signing keys; invalidate caches; retest OIDC end-to-end.
Step 3: Reinstate PKCE S256 enforcement and immediate token revocation tests, include proofs in T+30. • Pre-soak/launch are blocked if JWKS remains down. Treat as blocker for the entire ecosystem.
auto_com_center — DELAYED; deliverability gate
• CEO call: T0 must fire upon Postmark “Verified” + DNS live. Certify by T0+90 with ≥90% inbox, ≤10% Promotions, <0.3% bounces, zero blocklists.
• If Gmail Promotions >10%, run subject/body/header adjustments and re-test within the same window. No production send volume until GREEN.

Mandatory evidence and deadlines

Pre-soak window: As scheduled. All participants must meet SLOs (≥99.9% uptime, ≤120ms P95 service, ≤200ms P95 E2E, ≤0.1% errors).
T+30 evidence bundle: Post within the hard 21:30–22:00 UTC window for each participant. • Required in bundle: P50/P95 histograms (service + E2E), uptime, error tallies, 10+ request_id lineage traces (scholar_auth → scholarship_api → app), PKCE S256 enforcement proof, immediate token revocation proof, no-PII logging validation, TLS 1.3 proof, executive PASS/FAIL summary.
Deliverability certification: Post GREEN/RED call link within 15 minutes of T+90.
Payments: Stripe PASS evidence by Nov 10, 18:00 UTC (Finance). No revenue operations without this.
Owner assignments and escalation

Agent3 (execution owner): • JWKS P1 fix (scholar_auth) under 2-hour SLA; if not green by end of SLA, escalate to CEO with rollback state and temporary static JWKS plan executed. • Pre-soak execution and T+30 evidence posting for student_pilot, provider_register, scholarship_api, scholar_auth. • Deliverability certification for auto_com_center (run T0→T+90 program; post GREEN/RED).
Email Ops + Deputy Ops: • Complete Postmark “Verified”; publish SPF, DKIM (aligned), DMARC p=quarantine with strict alignment (aspf=s, adkim=s); issue T0 signal immediately upon verification.
Finance: • Deliver Stripe PASS proof by Nov 10, 18:00 UTC.
Risk controls and guardrails

Immediate rollback + 60-minute RCA for any guardrail breach. Evidence must remain immutable and reconstructable.
No changes to auto_page_maker, scholarship_agent, scholarship_sage through Nov 12 (freeze holds).
No paid acquisition until Deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS + CEO GREEN for revenue flows.
ARR ignition checkpoints

B2C (student_pilot): Credits at 4x AI markup. Target activation: first document upload and first successful match. Launch only on all-gates-GREEN.
B2B (provider_register): 3% platform fee; enable only after deliverability + payments + security evidence are GREEN and lineage proofs posted.
What I need back

A single link to the T+30 evidence bundle by the end of the window.
A single link to the Deliverability GREEN/RED call within 15 minutes of T+90.
Confirmation (or exception) on Stripe PASS by Finance deadline.
Act with urgency. Ship with proof. Protect the flywheel. Unlock ARR only when the gates are GREEN.
