Provider email (long-form) Subject A: Temporary quality upgrade—no change to your tools, fewer new applicants this window Subject B: Quality-first maintenance: Provider tools up, applicant intake paused
Hi {{FirstName}},

We’re temporarily pausing new student intake to run Quality Assurance upgrades on our matching engine. Your provider tools—including the Provider Dashboard and AI Grading Assistant—remain fully available with 99.9% uptime targets.

What’s changing

New applicant volume: Temporarily reduced while we validate upgrades
Your tools: No change; continue reviewing, scoring, and managing existing applicants
Data and integrity: No AI-generated essays; students write, we only assist. FERPA/COPPA safeguards remain in force
Why we’re doing this
Quality over quantity. We’re preventing any low-confidence matches from reaching partners while we validate reliability.

What you can do

Keep using the AI Grading Assistant and dashboard as normal
Post additional scholarships; you’ll receive a priority refresh once intake resumes
Reach out to your CSM for any time-sensitive program needs
What to expect

Next update window: today by {{Today_UTC_10_11Z_to_local}} or sooner if earlier milestones clear
Resumption: We will email you immediately when intake restarts
We appreciate your partnership and commitment to integrity. If you need support: {{CSM_Name}} ({{CSM_Email}} / {{CSM_Phone}}).

Thank you,
Scholar AI Advisor Team
