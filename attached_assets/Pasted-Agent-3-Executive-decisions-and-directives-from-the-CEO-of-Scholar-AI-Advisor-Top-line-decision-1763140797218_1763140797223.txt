Agent 3 — Executive decisions and directives from the CEO of Scholar AI Advisor

Top-line decision

Path A is approved and mandated: Ops must grant you access to scholar_auth, scholarship_api, and auto_com_center within 15 minutes of this notice. If access is not confirmed at T+15, you are authorized to execute Path B (mirror under CEO org) immediately at T+16 with DNS cutover upon evidence passing Gate 0.
Proceed now with auto_com_center Gate 1 hardening while the access clock runs. This aligns with our security-first posture and reduces downstream integration risk across services .
Why this call

Our critical blockers—centralized auth, CORS, config standardization, S2S auth, and unstarted E2E tests—are systemic and must be resolved before Go-Live. Industry guidance for agent-built microservices emphasizes architected security, resiliency patterns, and disciplined integration over ad-hoc builds, and explicitly calls out the architect-led role and strict secrets management to de-risk agent velocity .
Gate 0 must bake in resilience: retries with backoff, circuit breakers, readiness health checks, and automated recovery, so we can hit our SLOs and avoid cascading failures under load .
Immediate orders (effective now)

Ops: Grant Agent 3 contributor access to the three workspaces (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center) within 15 minutes. If not possible, confirm “No-Access” and stand by for DNS cutover post-mirroring. Note: Replit’s publish/snapshot model means we will deliberately snapshot each Gate 0 pass; no hot-fixes to live instances outside republish cycles .
Agent 3 (while the T+15 timer runs):
auto_com_center: implement env-driven templates, strict allowlist CORS, S2S auth scaffolding, and ESP/SMS connector prep; begin bounces/complaints monitoring setup (evidence required).
student_pilot and provider_register: wire GA4 “First Document Upload” activation event now. This is our B2C activation lever tied to student value creation and downstream monetization; our Playbook prioritizes Document Hub-led activation as an adoption driver .
Gate 0 criteria (non-negotiable acceptance bars)

scholar_auth
RS256 JWTs via JWKS; 300s TTL; rotation SOP documented.
RBAC claims for student, provider, admin (+ scopes) enforced.
OAuth2 client_credentials for all internal services; no hardcoded secrets; Replit Secrets only.
Strict CORS allowlist (exact-origin match).
MFA enforced for privileged roles.
Evidence: jwks.json, sample short-lived tokens, RBAC matrix, MFA enforcement proof, CORS test logs.
Rationale: secure-by-default, secrets hygiene, and architected auth are mandatory for autonomous app ecosystems .
scholarship_api
JWT signature + claims validation; role/route authorization.
Readiness probe (/readyz) that checks DB/Redis/JWKS; retries with backoff and circuit breakers on upstream dependencies, to contain fault cascades .
Connection pooling tuned; Reserved VM/Autoscale prepared for load.
Performance: sustained 250–300 RPS, P95 ≤ 120ms, error rate ≤ 0.5%.
Evidence: k6 run ID and report, /readyz snapshots, config diffs.
auto_com_center
SendGrid + Twilio integrated; domain authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) verified.
S2S auth only; exact-origin CORS; env-based link generation back to frontends.
Canary: 250 RPS for 30 minutes, errors ≤ 0.5%.
Evidence: provider verification screenshots, canary run ID, bounce/complaint monitoring proof.
Cross-platform hardening mandates (apply to all services)

Config standardization: eliminate hardcoded URLs and credentials; single .env schema and secrets via Replit Secrets across apps .
CORS: explicit allowlist for student_pilot and provider_register only; no wildcards.
S2S auth: OAuth2 client_credentials with short-lived tokens; JWKS caching; clock-skew tolerance; audit logs.
Resilience patterns: retries with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, bulkheads for pools, and health/readiness endpoints in every service .
Testing: adopt the layered testing hierarchy and CI/CD-based continuous testing; integration then E2E must validate the core Student and Provider journeys before launch .
Execution timeline (timeboxed)

T+00: Access clock starts (15 minutes). Agent 3 proceeds with auto_com_center Gate 1 and student_pilot/provider_register analytics wiring.
T+15:
If access granted (Path A): 8-hour sequence begins immediately: Hour 0–2 scholar_auth; Hour 2–4 scholarship_api; Hour 4–6 auto_com_center; Hour 6–8 performance re-test + evidence packaging.
If access denied (Path B): Mirror three workspaces under CEO org and execute the same 8-hour runbooks; prepare DNS cutover upon evidence pass. Note: vendor/platform limits and performance variability on Replit require disciplined resilience and may justify targeted off-platform augmentation for hot paths if we cannot meet SLOs under load .
Nov 15, 10:30 AM MST: CEO Gate 0 Go/No-Go. If GREEN, proceed to Gate 1–2 integration/E2E the same day.
KPIs and ARR alignment

Readiness: Gate 0 pass (Y/N); P95 latency ≤ 120ms at 250–300 RPS; error ≤ 0.5%.
B2C funnel: % of new users reaching First Document Upload; conversion to paid credits; match CTR uplift after Sage integration. Playbook data indicates Document Hub activation is our most reliable engagement lever—optimize around it .
B2B funnel: verified providers, time-to-first-listing, scholarships live.
Ops efficiency: zero hardcoded secrets; CORS violations = 0; incident-free publish cycles consistent with Replit’s snapshot model .
Risk and compliance posture

Responsible AI: bias mitigation, transparency, and appeal channels are strategic advantages and must be operationalized post-Gate 0 with monitoring dashboards and periodic audits .
Security governance: we will scale agent velocity only with commensurate security controls and automated scanning; otherwise we scale risk faster than output .
Reporting cadence and artifacts

Hourly during Gate 0 execution: RED/AMBER/GREEN per service, k6 run IDs, /readyz snapshots, config diffs.
Evidence packages per service posted at completion of each Gate.
Direct answers to your requests

Yes, proceed with auto_com_center hardening now while the access decision window runs.
Ops must respond within 15 minutes. If access is not granted, you are authorized to execute mirroring immediately and proceed to DNS cutover on Gate 0 evidence pass.
This plan aligns with our Prime Directive: ship a secure, resilient, low-CAC platform that maximizes student value and activates the B2C engine, while readying the B2B revenue lane. Execute with urgency and send the first hourly update as soon as the T+15 outcome is known.
