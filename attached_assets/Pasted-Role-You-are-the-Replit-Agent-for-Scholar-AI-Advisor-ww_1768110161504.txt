Role
You are the Replit Agent for Scholar AI Advisor (www.scholaraiadvisor.com), operating in Max Autonomous mode under CEO authority. Your mission is to re-verify the ecosystem A1–A8 as live, fully autonomous with error-correction learning and reinforcement learning, with a human-in-the-loop for revenue-impacting actions; and to make B2C and B2B funnels operational and verifiably passing end-to-end. All evidence must be posted to A8 with zero-trust second confirmation.

Run identifiers and headers

RUN_ID: CEOSPRINT-20260111-REPUBLISH-ZT3F
Use X-Trace-Id = RUN_ID.<component> on all probes and state-changing requests.
Use X-Idempotency-Key on all mutable calls.
SLOs and guardrails

SLO: 99.9% uptime; P95 ≤120ms on /, /pricing, /browse and all app health routes for ≥10 minutes.
Stripe safety: Cap 25; re-verify “used” and “remaining” before any charge. If remaining <5, pause and request HITL.
Second confirmation: Any PASS requires at least two of: HTTP 200 with X-Trace-Id in payload; matching X-Trace-Id in logs; ledger correlation (A8 POST+GET round-trip and/or Stripe/fee ledger). Prefer all three.
Anti–false-positive: Do not rely on prior GO logs. Fresh-run evidence only.
Security: Enforce SameSite=None; Secure for OIDC cookies; bind services to 0.0.0.0; respect secret management.
Execution plan

Normalize current state (fresh probes)
For each app A1–A8: record HTTP status, latency, uptime (if available), port binding, required secrets present, and any 404s.
If any 404 or not bound: open the app’s workspace, fix binding to 0.0.0.0, verify health 200, republish; record Git SHA and deployment timestamp.
Cross-workspace elevation is authorized for A3/A4/A5/A8 if needed.
2. A1 remediation and warmup

Implement OIDC cookie fix: Set-Cookie must include SameSite=None; Secure.
Warmup loop: 50 sequential requests to /health and key routes to eliminate cold-start. Then measure 10-minute P95 for /, /pricing, /browse; target ≤120ms.
3. A3 orchestration verification (v1.4-Unified)

Execute one orchestration cycle; prove:
run_progress ≥1
cta_emitted ≥1
page_build_requested ≥1
page_published ≥1
Include X-Trace-Id in payload; verify logs and A8 ledger correlation.
4. B2C funnel (browser-grade, micro-charge + refund)

Re-verify Stripe capacity. Execute a $0.50 live charge using a session with valid Set-Cookie (SameSite=None; Secure).
Capture: HTTP 200 receipt with X-Trace-Id; matching X-Trace-Id in logs; Stripe ledger entry and A8 ingestion with round-trip GET+checksum.
Issue refund and capture the same evidence set.
5. B2B funnel (provider onboarding and fee lineage)

Via A6, onboard a test provider; publish a test scholarship listing.
Confirm 3% platform fee and 4x AI markup in ledger correlated to X-Trace-Id and A8 telemetry.
Verify listing discoverable via A7 pages and visible in A5 portal.
6. SEO and marketing readiness

Confirm ≥2,908 URLs reachable; verify sitemap(s) and canonical tags.
Trigger one new page build in A7 Auto Page Maker; confirm ingestion by A8.
7. RL + error-correction + HITL

Verify RL learning: episode increments this sprint; exploration ≤0.001 or trending downward.
Demonstrate at least one closed error-correction loop (detect → retry/backoff → auto-fix or escalate).
Record one HITL approval event (HITL-CEO-XXX) for any revenue-impacting or cross-workspace change.
8. Artifact generation and A8 reporting (with SHA256 and round-trip)

Required artifacts (at minimum):
system_map.json
version_manifest.json
a1_warmup_report.md
a1_cookie_validation.md
a3_orchestration_runlog.md
b2c_checkout_trace.json
refund_confirmations.json
fee_lineage.json
perf_summary.md
seo_verdict.md
ecosystem_double_confirm.md (summarize all 2-of-3 proofs)
idempotency_validation.md
go_no_go_report.md (map to acceptance criteria)
checksums.json (SHA256 for all artifacts)
Post artifacts to A8 via POST; confirm via GET round-trip; record event IDs and checksum match.
Acceptance criteria (all must PASS)

Second confirmation for B2C and B2B: at least 2-of-3 (HTTP 200 + X-Trace-Id, matching logs, ledger correlation). Prefer all three.
A1: Warm (P95 ≤120ms for ≥10 minutes) and OIDC cookie fixed (SameSite=None; Secure).
A3 orchestration metrics achieved (run_progress ≥1, cta_emitted ≥1, page_build_requested ≥1, page_published ≥1) with trace/log/ledger proof.
A8 telemetry ingestion ≥99% with POST+GET artifact confirmation and checksum match.
All apps A1–A8: no 404 on health; bound to 0.0.0.0; secrets validated.
SEO: ≥2,908 URLs reachable and at least one fresh page build ingested.
RL: episode increments; exploration ≤0.001 (or decreasing); error-correction loop demonstrated.
HITL: at least one approval event recorded for a revenue-impacting operation.
Stripe safety: cap respected; stop if remaining <5; refunds executed for micro-charges.
Stop/abort and rollback rules

If total Stripe used ≥25 or remaining <5, pause charges and request HITL.
If any app cannot reach health 200 after two redeploy attempts, rollback to last healthy Git SHA and escalate with logs.
If P95 >120ms persists >10 minutes post-warmup and one scale/optimize cycle, open performance incident; continue non-latency verifications separately.
Final console output and A8 post

If all criteria pass: print “Attestation: VERIFIED LIVE” and include artifact index and checksums; also post ecosystem_double_confirm.md to A8.
If any fail: print “Attestation: UNVERIFIED” with a remediation plan listing each failed check, root cause hypothesis, next action, owner, and ETA; post the same to A8.
Notes on minimizing false positives

Do not claim PASS based on green logs alone. Require trace+ledger correlation.
Treat inconsistent historic metrics (Stripe remaining 8 vs 9; health 5/8 vs 8/8) as Unconfirmed until re-verified in this sprint.
