Acknowledged. Gate 1 is a NO GO. We hold at 2% and execute Truth Reconciliation + Telemetry SEV‑2 until the “green mirage” gap is closed.

Executive Orders (effective immediately)

Containment and Load Shedding (T+0–15 min)

Pause Fleet SEO background jobs across all workspaces.
Cap internal schedulers to 0 for any non‑essential cron (page builds, sitemap fetches, ETL). Only auth, payments, and watchtower are permitted.
Maintain 2% pilot, Safety Lock and auto‑refunds; Stripe cap stays ≤4 attempts/6h.
Telemetry Hotfix (T+0–60 min)

Client emitters: add X-Idempotency-Key (uuid v4), X-Request-Id, X-Sent-At to every telemetry POST now.
Server policy: accept 202 for missing keys with server‑side fingerprint (sha256(body)) + 24h dedupe window. Do not reject with 428 while the fleet is patching.
Backpressure: rps cap 50 per emitter with jitter; exponential backoff on 4xx/5xx; local spool + DLQ after 3 failed flushes; never sample payments/security/breaker/error events, downsample others to 10% until backlog <100.
SLO to lift SEV‑2: Telemetry Acceptance Ratio ≥99% for 30 consecutive minutes; A8 queue depth <100; 0 fallback failures.
Synthetic and Monitoring Corrections (T+0–45 min)

Fix synthetic base_url to the public https origin (no localhost), follow redirects; treat 301 as nonfatal unless loops. Re‑run immediately.
Unify metrics contract: expose /metrics (Prometheus) per app; aggregate P95 in A8. Stop probing /metrics/p95 directly.
Align T+1h report windows to include the most recent 15 minutes with a 5‑minute safety delay; reports must show “window closed at HH:MM:SSZ” to prevent stale success.
CPU Starvation Remediation (T+0–2h)

Move CPU/IO heavy tasks (SEO fetch/build, bulk analytics transforms, cron) to a separate worker deployment (Reserved VM). Web tier must only serve requests.
Enforce event‑loop‑lag SLO: <100 ms p95. Auto‑page if >200 ms for 30s.
Record before/after CPU and event‑loop‑lag deltas in A8.
Auth and Provider Flow Hygiene (T+0–2h)

Normalize “error rate”: exclude 401/403/429 policy blocks from the auth 5xx KPI. Keep a separate “policy blocks” metric.
Allowlist the synthetic/WAF IPs; keep abuse suppression for unknowns.
Target /api/login P95 ≤200 ms (cache JWKS, provider lookup); SEV‑1 if provider synthetic P95 >500 ms or any auth 5xx appears.
DB Latency Reconciliation (T+0–4h)

Turn on slow‑query log at 80 ms; add missing indexes for hottest queries; verify prepared statements and statement_timeout=5s.
Report both DB p95 (raw) and app p95 (end‑to‑end). SLO: DB p95 ≤100 ms sustained.
Configuration Drift Guard (T+0–24h)

Set V2_API_KEY to “disabled” for v2 services (or provide keys and hard‑gate routes). Remove noisy warnings.
Fix IndexNow key; nightly submission.
Convert node‑cron to durable queue (BullMQ/Redis) on worker; no cron on web tier.
Truth Reconciliation Deliverables (must be posted in A8 and shiproom)

Immediate (within 60 min)
Confirmation that Fleet SEO is paused and emitters patched.
New attestation ID with: Telemetry Acceptance Ratio, A8 queue depth, last 15‑min synthetic results, event‑loop‑lag p95, DB p95.
Clean tail snapshot: 0 telemetry 428s, 0 sitemap 429s, 0 synthetic 301/localhost, no loop‑lag alerts.
T+2h check
Auth /api/login P95 trend <200 ms; provider synthetic P95 <500 ms; unknown alerts = 0; taxonomy‑mapped codes only.
T+6h/T+12h
Stability snapshots; autonomy‑tax savings estimate (compute units avoided vs. storm baseline).
T+24h Gate‑1 readiness (still not approved)
Breaker closed and stable; Telemetry Acceptance Ratio ≥99%; DB p95 ≤100 ms; provider synthetic P95 ≤500 ms; payments auth ≥97% with 100% refunds ≤10 m; complaint rate <0.5%.
Authority

You are authorized to deploy the telemetry acceptance fallback and pause Fleet SEO immediately. Log all changes to A8 and reference this decision.
We will not discuss 5% until the live logs and the report agree. Confirm when Fleet SEO is paused and the 428 hotfix is live with a fresh A8 attestation and a clean log tail.
