Acknowledged. Decision remains RED. No launch, no traffic scaling, no new features until P0s are cleared.

Executive directives (effective immediately)

War-room activation (Owner: CTO). 24/7 coverage, hourly Slack updates, 4-hour executive brief. Single source of truth doc with logs and checkpoints.
Freeze all non-P0 work and marketing spend for 72 hours. Engineering focus: schema integrity, analytics availability, SLO recovery, revenue observability.
Hard stop gates. Nothing ships until the acceptance criteria below are met and verified by audit.
P0 blockers, owners, deadlines, acceptance

DB schema integrity — 8 hours (Owner: DBA lead)
Fix: Restore missing cohort_users and reconcile migrations/drift.
Acceptance: 0 occurrences of 42P01 for 24h in app logs; cohort_users visible to the app; dependent queries succeed; migration report ID posted.
2. Analytics/BI availability — 12 hours (Owner: Frontend + Analytics)

Fix: Null-safety for TtvDashboardTile; API must return non-null fields or explicit 0s; add contract tests for medianTTV/MAU/conversion/ARPU.
Acceptance: Dashboard renders with numeric values; no null-pointer exceptions for 24h; trace IDs captured.
3. Revenue observability — 12 hours (Owner: Backend)

Fix: Expose read-only ARR summary (B2C/B2B) from existing data or cached job output; auth-protected; no writes.
Acceptance: arr_b2c_usd, arr_b2b_usd, arr_total_usd populated daily with timestamp and report ID.
4. SLO recovery — 24 hours (Owner: SRE/Infra)

Fix: Identify slow paths; implement caching, N+1 guards, and APM/error aggregation.
Acceptance: P95 ≤ 250ms and error rate ≤ 1.0% for 24h, with a documented plan to reach P95 ≤ 120ms and error ≤ 0.1% in 72h.
P1 items (parallel, do not block P0)

security.txt content-type correction to text/plain (Owner: Security) — 4 hours.
SEO inventory plan to scale beyond 155 URLs after SLOs stabilize (Owner: Growth Eng) — proposal due in 72 hours.
Move-to-Yellow gate (must all be true)

No schema errors (e.g., 42P01) for 24h.
MAU, conversion, ARR are non-null and logged daily.
P95 ≤ 250ms and error rate ≤ 1.0% for 24h; path to 120ms/0.1% defined.
Read-only revenue summary accessible to execs.
SLO dashboard and on-call alerts live with owners.
Copy-paste re-verification prompt (run every 6–8 hours; read-only)
Read-Only Delta Gate Check — ScholarshipAI Student Pilot
Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Strict read-only. Do not change data, configs, jobs, or integrations.

Objective
Verify closure of P0 blockers and readiness to move from RED to YELLOW. Provide PASS/WARN/FAIL, evidence IDs, and a go/no-go.

Checks and evidence
A) DB schema integrity

Expect: 0 occurrences of 42P01 (or equivalent) in last 24h; cohort_users visible to app.
Evidence: latest application/migration logs, row count or last_write_timestamp via existing diagnostics.
B) Analytics/BI

Expect: TtvDashboardTile renders; MAU, conversion, ARPU non-null.
Evidence: dashboard trace IDs; sample payload with fields: mau_28d, conversion_rate_pct, arpu_usd, medianTTV, p95TTV.
C) Revenue observability

Expect: Read-only ARR summary accessible (B2C, B2B, total) with timestamp.
Evidence: report name/ID and values.
D) SLOs (last 24h)

Expect: P95 ≤ 250ms, error rate ≤ 1.0%; include P50/P95/P99 snapshot.
Evidence: performance dashboard/log IDs.
E) Security parity

Expect: HSTS/CSP/X-Frame-Options unchanged; /.well-known/security.txt returns 200 text/plain.
Evidence: header capture and content-type.
F) SEO sanity

Expect: Valid sitemap; URL count reported; no XML errors.
Evidence: sitemap fetch logs.
G) Guardrails

Expect: Agent Bridge disabled or dry-run; no autonomous campaigns.
Evidence: config/status report ID.
KPIs to report (UNKNOWN = FAIL for MAU, conversion, or ARR)

MAU (28d, 90d), conversion rate, ARPU, ARR (B2C/B2B/Total), P95 latency, error rate, indexed pages.
Output

Executive summary (5–8 bullets) with decision: Green/Yellow/Red.
KPI table: Current, Target, Variance%, Status.
A–G with PASS/WARN/FAIL and evidence IDs.
Endpoint health: /health, /sitemap.xml, /.well-known/security.txt, analytics endpoints.
JSON: { "timestamp": "...", "instance": "...", "issues": {...}, "kpis": {...}, "decision": {"status": "Green|Yellow|Red", "justification": "...", "blockers": [{"owner": "", "eta_days": 0}]} }
Communication cadence

Hourly war-room updates; 4-hour executive checkpoints using the above output.
If any A–D item regresses, auto-revert recent changes and re-run the Gate Check within 60 minutes.
This preserves strict read-only validation while enforcing the path to measurable readiness.
