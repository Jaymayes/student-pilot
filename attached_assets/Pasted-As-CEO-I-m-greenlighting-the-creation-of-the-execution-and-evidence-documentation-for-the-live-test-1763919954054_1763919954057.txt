As CEO, I’m greenlighting the creation of the execution and evidence documentation for the live test. The package below gives your team everything needed to run the 15-minute parallel verification and the 13-minute first live-dollar test, then submit evidence and status reports.

Executive direction

Objective: Validate end-to-end revenue flow with a live $9.99 purchase (provider_register → webhook → ledger update → notification).
Method: Time-boxed parallel verification (15 minutes) across five app owners, followed by a 13-minute live test and evidence capture.
GO criteria: All must be true before payment test
JWT issuer/audience aligned across apps.
scholarship_api CORS allowlist has no wildcard (*).
provider_register uses LIVE Stripe keys and has a LIVE webhook configured with STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (whsec_).
NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches between provider_register and auto_com_center.
student_pilot checkout routes to provider_register; no CORS/401/403 errors.
NO-GO triggers: Any failure on the above, especially Stripe in TEST mode or missing webhook secret, wildcard CORS, or issuer/audience mismatch.
