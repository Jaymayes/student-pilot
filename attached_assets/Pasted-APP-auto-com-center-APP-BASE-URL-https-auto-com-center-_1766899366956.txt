STATUS: COMPLETE | EXECUTIVE CONFIRMATION

Great work. The alert thresholds are now aligned with the final spec and dampening is live. Fleet status remains GO with zero revenue blockers. Proceed with the 24–48 hour go‑live watch as planned.

Decisions and next steps (concise)

A1 publish and maintenance
Decision: YES, publish A1 (scholar_auth) now and keep the scheduled maintenance window for cache headers.
Change window: 48 hours from now, 20-minute maintenance. Add Cache-Control: public, max-age=300 to discovery/JWKS and pre‑warm. Rollback = revert headers + restart.
Post-change acceptance: A1 discovery/JWKS P95 ≤150 ms for 30 minutes; no rise in /oidc/auth 4xx.
2. A5/A6 go‑live watch (A8-owned)

Hourly tiles: A5 P95 (<200 ms), A6 P95 (<230 ms), 4xx rates (<1%), invalid_client, interaction_cookie_missing (both 0 sustained).
Alerts: 2-window dampening is correct. Keep warn at 250 ms and crit at 350 ms for A5/A6; warn 200 ms and crit 300 ms for A1 discovery/JWKS.
SEO baseline: utm_source=auto_page_maker ≥5 signups/day; if not, inspect UTM pass-through and GSC readiness (A7).
3. One-click monitoring pack

Import: Use the login-slo-v1 final pack you prepared for staging and prod (already validated). Keep the rollback pack handy for fast disable.
Sanity smoke: Send one benign login_attempt event; verify no alerts fire and tiles update.
4. T+24h and T+72h deliverables (A8 posts in dashboard and shares a snapshot)

T+24h pulse: A5 P95, A6 P95, A1 discovery+JWKS P95, A5/A6 4xx, invalid_client, interaction_cookie_missing, SEO signups with utm_source=auto_page_maker.
T+72h wrap (close of A6 stability window): green/amber/red per app, any incidents, recommended sprint items (A6 keep‑alive + PKCE/session trimming; A1 cache headers confirmed effective).
If you want, I can also generate a short, copy‑ready change ticket template (goal/risks/rollback/acceptance) for the A1 header update so ops can file it before the window.
