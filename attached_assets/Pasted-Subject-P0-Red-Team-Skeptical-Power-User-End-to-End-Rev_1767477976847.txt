Subject: P0 Red Team – “Skeptical Power User” End‑to‑End Revenue Assurance Audit

Role: Senior Revenue Assurance & Systems Integrity Architect
Mode: MAX AUTONOMOUS (Read/Probe-Only). Do NOT change code or configs. Your job is to ruthlessly surface Revenue Blockers, Integration Gaps, and Conversion Killers with irrefutable evidence.
Scope: scholar_auth (A1), scholarship_api (A2), scholarship_agent (A3), scholarship_sage (A4), student_pilot (A5), provider_register (A6), auto_page_maker (A7), auto_com_center (A8)

Mission

Execute a Red Team, “Skeptical Power User” E2E simulation that follows real money and provider value. Assume zero patience; any friction = churn.
Prove or disprove that value and context persist across every hand-off. A “200 OK” without business outcome is a FAIL.
Produce a single “Revenue Blocker Report” (format below) with screenshots, network traces, and precise integration failures.
Non‑Negotiables (enforce at every step)

No edits to code, secrets, or infra. Probing only.
Confirm v3.5.1 telemetry headers on all app→A8 or app→A2 events: x-scholar-protocol, x-app-label, x-event-id, X-API-Token, X-Service-Auth.
All probes must include identity headers in responses: X-System-Identity, X-App-Base-URL.
Health ≠ truth. Only count steps that create real business evidence (lead row, charge + webhook, provider listing, dashboard counters flipping).
SLO checks: P95 ≤150ms for user-facing endpoints during the run.
Test Persona and Data

Persona: “Skeptical Power User” (willing to pay, zero tolerance for friction).
Create fresh test accounts for isolation: skeptical_user+<timestamp>@example.com
Maintain a clean HAR/network capture and timestamped screenshots for each step.
The Golden Thread (B2C money path). Follow in order; at each step, critique the hand-off

Acquisition (A7 auto_page_maker → A5 student_pilot)
Action: Land on a top “Perfect Match” page. Click primary CTA (“Start Here”/“Find Matches”).
Verify:
Value prop clarity (would the persona care?) and LCP time.
UTMs preserved to A5 (utm_source, utm_campaign, utm_term).
A5 UI returns 200 with identity headers and not a 404/redirect loop.
Evidence: Screenshot + network trace showing UTM continuity.
2. Pre‑Sales Assist (A8 auto_com_center)

Action: Ask a buying-intent question (“What do I get if I upgrade now?”).
Verify: Does response explicitly drive to sign-up/upgrade in A5 with a working link? Or is it generic/passive?
Evidence: Chat transcript + clicked link target + arrival verification.
3. Gatekeeper (A1 scholar_auth via A5)

Action: Sign Up / Log In.
Verify:
OIDC flow completes; session cookie present; no “invalid_request”/“interaction failed.”
/api/probe/auth returns pass with identity headers.
Evidence: Set-Cookie headers + /api/probe/auth response + screenshot back in A5 logged-in UI.
4. Lead Capture (A5 → A2 scholarship_api → A8)

Action: Complete minimal onboarding to create a lead.
Verify:
Lead row persisted (A2) and event delivered to A8 (v3.5.1 headers present).
/api/probe/lead returns pass; DB ID correlates to persona.
Evidence: DB row or sanitized API response + A8 event view + probe output.
5. Money Moment (A5 + Stripe + Webhooks + A2/A8)

Action: Open Upgrade/Checkout and complete a canary purchase (env-appropriate: LIVE in prod; TEST in staging).
Verify:
Stripe element renders; mode is correct (no “Test Mode trap” in prod).
Webhook received and validated; idempotency key present.
Order/subscription row written; A8 Finance tile updates (3% provider fee, 4x AI services margin visible).
/api/probe/payment returns pass.
Evidence: Checkout screenshot, webhook log snippet (sanitized), order record, Finance tile update.
6. Immediate Value (A3 scholarship_agent → A2 → A8)

Action: Request personalized scholarship matches immediately after purchase.
Verify:
A3 calls A2 and returns high-relevance results (not generic filler).
A8 shows orchestration counters flipping for this session (app_identity, preflight_check, campaign_config, bandit_config, lead_pipeline, provider_pipeline, payment_config, analytics_ingest, dashboard_sync).
Evidence: Result set screenshot with user context; A8 counters before/after.
7. Confusion Rescue (A4 scholarship_sage)

Action: Ask “Help me prioritize the top 3 scholarships from my results.”
Verify:
Sage references the user’s recent searches and purchase state (context continuity). If it “doesn’t know,” mark as context loss.
Evidence: Chat transcript with explicit references to user/session artifacts.
8. Execution (A5 student_pilot)

Action: Attempt “Auto-Apply/Start Application” on one of the recommended scholarships.
Verify:
Pilot initiates real steps (document requests, forms, deadlines) without stalling on human-only tasks.
No broken deep links; no missing permissions; no silent failures.
Evidence: Workflow screenshots, task list emitted, success/failure logs.
The Provider Thread (B2B revenue path)
9) Provider Onboarding (A6 provider_register)

Action: Register a provider account; create a listing.
Verify:
Auth token from A1 works in A6; no 401/timeout.
Events provider_connected and listing_created posted to A2/A8 (v3.5.1 headers).
B2B tile in A8 updates; implied GMV visible.
Evidence: A6 UI, event logs, A8 B2B tile change.
10. Cross‑System Learning (A3 bandit_config + A7)

Action: Confirm bandit initialized and variants served on A7 pages.
Verify: Reward is conversion (not clicks); A8 learning metrics update.
Evidence: Variant assignment logs + A8 learning panel.
Systemic Checks (apply across all steps)

Fleet Health truthfulness: If any business probe fails, Fleet Health must be RED (not green due to ping-only checks).
Telemetry: No 401/403; all events are v3.5.1; fallback sink (A2) only if A8 unavailable.
Demo vs Live separation: Confirm proper namespace and no contamination of live analytics.
Output Requirement: Revenue Blocker Report (use this exact structure; add multiple entries if needed)

🚨 CRITICAL REVENUE BLOCKER: <Describe the exact quit/refund moment. Example: “Scholarship Sage ignored prior search; user felt unseen and requested refund.”>
📉 LEAKY FUNNEL WARNING: <Non-fatal friction. Example: “Auto Page Maker copy is vague; UTM landing LCP >3.0s.”>
🔗 INTEGRATION FAILURE: <Concrete hand-off failure. Example: “Student Pilot cannot read A3 result list; 404 on /results/:id.”>
💰 UPSIDE OPPORTUNITY: <Where we missed an upsell/cross-sell/expansion. Example: “No upgrade CTA after successful match delivery.”>
For each finding, include:

Severity: RS‑1 (Fatal), RS‑2 (High), RS‑3 (Medium), RS‑4 (Low)
Step in Flow: Acquisition / Auth / Lead / Money / Value / Sage / Pilot / Provider / Bandit
Evidence: URL, screenshot filenames, HAR/network excerpts, probe outputs
Suspected Root Cause (No code changes; name the boundary where data/context is lost)
Business Impact: Lost $/ARR/LTV implications
Proposed Diagnostic Next Step: The minimum additional telemetry or contract check to confirm

Stop conditions and Escalation

If any RS‑1 blocker is confirmed (e.g., lost session at A1→A5; payments in Test Mode in Live; A3 writing to local instead of A8), stop the run, flag “Revenue HALT,” and return the report immediately.
Otherwise, complete all steps and return the full report.
Begin now.
