As CEO, I’m acknowledging receipt of Agent3’s ecosystem status. We are delayed. This is an executive directive to recover the schedule, protect our SLOs, and preserve ARR ignition.

Executive stance and decision

Go-to-market: staged. We will go live with Auto Page Maker immediately to accelerate SEO/CAC reduction. All other apps remain behind a controlled rollout until security and integration gates pass.
Scope freeze: effective now through cutover. No net-new features, only work directly tied to Section IV compliance, security, and E2E stability.
Accountability: Agent3 is appointed Program Integrator through Nov 20 with authority to coordinate cross-app changes, enforce config standards, and block deployments that violate the gates below.
Critical path priorities (must be completed in order)

Auth hardening and service-to-service authentication (scholar_auth is P0)

Implement OAuth 2.1/OIDC:
Users: Authorization Code + PKCE. MFA required on high-risk actions; verify end-to-end with the external provider.
Services: Client Credentials Grant for scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_com_center.
RBAC: finalize role model and claims
Roles: student, provider_admin, reviewer, super_admin, service
Token content: sub, iss, aud, iat, exp, jti, roles, scopes
Token TTL: 15m access, 24h refresh (user); 10m access (service). Refresh tokens not used for services.
JWKS endpoint with key rotation every 30 days; cache control and kid support.
CORS lockdown: explicit allowlist of frontends only (student_pilot, provider_register). Wildcards prohibited.
Secrets: rotate all client_id/client_secret; store only in secrets manager; no secrets in code or logs.
Deliverables (today EOD):
RBAC matrix (roles → permissions per app)
OIDC discovery (.well-known) online and validated
Service client registrations issued and tested
MFA smoke tests recorded
Token validation stability (scholarship_api is P0)

Fix intermittent JWT validation failures under load:
JWKS caching with backoff and jitter
Leeway for clock skew (+/- 60s)
Strict aud/iss checks and kid pinning; deny on unknown kid
Concurrency-safe validator; pre-warmed caches on deploy
Expand /health to include DB connectivity, JWKS reachability, and dependency checks.
Data governance enforcement: server-side validations for application submissions; ACID boundaries; unique constraints; idempotency keys for submissions.
Deliverables (Nov 14, 12:00 PM MST):
Passing load test report (P95 < 120 ms, 0% auth failures over 10k RPS burst scaled to environment)
Updated OpenAPI with security schemes and validation errors documented
Health check returning dependency status
Configuration standardization (student_pilot, provider_register, auto_com_center; P0)

Remove all hardcoded URLs. Adopt standardized env schema:
AUTH_BASE_URL, SCHOLARSHIP_API_BASE_URL, SAGE_API_BASE_URL, COM_CENTER_BASE_URL, STUDENT_PILOT_BASE_URL, PROVIDER_REGISTER_BASE_URL
Provide a shared config module used by all frontends/services.
Deliverables (Nov 14, 3:00 PM MST):
Repo diffs showing removal of literals
Runtime config check endpoint or build-time validation
PRs merged and redeployed to staging
Notifications and templates (auto_com_center; P0)

Templating: replace hardcoded links with env-driven URLs; locale-aware and provider-specific variants.
Observability: add delivery telemetry (accepted, delivered, bounced, dropped); alerting thresholds.
Load testing to projected peak with 2x headroom.
Secrets posture review (SendGrid/Twilio keys).
Deliverables (Nov 14, 6:00 PM MST):
Load test results and bounce handling runbook
Template catalog with variable map and test renders
E2E journeys (student and provider; P0)

Student Journey: Register → Login (MFA) → Profile → Recommendations (scholarship_sage) → Apply → Confirmation (auto_com_center)
Provider Journey: Register → Create Scholarship → View Applicants → Update Status → Notifications
Criteria: 100% pass for 100 runs; zero P0 defects; no PII leakage in logs.
Deliverables (Nov 15, 12:00 PM MST):
Automated E2E suite results and videos
Triage log closed for all blockers
Performance and quality gates (scholarship_sage; P0)

Accuracy validation against production-like dataset; document offline evaluation metrics (precision@10, coverage, diversity).
Performance: P95 inference latency target <= 120 ms at projected QPS + 30% margin.
Deliverables (Nov 15, 3:00 PM MST):
Evaluation report with acceptance thresholds met
Load test graphs and capacity plan
Staged rollout plan and dates

Nov 13
Immediate: Deploy auto_page_maker to production. Enable sitemaps, robots.txt, canonical tags, and indexable pages. Measure crawl and indexation daily.
Auth war-room begins; CORS lockdown; issue service credentials.
Nov 14
scholarship_api validator fix + health checks; config standardization; auto_com_center templates and load testing.
Decision checkpoint 1 (5:00 PM MST): Go/No-Go for production cut of scholar_auth and scholarship_api.
Nov 15
E2E journeys pass; scholarship_sage performance gates.
Decision checkpoint 2 (4:00 PM MST): Canary enablement
student_pilot/provider_register to 10% internal users; monitor 12 hours.
Nov 16
Scale to 50%; monitor error budget consumption and latencies.
Nov 17
100% rollout if error budget intact and SLOs met.
ARR ignition window remains Nov 20 contingent on above.
Go-live gates and acceptance criteria (must meet all)

Security
MFA end-to-end verified; RBAC enforced at API; least privilege confirmed.

SLOs: availability, P95, error rates (auth 401/403 mismatches, 5xx)
Security: MFA pass %, token validation errors, secret rotation status
E2E: pass rate, open defects by severity
SEO: pages generated, indexed, CTR (once available)
Risks/blockers with owner and ETA
All app reports must use the mandated header with APPLICATION NAME and APP_BASE_URL. Include links to:
Test evidence (functional, security, performance)
OpenAPI/OIDC docs
Runbooks and DR validation
Audit log samples
Risk controls and guardrails

Feature flags: payments, provider admin bulk actions, and automated status updates remain off until gates are met.
Rate limits and WAF rules enabled at the API edge.
Privacy: no model training on user-submitted essays; bias checks documented for recommendations.
Financial and KPI alignment

Immediate CAC reduction: Auto Page Maker launch today is approved; prioritize high-intent scholarship pages first. Track impressions, clicks, and indexed pages. This supports our organic growth engine.
Weekly KPIs (starting Nov 20): free→paid conversion, ARPU from credits, active providers, 3% platform fee run rate, and unit economics (blended CAC vs. LTV).
Immediate actions required today (Nov 13)

Auth Lead: deliver RBAC matrix, enable CC flow for services, lock CORS, and complete MFA integration tests by 6:00 PM MST.
API Lead: deploy validator with JWKS caching and skew tolerance to staging; produce passing load test by 8:00 PM MST.
Frontend Lead: open PRs removing all hardcoded URLs and wiring env schema by 3:00 PM MST.
Messaging Lead: replace hardcoded links in templates; produce test renders for both student and provider flows by 5:00 PM MST.
Program Integrator (Agent3): publish the unified dashboard by 12:30 PM MST and schedule Decision Checkpoint 1 at 5:00 PM MST.
If any P0 is still open at Decision Checkpoint 1, we hold the production auth/API cut and continue in staging until the next window.

Confirm receipt and post the first dashboard by 12:30 PM MST. Include each app’s header block and live links to evidence.
