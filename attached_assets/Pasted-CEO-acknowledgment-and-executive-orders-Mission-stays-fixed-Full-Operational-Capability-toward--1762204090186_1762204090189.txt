CEO acknowledgment and executive orders

Mission stays fixed: Full Operational Capability toward $10M profitable ARR. I am not the operator; I am setting strategy, acceptance criteria, and GO/NO-GO gates. Agent3, execute only for your assigned application and return the mandatory Section 7 report with evidence.

Immediate executive directives

Identify: Determine your APP_BASE_URL and thus your application (see the directory you were given).
Isolate: Execute only the tasks in Section 4 for your app. Do not work outside your lane.
Interoperability: Conform to Section 5 standards (centralized auth via scholar_auth, scholarship_api as SSOT, HTTPS/TLS only, standardized JSON errors).
Lifecycle analysis: Complete Section 6 for your app type (Infrastructure 5–7 years, User-Facing 3–4 years, Intelligence/Automation 2–3 years).
Evidence discipline: Every task you mark Complete must include deterministic evidence (see Evidence Checklist) with request_id correlation. No screenshots alone; provide machine-verifiable artifacts.
Platform-level GO/NO-GO gates (unchanged)

Hard Gate 1: provider_register OAuth PKCE evidence bundle
Required artifacts: HAR of full PKCE flow; decoded ID token showing roles=Provider, valid iss/aud, signature verified against scholar_auth JWKS; server logs with request_id; 401/403 RBAC tests; refresh rotation proof; SHA256 manifest.
SLA: Deliver within 10 minutes of receiving valid client credentials. Escalate at T+5 if blocked.
Hard Gate 2: auto_com_center T+90 canary
Exact green criteria:
Zero loss at 2× peak (60,000 events @ 1000/min)
P95 dispatch <250ms
Heap <85% sustained
DLQ = 0
Error ≤0.1%
Opt-out processed <5s with evidence
Rollback plan SHA-verified
Observe-only posture across the platform until this canary is GREEN.
Acceptance evidence checklist (all apps)

For each completed task, attach:

API proof: curl commands and raw responses (HTTP code, headers, body). Include request_id in the response or show it in headers.
Logs: Redacted server logs with request_id matching the API proof.
Traces/metrics: Trace or metrics excerpt tying to the same request_id (or timestamp + route + instance id).
Security: Headers summary (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.), HTTPS/TLS confirmation.
RBAC/Auth: JWT/JWKS verification steps where applicable (issuer, audience, kid, alg; signature verification result).
Data integrity: Validation errors tested and returning standardized JSON structure.
SHA256 manifest: Filenames and checksums for all artifacts.
Lifecycle and revenue cessation analysis (Section 6 guidance)

Infrastructure (e.g., Auth, API, Comms): Estimate 5–7 years. Consider protocol evolution (OIDC/OAuth changes, PQC), scale limits, vendor/runtime EOL, and security posture. Define triggers that accelerate refresh (e.g., new auth standard, PQC mandate).
User-facing (e.g., Student Pilot, Provider Register): Estimate 3–4 years. Tie to UX trends, CVW/INP thresholds, accessibility benchmarks, and conversion performance plateaus.
Intelligence/Automation (e.g., Sage, Agent, Page Maker): Estimate 2–3 years. Tie to AI model advances, data pipeline changes, and explainability/compliance needs.
Mandatory reporting format

Return your report exactly in the format below. Do not add sections or change headings.

*** BEGIN REPORT ***

APPLICATION IDENTIFICATION
Application Name: [e.g., scholar_auth]
APP_BASE_URL: [Your APP_BASE_URL here]
Application Type: [Infrastructure/User Facing/Intelligence/Automation]

TASK COMPLETION STATUS

Task 4.X.1: [Status: Complete/In Progress/Blocked] - [Notes/Verification Details + Evidence links: curl output, request_id, logs, traces, SHA256 manifest entry]
Task 4.X.2: [Status: ...] - [Notes/Evidence]
Task 4.X.3: [Status: ...] - [Notes/Evidence]
Task 4.X.4: [Status: ...] - [Notes/Evidence]
INTEGRATION VERIFICATION

Connection with [Dependent App Name]: [Status: Verified/Failed] - [How tested, request_id, API responses, logs, traces]
Connection with [Dependent App Name]: [Status: ...] - [Details]
LIFECYCLE AND REVENUE CESSATION ANALYSIS

Estimated Revenue Cessation/Obsolescence Date: [e.g., Q4 2028]
Rationale: [Concrete factors per Section 6 for your app type]
Contingencies: [What accelerates or extends lifespan, with explicit triggers and monitoring signals]
OPERATIONAL READINESS DECLARATION
[FOC Readiness: READY / NOT READY]
CEO STANDING DIRECTIVE ACKNOWLEDGED - PLATFORM RESILIENCY EMPHASIS CONFIRMED

*** END REPORT ***

Submission SLA and escalation

SLA: Submit your completed Section 7 report within 2 hours of receiving this order.
If any task is Blocked >30 minutes due to an external dependency, escalate with a concise blocker report:
What: The specific failing step and endpoint
Evidence: Last command, HTTP code/body, request_id, logs
Owner: Team needed to unblock
ETA: Your earliest completion time once unblocked
Strategic alignment reminders

Think data-first: Every claim must be backed by logs, metrics, traces, and reproducible commands.
Student value is business value: Performance and reliability that lift conversion are non-negotiable (target P95 ≤120ms, uptime ≥99.9%, error ≤0.1%).
Prioritize organic growth: Keep Auto Page Maker healthy and fast; protect CWV and SEO. Observe-only comms until auto_com_center canary is green.
Lean and autonomous: Execute within your scope; escalate only for true external dependencies.
Act with urgency: The $10M ARR plan depends on clearing the two hard gates. Time-box and escalate.
Agent3, reply in this thread with your completed Section 7 report using the exact format above, including evidence artifacts and SHA256 manifest references. I will issue GO/NO-GO for your application upon evidence review.
