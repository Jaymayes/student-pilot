Unified Master Execution Prompt for Agent3
Read carefully. You must only act on the section labeled for your app. Ignore every other section. The objective is to get all eight apps fully operational and working together today. If you cannot reach revenue-readiness today, you must provide a clear ETA to start generating revenue and list the third-party systems that must be in place.

Global execution guardrails for all apps

Scope discipline: Execute only the section for your app. Do not modify or run other sections.
Success definition: “Revenue-ready today” means your app can perform its role in the live revenue flow with all necessary third-party integrations configured, health checks passing, and cross-app integrations verified.
Reporting header: Every report you generate must start with the single line: APP_NAME — APP_BASE_URL Example: student_pilot — https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Minimum deliverables (create these files in your repo):
GO_LIVE_READINESS_REPORT.md
DAY0_READINESS_REPORT.md
INTEGRATION_MATRIX.md
SECURITY_COMPLIANCE.md
PERF_SNAPSHOT.json
SMOKE_TEST_RESULTS.md
SLO_SNAPSHOT.md
Health endpoints: Implement GET /health and GET /ready (or /readyz). They must return 200 when healthy. Include response times in PERF_SNAPSHOT.json.
Security baselines:
JWT RS256 validation using scholar_auth JWKS
x-api-key for internal service-to-service endpoints where specified
Rate limiting for public endpoints
CORS allowlist limited to known frontends and partner apps
SLOs and ethics:
99.9% uptime target, P95 latency ≤ 120ms
No ghostwriting or academic dishonesty assistance; guidance-only where applicable
Bias mitigation and transparent behavior; no black boxes
Final output required: After you complete your section, append this status line to your Go-Live Readiness Report and in your console logs: App: APP_NAME | APP_BASE_URL: <url> | Status: GREEN/YELLOW/RED | Revenue today: YES/CONDITIONAL/NO | ETA to start revenue: <time or 0 hours> | Third-party prerequisites: <list> | Blockers: <none or list>
“Dry-run” mode: If a required third-party key is missing, implement dry-run behavior (log-only) and declare it clearly in your report with exact steps to go live once keys are provided.
BEGIN APP SECTION: scholar_auth — https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mission

Provide identity and access management for the platform. Issue RS256 JWTs, expose JWKS, support email verification, login, refresh, and introspection. Enable both OIDC-standard flows and simple REST adapters so all apps can integrate today.
Required endpoints and behavior

OIDC Core (preferred if already implemented):
GET /.well-known/openid-configuration (or /oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration if legacy)
GET /oidc/jwks (JWKS)
POST /oidc/token (authorization_code and refresh_token)
REST adapters (required if any consumer is not OIDC-ready):
POST /auth/register {email, password, name, role}
POST /auth/login {email, password} → returns {access_token, refresh_token, expires_in}
POST /auth/refresh {refresh_token} → returns new tokens
POST /auth/verify-email {token}
POST /auth/introspect {token} → returns validity, subject, roles, scopes
Email verification integration:
On registration, call auto_com_center /events/email with template_id=verification and variables {name, verify_link}
Security
RS256 JWTs with exp, iat, iss, aud. Issuer = this app. Include role claim (student, provider, admin).
Publish JWKS at /oidc/jwks. If you currently serve at another path, either add this route or document the exact live JWKS URL in INTEGRATION_MATRIX.md.
Health: GET /health and GET /ready return 200.
Secrets

JWT_PRIVATE_KEY (PEM), JWT_PUBLIC_KEY (PEM)
INTERNAL_API_KEY (for trusted internal calls)
AUTO_COM_CENTER_BASE_URL
AUTO_COM_CENTER_API_KEY
Integration tests (must pass)

Register + verify + login (REST)
OIDC token retrieval and JWKS fetch by scholarship_api
Outbound email to auto_com_center in dry-run if keys missing
Revenue-ready assessment

If REST adapters can be added today: target timeline ≤ 4 hours.
If you choose OIDC-only today, ensure student_pilot and other apps are confirmed compatible; otherwise add REST adapters.
Deliverable must-include notes

In GO_LIVE_READINESS_REPORT.md: clearly document final JWKS URL and supported flows (OIDC, REST, or both). Include any deviations and ETA to resolve.
