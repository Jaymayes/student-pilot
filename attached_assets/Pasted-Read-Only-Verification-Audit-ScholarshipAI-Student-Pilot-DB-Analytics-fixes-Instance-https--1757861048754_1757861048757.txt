Read-Only Verification Audit — ScholarshipAI Student Pilot (DB + Analytics fixes)
Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Strict read-only diagnostic. Do not modify data, config, jobs, or integrations. Do not trigger migrations, reindexing, or cache clears. Use only existing telemetry, logs, stored reports, and currently exposed read-only endpoints. If data is missing, return UNKNOWN and specify the minimal instrumentation to collect it.

Objective
Validate that the critical issues identified in the prior RED audit are resolved and that we can measure progress toward Year 1 targets without changing the system. Provide PASS/WARN/FAIL judgments with evidence links/IDs and a go/no-go recommendation.

Issues to re-verify (must all pass)
A) Database schema integrity

Confirm the cohort_users relation now exists and is queryable by the application (no 42P01 errors).
Evidence required: latest application logs and/or migration logs showing successful initialization; last error occurrence timestamp; count of rows or last-modified timestamp surfaced via existing diagnostics only (no direct DB writes or schema changes).
B) Analytics/BI availability

TtvDashboardTile no longer throws null pointer exceptions; MAU, conversion, ARPU, and TTV metrics render with non-null values.
Evidence: dashboard render logs/trace IDs, component health logs, and the first/last successful data fetch timestamps.
C) Revenue observability

Ability to read current B2C/B2B MRR/ARR from existing reports or telemetry. If billing endpoints are protected, use stored summaries or last successful job output.
Evidence: report names/IDs, log lines showing values and timestamps.
D) Performance SLOs

P95 API latency ≤120ms over the last 24h (or closest available window).
Error rate ≤0.1% (5xx plus application-level failures).
Evidence: performance dashboard/log IDs; distribution snapshot (P50/P95/P99) and error histogram.
E) Security and compliance parity

Security posture unchanged or improved: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options present; /.well-known/security.txt returns 200.
Evidence: header captures, status codes, and last pen-test/scan summary reference if stored.
F) SEO machine health (sanity)

Sitemap is healthy and enumerates programmatic pages; page count reported; no critical XML errors.
Evidence: sitemap fetch logs and sitemap validator output (internal).
G) Operational guardrails

Agent Bridge remains disabled or in dry-run; no autonomous campaigns executing.
Evidence: config snapshot or last agent scheduler/status report.
KPIs to report (Current vs Year 1 target; mark UNKNOWN if unavailable)

MAU (28d, 90d)
Free→Paid conversion rate
ARPU (credit sales)
Churn
LTV
CAC by channel (SEO, direct, referral)
B2C ARR, B2B ARR, Total ARR
P95 latency (24h), error rate (24h)
Indexed pages (count from sitemap or internal inventory)
Scoring thresholds

Variance >10% vs plan = WARN; >20% = FAIL.
Any UNKNOWN on MAU, conversion, or ARR = FAIL for this verification.
Output format

Executive summary (5–8 bullets) with a clear decision: Green/Yellow/Red.
KPI table with Current, Target, Variance%, Status (PASS/WARN/FAIL).
Issue re-verify results (A–G) with PASS/WARN/FAIL and evidence (report names, log IDs, timestamps).
Endpoint health table (read-only): /health, /robots.txt, /sitemap.xml, /.well-known/security.txt, and any analytics endpoints used. Include status code, last-seen P95 latency, last error, log/trace ID.

If any item is UNKNOWN, list the minimal instrumentation required (name the metric, exact event/schema or log needed, and where to surface it).
Constraints

Do not execute migrations, schema changes, jobs, or external calls. Report only on what exists. If logs or dashboards are absent, return UNKNOWN with a concrete instrumentation recommendation.
