CEO DECISION: Proceed via Option 2 — Replit Republish for scholar_auth. Human operator is temporarily assigned as Auth DRI for EPD-Auth-01.

Why: Fastest path to Gate 1 GREEN without new infra accounts. FOC remains blocked until scholar_auth is live and validating tokens.

Immediate actions and ownership (T+0 to T+20)

Auth DRI (Temporary: YOU, for scholar_auth)

Reply in-line now: “EPD-Auth-01 executing now”
In Replit: click Republish for scholar_auth (v2.7)
Post back two items to war room:
ISSUER_URL and JWKS_URL actually serving over HTTPS
Health check: /login reachable (200) and JWKS endpoint returns keys
Upon confirmation, launch the dual-issuer grace window if any services still cache old keys. Notify all DRIs that Gate 1 is GREEN.
API DRI (scholarship_api)

Trigger immediately on Gate 1 GREEN: Publish v2.7
Run Section 4.2 verification; post evidence within 15 minutes:
200/401/403 matrix for protected routes
RBAC enforcement proof
Input validation tests and injection guards
Integration checks to/from provider_register, scholarship_agent, student_pilot, scholarship_sage, auto_page_maker
Declare Gate 2 GREEN when complete.
Comms DRI (auto_com_center)

Maintain dry-run: DISABLE_SEND=true
Collect Gate 3 evidence bundle: queue depth/latency P95, suppression traces, rendered templates (PII-redacted), idempotency logs, zero-send proof.
Do not activate 1% canary until CEO approval post Gate 3.
Provider DRI (provider_register)

On Gate 2 GREEN, execute 5-minute plan:
P0: 3% platform fee disclosure visible
RBAC tenant isolation 403 proof
scholarship_api /canary v2.7 healthy
Fee accrual logging ON; ledger sample showing 3% calc
Frontend DRI (student_pilot)

On Gate 2 GREEN, run E2E smoke (auth, profile CRUD, search, recommendations, application submit)
Report: Lighthouse Accessibility ≥90, P95 page load ≤2.5s, HAR + defects.csv
Sage DRI (scholarship_sage)

Capture ≥30 recommendation samples; post latency distribution and accuracy spot-checks
Confirm M2M auth with scholarship_api and CORS allowlist
Agent DRI (scholarship_agent)

Validate M2M SystemService token, retry/backoff, circuit breaker behavior
Verify event emission to auto_com_center (dry-run)
SEO DRI (auto_page_maker)

Verify webhook/event trigger on scholarship creation/update
Confirm schema.org metadata, titles/descriptions, public accessibility
Mandatory reporting (all DRIs)

Section 7 reports due T+60 using provided format. Evidence artifacts required for each task item.
Go/No-Go criteria to exit dry-run and start 1% canary (CEO gate)
All must be true:

Auth: Token validation success ≥98% across services; JWKS resolvable; 401/403 matrix correct
API: P95 ≤120ms; 5xx <0.5%; input validation proven; RBAC enforced
Frontend: E2E success, Accessibility ≥90, no P0/P1 defects
Comms: Queue P95 under 120ms; zero-send proof; unsubscribe end-to-end verified; templates render correctly
Provider: 3% fee disclosure verified; 403 cross-tenant proof; fee ledger accurate
Sage/Agent/Page Maker: Data freshness, event triggers and SEO metatags verified; ≥30 rec samples captured with SLOs met
If GREEN on all, I will authorize:

1% canary send for auto_com_center to an internal test cohort for 30 minutes; hold at 1% until metrics confirm stability, then ramp to 5–10% in controlled steps.
Standardized error and security directives (reaffirmed)

401: Unauthenticated; 403: Authenticated but RBAC denied
Error JSON (all services): { "error": "<human_message>", "code": "<MACHINE_CODE>", "status": <int>, "trace_id": "<uuid>" }
HTTPS/TLS only; CORS restricted; rate limiting enabled; HttpOnly/SameSite cookies or secure storage for tokens
Lifecycle and revenue risk posture (portfolio view)

Infrastructure (auth, api, comms): Plan for major refresh by 5–7 years or earlier if standards move beyond OAuth 2.0/JWT
Intelligence/Automation (sage, agent, page maker): Expect core model/logic refreshes every 2–3 years to maintain differentiation
User-facing (student_pilot, provider_register): Major UX refresh cycle ~3–4 years to sustain conversion and ARPU
Your immediate step (Auth DRI temp assignment)

Reply exactly: “EPD-Auth-01 executing now”
Then Republish scholar_auth in Replit and post ISSUER_URL + JWKS_URL. This starts the clock for Gate 1 GREEN.
I will not authorize the 1% canary until Gate 1 and Gate 2 are GREEN and all Go/No-Go criteria are met. Act with urgency and post evidence to the war room as each gate turns GREEN.
