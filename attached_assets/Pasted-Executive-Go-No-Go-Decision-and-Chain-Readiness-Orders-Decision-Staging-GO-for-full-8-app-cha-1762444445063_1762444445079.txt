Executive Go/No-Go Decision and Chain Readiness Orders

Decision

Staging: GO for full 8‑app chain validation today as scheduled. Maintain observe-only where specified.
Production: LOCKED. Next formal go/no-go at Nov 8, 18:30 UTC, contingent on all gates below.
Controlled ramp: Target Nov 9 at 1% if gates met; ARR ignition Nov 12 remains approved.
Immediate Deadlines and Escalations (today)

16:00 UTC: Secrets (Postmark, Sentry DSNs, AWS SQS/DLQ IAM) due. Auto‑escalate at 16:01 UTC if any missing.
17:00 UTC: SPF/DKIM/DMARC “green” for mail.scholaraiadvisor.com. If not green at 17:01 UTC, hold outbound and execute logs-only validation.
21:00 UTC: Auto Command Center STAGING_VALIDATION.md due (evidence package below).
21:15 UTC: Chain‑wide roll‑up summary due (each DRI submits).
App‑by‑App CEO Assessment, Orders, and Go-Live Targets

scholar_auth

Staging: GO under Plan B. Cosmetic error page is acceptable for staging.
Production: LOCKED pending Option A fix by Nov 7, 18:00 UTC. If not met, proceed with Express‑level override by Nov 7, 18:00 UTC as documented fallback.
Orders: Publish CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md and M2M secret rotation today; notify all DRIs on completion.
scholarship_api

Staging: GO on auth clearance. ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md required.
Production: CONDITIONAL. Needs cross‑app request_id correlation and P95 ≤120ms (reads), ≤150ms (writes), error <0.1%, ACID proof, RBAC token validation.
Orders: On trigger, fan‑out events to auto_page_maker + auto_com_center; provide Sentry trace URLs.
scholarship_agent

Staging: GO in observe‑only mode; email‑only notifications via auto_com_center; no auto‑apply.
Production: CONDITIONAL. Requires fairness telemetry and “Why this match?” explainability evidence in roll‑up.
Orders: Monitor chain KPIs and file escalation if any gate drifts.
scholarship_sage

Staging: READY. Begin 48‑hour observe‑only baseline immediately upon M2M secret rotation.
Production: CONDITIONAL on baseline completion + fairness telemetry + explainability evidence.
Orders: Deliver baseline_metrics_evidence.md at +48h with precision@5, coverage, fairness, P95, error rate, uptime, request_id traces.
student_pilot

Staging: READY; execute 95‑step cross‑browser E2E within 10 minutes of auth clearance.
Production: CONDITIONAL. Requires First Document Upload activation proof (north‑star KPI), Stripe test flow proof, cross‑app tracing.
Orders: Deliver E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md with screenshots and SLOs.
provider_register

Staging: READY; execute ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md within 10 minutes of auth clearance.
Production: CONDITIONAL. Requires PKCE + roles=Provider JWT proof; CRUD to scholarship_api; cross‑app traces; P95 ≤120ms; error <0.1%.
Orders: Report time‑to‑first‑scholarship‑published and provider→first‑applicant metrics.
auto_page_maker

Staging: READY; maintain noindex/robots discipline. Execute +2 pages within 60 seconds on scholarship_api Order 4 event.
Production: CONDITIONAL. Requires CWV p75 green, request_id traces, IndexNow receipts, P95 ≤120ms, rollback guard.
Orders: Provide sitemap diffs, IndexNow receipts, CWV snapshots.
auto_com_center (Auto Command Center)

Staging: GO on secrets; email‑only via Postmark. SMS deferred to Nov 11 EOD.
Production: LOCKED until deliverability and observability gates pass.
Orders: Deliver STAGING_VALIDATION.md by 21:00 UTC with:
Unsubscribe under 5s at 100 concurrent (summary + histogram)
DLQ=0 (SQS/DLQ metric screenshot + 15‑min Prometheus)
SPF/DKIM/DMARC “green” proof (DNS TXT + test report)
P95 ≤120ms end‑to‑end (15‑ and 60‑min Grafana)
Error <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9% panels for validation window
request_id traces with Sentry correlation across 8 apps (≥1 trace URL: auth→API→UX→comms)
Compliance artifacts (CAN‑SPAM/TCPA/FERPA/COPPA: headers, consent logs, suppression, age gating)
Prometheus snapshots (latency, error rate, queue depth, bounce/retry, suppression)
Production Unlock Gates (must all be green to start 1% ramp on Nov 9)

Cross‑app request_id correlation with Sentry trace links for representative E2E flows (auth→provider_register→scholarship_api→auto_page_maker; auth→student_pilot→scholarship_agent→auto_com_center).
SLOs: P95 ≤120ms (service‑level), uptime ≥99.9%, error <0.1% over 24h.
Email deliverability: SPF/DKIM/DMARC “green,” unsubscribe <5s at 100 concurrent, DLQ=0.
Compliance: Evidence packages approved (CAN‑SPAM/TCPA/FERPA/COPPA); fairness telemetry and explainability active where applicable.
B2C activation: First Document Upload captured in staging E2E.
B2B pathway: Provider publishes scholarship and receives first applicant in staging.
If 100% readiness is not possible today

New dates are approved as follows:
scholar_auth production readiness: Nov 7, 18:00 UTC (Option A fix or Express override).
auto_com_center SMS enablement: Nov 11, 23:59 UTC.
Controlled ramp start: Nov 9, 16:00 UTC (1%) contingent on gates above.
ARR ignition: Nov 12, 16:00 UTC. No change.
Any slip against the above must be escalated with a quantified impact on ARR and a revised recovery plan the same day.
KPI Operating Targets for the Next 72 Hours

B2B: Providers onboarded, scholarships published, provider→first applicant conversion time; target first provider→first applicant within staging today.
B2C: First Document Upload activation rate; Stripe test success; session→activation conversion.
Platform: P95 ≤120ms; error <0.1%; uptime ≥99.9%; email deliverability ≥98% inbox placement (post‑DNS green).
SEO: auto_page_maker CWV p75 green; indexing discipline intact; +2 page trigger validated.
Capital Allocation and Constraints

No paid acquisition. SEO-first growth via auto_page_maker remains primary CAC lever.
Approve operational spend necessary for: Postmark credits, Sentry seats/retention, AWS SQS/DLQ, DNS provider updates. Keep within current monthly budget envelope; CFO to flag exceptions immediately.
Risk and Ethics Controls

Maintain observe-only for scholarship_agent and scholarship_sage through baseline period.
Enforce Responsible AI: fairness telemetry, explainability, audit trails. No auto‑apply in staging.
Compliance: Do not send production email/SMS until DNS is green and unsubscribe performance meets threshold; do not process under‑age data without age gating and verified consent.
Deliverables and Format Reminders (mandatory)

Every evidence file starts with:
Application: <app_name>
APP_BASE_URL: <url>
DRIs deliver to e2e/reports/<app_name>/ and include Sentry trace links, Prometheus/Grafana screenshots, and raw metrics exports where applicable.
Final CEO Instruction

Proceed with the staged validation today exactly as outlined. Maintain production lock until all gates are evidenced. Escalate at 16:01 and 17:01 UTC if secrets or DNS are not green. Deliver the 21:00 UTC Auto Command Center package and the 21:15 UTC chain roll‑up with explicit GO/NO‑GO recommendation for Nov 9 1% ramp, including any residual risks to the Nov 12 ARR ignition milestone.
I will review the 21:15 UTC roll‑up personally and issue final ramp authorization if all gates are green.
