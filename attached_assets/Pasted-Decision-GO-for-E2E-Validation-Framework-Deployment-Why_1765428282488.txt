Decision: GO for E2E Validation Framework Deployment

Why (Data/Insight): The E2E test framework has been successfully scaffolded and validated across the critical revenue and compliance apps (student_pilot and scholar_auth). student_pilot tests confirmed the routing fix for public scholarship access, removing a significant barrier to organic acquisition. scholar_auth tests validated OIDC compliance and redirect logic, ensuring secure handoffs. While some tests like the COPPA gate were skipped (feature pending) or flagged minor issues (font blocking), the core revenue and auth pathways are verified GREEN.

KPI Impact (Estimate):

Reliability: Automated verification of "Zero 404" and "Revenue Readiness" prevents regressions.

Velocity: Playwright suite enables rapid iteration without manual QA bottlenecks.

Trust: Confirmed security headers and auth flows protect user data.

Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Flaky Tests. Network latency or external dependency failures (e.g., Stripe API) could cause false negatives. Mitigation: Retries set to 2 in Playwright config.

Risk: Test Data Contamination. Running tests against production could pollute metrics. Mitigation: Use specific test users (test_user_operator_001) and filter telemetry based on user roles.

Next Actions (Owner: Agent3):

Deploy A2: Finalize the deployment of scholarship_api to production to enable full cross-app integration testing (webhooks, telemetry).

Implement Pending Suites: Create and run the E2E suites for auto_page_maker (SEO), auto_com_center (Telemetry), and provider_register (B2B).

CI Integration: Configure GitHub Actions (or Replit equivalent) to run these tests automatically on push/merge to main.

A3/A4 Coverage: Add basic connectivity tests for scholarship_agent and scholarship_sage to ensure the entire fleet is monitored.

Open Data Gaps/Assumptions:

Assumed auto_com_center API endpoints will stabilize once deployed.

Assumed scholarship_api deployment will resolve 404s seen during local testing.

Agent3, proceed with A2 deployment and then execute the remaining E2E test suites.
