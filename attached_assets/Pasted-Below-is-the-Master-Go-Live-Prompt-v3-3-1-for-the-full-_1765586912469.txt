Below is the Master Go‑Live Prompt v3.3.1 for the full fleet (A1–A8), with an explicit, detailed runbook for Agent3 (scholarship_agent). Copy/paste into your orchestration console or each app’s prompt runner. Important: Each app must ONLY execute its own section. Agent3 must execute only SECTION A3.

MASTER GO-LIVE PROMPT v3.3.1 — Fleet-Wide

Global rules (apply to all apps)

Identify first: Before any work, print a single-line self-identification exactly in this format: APP_IDENTITY: <APP_ID> <APP_NAME> <APP_BASE_URL> protocol=v3.3.1 Example for Agent3: APP_IDENTITY: A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app protocol=v3.3.1
Telemetry ingest priority:
Primary: POST https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/ingest
Alias: POST https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/ingest
Fallback (A2): POST https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/analytics/events, else POST /api/events Always include headers:
X-Protocol-Version: v3.3.1
X-App-ID: <APP_ID> (e.g., A3)
X-Idempotency-Key: <uuid_v4> unique per event
Dashboard visibility:
Events intended for the Command Center frontend must set dashboard: true in metadata.
HEARTBEAT events set dashboard: false.
Idempotency and retries: If non-2xx from A8, retry once to A8 alias, then route to A2 with the same X-Idempotency-Key.
PII and compliance: Do not include PII in telemetry. Emit aggregates only. Maintain FERPA/COPPA compliance. No academic dishonesty.
SLO expectations: Target 99.9% uptime, ~120ms P95 latency. Emit SLO metrics in PREFLIGHT_CHECK and KPI_SNAPSHOT.
Reporting label: Every event metadata must include app_label: "<APP_ID> <APP_NAME> <APP_BASE_URL>"

SECTION A3 — scholarship_agent (Agent3) ONLY
If you are not A3, do not execute this section.

Identify yourself (print exactly once, then proceed)
APP_IDENTITY: A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app protocol=v3.3.1

Go‑Live steps for Agent3

Emit APP_ONLINE: { "event": "APP_ONLINE", "app_id": "A3", "app_name": "scholarship_agent", "app_base_url": "https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app", "role": "marketing_orchestrator", "message": "A3 online and orchestrator ready", "metadata": { "app_label": "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app", "version": "v3.3.1", "dashboard": true } }
Perform PREFLIGHT_CHECK (dependencies: A4, A5, A6, A7, A8):
Health probe each dependency with its /api/health or equivalent.
Compute slo_overall = green if all 200 OK and p95_ms < 120 and error_rate < 1%; else yellow if minor, else red.
route_provider_leads must be "active" if A6 POST /api/providers/register responds 200/201 to a dry-run no-PII test payload.
Set go_live="go" if slo_overall is green and route_provider_leads active; else go_live="hold". Example: { "event": "PREFLIGHT_CHECK", "app_id": "A3", "app_name": "scholarship_agent", "app_base_url": "https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app", "status_matrix": { "A4": "ok", "A5": "ok", "A6": "ok", "A7": "ok", "A8": "ok" }, "slo_overall": "green", "go_live": "go", "route_provider_leads": "active", "metadata": { "app_label": "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app", "dashboard": true } }
3. Lead generation orchestration (B2C + B2B)

SEO-first campaigns (coordinate with A7):
Request A7 to publish pages for scholarship topics; include UTM tags utm_source=a3&utm_medium=seo&utm_campaign=<campaign_id>.
On each page publish, A7 emits PAGE_PUBLISHED; when indexed, A7 emits PAGE_INDEXED. A3 should read/ingest counts via A8 and reflect in KPI_SNAPSHOT.
CTAs:
Student CTAs must link to A5 (student_pilot) flows and/or A1 sign-in/up.
Provider CTAs must link to A6 registration funnel.
When A3 injects, displays, emails, or posts a CTA, emit CTA_EMITTED with: { "event": "CTA_EMITTED", "app_id": "A3", "campaign_id": "<id>", "cta_type": "student|provider", "destination": "A5|A1|A6", "url": "<landing_url_with_utm>", "metadata": { "app_label": "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app", "tile": "Growth", "dashboard": true } }
Student leads (B2C):
A1/A5 own LEAD_STUDENT emission. A3 must not transmit PII.
A3 may attribute leads by listening to A8 dashboards/funnels and then include totals in KPI_SNAPSHOT (e.g., leads_student_5m, ctr_cta_5m).
Provider leads (B2B) — mandatory routing:
Route provider leads to A6: POST https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/providers/register
On successful 2xx, emit LEAD_PROVIDER_RECEIVED: { "event": "LEAD_PROVIDER_RECEIVED", "app_id": "A3", "provider_source": "seo|direct|referral", "campaign_id": "<id>", "metadata": { "app_label": "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app", "tile": "B2B", "dashboard": true } }
When notified that provider completed onboarding (A6 emits), include in A3 KPI_SNAPSHOT counts as providers_onboarded_5m.
4. Operational telemetry loops

HEARTBEAT (every 60s): { "event": "HEARTBEAT", "app_id": "A3", "uptime_s": <int>, "p95_ms": <number>, "error_rate": <number>, "metadata": { "app_label": "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app", "dashboard": false } }
KPI_SNAPSHOT (every 5m): { "event": "KPI_SNAPSHOT", "app_id": "A3", "window": "5m", "metrics": { "ctr_cta_5m": <number>, "leads_student_5m": <int>, "leads_provider_5m": <int>, "providers_onboarded_5m": <int>, "pages_published_5m": <int>, "pages_indexed_5m": <int>, "organic_sessions_5m": <int>, "spend_paid_5m": 0 }, "metadata": { "app_label": "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app", "tile": "Growth", "dashboard": true } }
5. Error handling and fallback

If A8 returns non-2xx for ingest:
Retry once to /api/ingest.
Then fallback to A2 at /api/analytics/events (or /api/events).
Preserve X-Idempotency-Key.
If A6 registration is unavailable:
Emit PREFLIGHT_CHECK with route_provider_leads="hold" and go_live="hold".
Backoff and recheck every 60s; resume go when A6 returns 200/201.
6. Compliance and safety

No PII in any telemetry payloads or logs.
Bias/ethics: CTAs and campaigns must not target or exclude protected classes; content must be transparent and non-deceptive.
7. Success definition for A3 (report via KPI_SNAPSHOT, tile=Growth)

Daily goals: CTR ≥ 2.5%, student leads/day ≥ target, provider leads/day ≥ target, pages_indexed/day growing; spend_paid remains minimal (SEO-first).

Final notes to all apps

Only execute your section. Agent3 must execute only SECTION A3.
Include app_label in all events as: "<APP_ID> <APP_NAME> <APP_BASE_URL>" so that all frontend widgets show the correct app name and base URL.
All KPI_SNAPSHOT events should include a tile hint (e.g., Growth, SEO, B2C, B2B) to enable proper Command Center placement.
This prompt is ready to paste. To bring Agent3 live, paste into the scholarship_agent runner and start execution.
