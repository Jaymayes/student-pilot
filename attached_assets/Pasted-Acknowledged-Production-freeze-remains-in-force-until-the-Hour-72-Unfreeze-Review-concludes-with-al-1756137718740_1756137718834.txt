Acknowledged. Production freeze remains in force until the Hour 72 Unfreeze Review concludes with all must‑pass criteria met.

Final executive guidance before Hour 72

What I expect in the pre‑read (due 2 hours before review)

QA/Sec
The full rerun of qa-comprehensive-execution-report.json
Delta summary: which issues closed; tests added; what remains Medium/Low with owners and ETAs
Canary validation checklist
Secret-scan evidence for repo and built assets showing 0 findings
Backend/Frontend
Test IDs and logs for: auth protection on /api/billing/balance; SSR 200/404; SQL injection negative tests; fault‑injection results for async error handling
Confirmation that logs show PII redaction in place across auth, billing, profile, and file upload paths
DevOps/Data
CI gate outputs (eval ban, SQL concat ban, secret scans passing)
Live dashboard links: auth abuse, reconciliation deltas, endpoint contract health, SSR error rate, p95 latency, error budget
Redis rate‑limiter metrics (blocked attempts, false positives)
Billing/Finance
24‑hour reconciliation report with $0 deltas; idempotency evidence
Green/Yellow/Red thresholds for the review

Green (Go): All must‑pass checks green; guardrails stable; no open Critical/High; secret scans clean; SLOs within bounds
Yellow (CEO judgment call): Only rate‑limit false positives between 0.5–1.0% with a 24‑hour mitigation plan, no other deviations
Red (No‑Go): Any secret finding, auth bypass, reconciliation deltas > $0, or guardrail breach without immediate root cause and rollback
Residual risk categories to address in the review (top 3 expected)

Rate limiting false positives impacting legitimate users
Mitigation: temporary higher thresholds for known partner ranges; support override workflow; 24‑hour tuning plan
Compiled asset scan false positives
Mitigation: still rotate; treat as exposure until cleared; maintain CDN purge and monitoring
Query refactor regressions
Mitigation: feature flags; canary at 10% for 2 hours; auto‑rollback on p95/5xx breach
Post‑unfreeze success criteria and 24‑hour targets

Security and integrity
PII redaction violations: 0
Blocked auth abuse attempts: tracked and reported; false positives ≤0.5% (or an approved plan within 24 hours)
Billing reconciliation deltas: $0; idempotency failures: 0
Reliability
Uptime ≥99.9%; p95 latency within ±10% of baseline
SSR error rate: no spikes; endpoint contract health 100% for public/protected routes
Process
CI gates remain mandatory; no merges to main that fail any security or type gates
Communications and on‑call

War room: opens 30 minutes before review; remains live through the 8‑hour ramp
On‑call: confirm primary/secondary (Backend, DevOps, DB, Security)
Communications kit: prepare internal release notes, status page template, and a brief partner/stakeholder assurance note (send only after Go)
Immediate plan after a Go decision

Traffic ramp: 10% (2 hours) → 50% (4 hours) → 100% if guardrails hold
First deployments (behind flags, in this order):
Pricing/onboarding experiments with entitlement checks
Provider Portal MVP slices for pilot partners
SEO instrumentation and CWV beacons on key templates
24‑hour after‑action review: capture root causes, time‑to‑fix, and permanent controls (keep eval/SQL‑concat bans, secret scanning, PII‑log gates; add training and a short secure‑SQL coding standard)
Escalation

If any must‑pass is at risk by Hour 60, escalate in the exec channel with options and impact. Do not wait for the meeting.
Stay disciplined. Quality over speed remains our rule until we clear the bar. I will chair the Hour 72 Unfreeze Review.
