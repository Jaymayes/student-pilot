Read-Only Readiness Audit — ScholarshipAI Student Pilot

Context

Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Strict read-only diagnostic. Do not modify any settings, data, content, campaigns, indexes, or integrations. Do not send emails/messages, trigger jobs, or re-run pipelines. No external web calls; use only existing internal telemetry, logs, and stored reports. If data is missing, mark as UNKNOWN and recommend minimal instrumentation to close the gap.
Objective
Assess go-live readiness against the 5-year plan toward $10M profitable ARR and market leadership. Produce an executive summary and a structured diagnostic with explicit PASS/WARN/FAIL judgments, each tied to evidence (dashboard/report names, log IDs, timestamps).

Scope and required checks

B2C funnel (students)
Last 28d and 90d: MAUs, new signups, activation rate, free→paid conversion, ARPU from credit sales, churn, LTV, CAC by channel.
SEO/Auto Page Maker performance: impressions, clicks, CTR, index coverage, top landing pages, Core Web Vitals (LCP/FID/CLS) from stored reports, schema/structured data status.
Value metrics: time-to-first-quality match (median, P90), application completion rate, CSAT/NPS, refund/chargeback rate.
Compare to plan targets; variance thresholds: >10% = WARN, >20% = FAIL.
2. Product/SLOs for the student-pilot app

Uptime last 30/90d (target ≥99.9%), P95 latency (target ~120ms), error rate, top 3 incidents, mean time to recovery.
Data quality: duplicate/invalid scholarships, stale listings, broken links, success rate of match/ranking jobs.
Observability: alert coverage, paging policy, unresolved P1/P2 issues.
Endpoint health (read-only checks only): GET /health, /status, /robots.txt, /sitemap.xml, /.well-known/security.txt; record status codes and latency from existing logs only.
3. Financial and unit economics

Current MRR/ARR split B2C vs B2B, gross margin with explicit AI COGS; confirm 4x markup target by segment.
Cash burn, runway, CAC payback by cohort, net revenue retention; top 3 variance-to-plan drivers.
Monetization readiness: credit pricing, payment rails configured, payout accuracy (read from prior test logs only).
4. Compliance, security, Responsible AI

FERPA/COPPA posture: consent flows, data retention, DPA/ToS coverage, access controls, audit log anomalies.
Responsible AI: bias audit results for matching/recommendations, model cards/explanations, safeguards against academic dishonesty, last red-team findings and remediations.
Privacy/security: encryption at rest/in transit, key management, third-party risk, last pen-test summary.
5. SEO machine (Auto Page Maker)

Page inventory, indexation rate, canonicalization, sitemap health, crawl budget utilization, duplicate/thin content detection, internal linking, backlink highlights (from stored SEO reports).
Top 10 pages by traffic and conversions; blockers to scaling.
6. Marketing engine (Scholarship Agent)

Campaign configurations, guardrails, approval states, content library QA. Confirm all autonomous actions are in paused/dry-run state for this audit.
7. Risk register and readiness decision

Top 10 strategic/operational risks with likelihood, impact, owner, mitigation status.
Readiness decision: Green/Yellow/Red with justification. List critical blockers, owners, effort, and ETA.
Output format

Executive summary: 6–10 bullets and a clear go/no-go recommendation.
KPI dashboard table: rows for each KPI with Current, Target, Variance%, Status (PASS/WARN/FAIL).
Endpoint health table: endpoint, last-seen status code, last-seen P95 latency, last error (if any), log ID.
Evidence: link or ID to each dashboard/report/log used.

Safety constraints

Do not mutate data or configuration. Do not send emails, payments, or notifications. Do not trigger background jobs, reindexing, migrations, or cache clears. Use only existing telemetry and stored reports. If a required metric is unavailable, return UNKNOWN with the minimal instrumentation required to measure it.
