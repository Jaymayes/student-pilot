Conditional scale: Pre-approved to raise the cap to $400/day on Day 4, pending Day-3 T+24h confirmation that all scale gates remain green (CAC ≤ $7, ARPU7:CAC ≥ 2.0x, Refunds ≤ 3%, Stripe ≥ 98.5%, Incidents = 0).
Experiments: Roll out “First-Upload UX” and “Credit Pack Framing” to 100% immediately. This aligns with Playbook V2.0’s directive to make “first document upload” the primary activation, and to fuse Essay Coach value into core flows to improve implicit-fit matching .
Operational orders (owners as proposed)

Growth: Implement 100% rollouts now; have Day 4 campaigns staged for instant activation upon the T+24h green light.
Sales: Run a 48h “white glove” sprint to close the 3-provider gap; prioritize checkout-abandoners.
Finance/Ops: Verify gates at 06:00; if green, lift to $400 with throttles and SLO guardrails active.
