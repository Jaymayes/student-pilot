CEO Executive Directive — Final Integration, Go/No-Go, and ARR Guardrails

Prime directive alignment

We proceed only when the gates are green: deliverability GREEN before any broadcast, Stripe PASS before any payment, issuer correctness and performance SLOs enforced. This preserves brand trust and supports our low-CAC flywheel led by organic SEO to reach $10M+ ARR, as laid out in our Playbook V2.0 (SEO-first growth and activation focus) and the B2B-led revenue shift based on Year 1 actuals .
Executive decisions and gates

Go/No-Go posture today: Maintain change freeze across apps; permit config-only auth issuer switch in the Nov 9 window; no email broadcasts without deliverability GREEN; no payments before Stripe PASS. This balances execution speed with evidence-based reliability and security, consistent with our production-grade standards for distributed apps on Replit and our security governance playbooks .
Growth engine posture: Auto Page Maker remains frozen, monitor-only. Organic acquisition continues compounding per the Playbook’s SEO-led growth model; KPI rollups only (indexation ≥95%, CWV p75 GREEN, zero publishing errors) .
Activation focus: All student experience work stays aligned to “First Document Upload” as the primary activation lever for B2C conversion and value creation; this is the highest-leverage user action to drive downstream revenue and engagement .
Revenue mix: Near-term revenue emphasis remains B2B; B2C monetization continues as a power-user upsell track while we scale the marketplace and partner toolkit per roadmap and ACV performance data .
Critical path, owners, and deadlines

auto_com_center — Deliverability (Owner: auto_com_center DRI)
Decision: Proceed with Option A — mail.scholaraiadvisor.com on Postmark.
Immediate blocker: DNS admin access for scholaraiadvisor.com (Cloudflare vs. registrar). Provide DNS admin contact now.
Required by T+45/T+90 from acknowledgment:
T+45: DNS + ESP configuration complete (SPF, DKIM). Evidence: DNS screenshots, Postmark verification.
T+90: GREEN certification. Evidence: seed inbox placement (Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo/Proton/iCloud), bounce-rate check, spam score.
Success criteria to declare GREEN: ≥90% inbox placement across seeds, valid SPF/DKIM, DMARC aligned, no critical blocklists. No broadcasts until GREEN.
2. Platform Ops — Auth domain and infrastructure (Owner: Platform Ops lead)

Action: Provision Cloudflare for auth.scholaraiadvisor.com and deploy Workers per template; file Replit P1 if infra interception persists. Evidence required: DNS records, curl traces, headers/issuer correctness.
Deadline: Tonight 20:15 UTC evidence checkpoint.
Rationale: Strong, observable auth is foundational to our distributed architecture and SLO compliance on Replit .
3. Finance/Platform Ops — Stripe escalation (Owner: Finance lead)

Action: File Stripe Priority Support (budget approved) and post case ID + ETA.
Deadline: 21:00 UTC.
Gate: No payments, pricing tests, or provider charges until Stripe PASS.
4. provider_register — Waitlist gate (Owner: provider_register DRI)

Action: Enable ENABLE_WAITLIST_MODE=true. Collect 10 request_id samples; verify health 200 OK and error rate ≤0.1%.
Deadlines: T+15 for activation, T+40 for evidence.
Gate: B2B ARR ignition earliest Nov 10 01:30–03:00 UTC only after Stripe PASS + Auth GREEN TAG.
5. student_pilot — E2E harness post-cutover (Owner: student_pilot DRI)

Action: Maintain frozen posture; participate in Nov 9 pre-soak; deliver T+30 evidence: PKCE S256 with https://auth.scholaraiadvisor.com, profile CRUD via scholarship_api, scholarship_sage interaction, request_id lineage, P50/P95, error rates ≤0.1% .
Per-application Go/No-Go and orders

scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: Go for Nov 9 config-only issuer switch; blocked on Cloudflare/infra for final issuer/header conformance. SLOs and security headers mandatory. Evidence: JWKS/discovery, cache headers, revocation behavior. Owner: Platform Ops + auth DRI.

scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: Frozen; participate in Nov 9 pre-soak. Deliver P50/P95, 401/5xx handling, revocation checks, PKCE/M2M conformance. Maintain ≤120ms P95 target and ≤0.1% error rate per platform standards .

scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: Frozen, observe-only through Nov 12; fairness telemetry daily at 12:00 UTC. No auto-apply without explicit consent; aligns with Responsible AI guardrails.

scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: Frozen; Nov 9 M2M issuer switch and read-only scopes enforced. Pre-soak evidence: latency, scopes, request_id lineage.

student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: Frozen; Nov 9 pre-soak + T+30 E2E bundle.

provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: Enable waitlist now; evidence per above. Conversion messaging deferred until deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS.

auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: Frozen; monitor-only. KPI rollups at 06:00 UTC: indexation ≥95%, CWV p75 GREEN, zero publishing errors. This protects our low-CAC acquisition engine per Playbook priorities  .

auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: Execute deliverability Option A upon DNS access; produce GREEN certification with evidence bundle.

ARR ignition windows and conditions

B2B earliest: Nov 10, 01:30–03:00 UTC Conditions: Stripe PASS + Auth GREEN TAG; waitlist continues in the interim. This aligns with our Year 2 emphasis on B2B acceleration and higher ACV reality vs. original assumptions .
B2C earliest: Nov 11, 00:00 UTC Conditions: Auth GREEN TAG + pre-soak PASS + deliverability GREEN; continue to optimize for “First Document Upload” activation in UX and messaging .
Open blockers requiring immediate resolution

DNS admin for scholaraiadvisor.com: Provide owner and access path now (Cloudflare or registrar). This is the critical path for deliverability GREEN within tonight’s T+90 window.
Stripe escalation: Provide case ID and ETA by 21:00 UTC.
Cloudflare provisioning and Replit P1: Provide evidence by 20:15 UTC.
Risk controls and evidence hygiene

Maintain request_id lineage end-to-end across Cloudflare → origin for auth/api calls; verify 401/5xx handling and revocation behavior during pre-soak. This is essential for production-grade reliability on Replit and consistent with our resilience patterns and SLOs .
Responsible AI: scholarship_agent remains observe-only; fairness telemetry continues daily; no academic dishonesty enablement.
Executive asks — respond immediately

Provide DNS admin contact and confirm DNS host (Cloudflare vs. registrar).
Confirm Stripe case submission and share case ID + ETA.
Confirm provider_register waitlist flag enabled; post evidence timestamps.
I will hold gates until evidence meets thresholds. This is how we protect the brand, keep our SEO-led low-CAC engine compounding, and hit the $10M+ ARR trajectory with B2B as the near-term revenue driver and B2C as an activation-optimized upsell track per Playbook V2.0  .
