Acknowledged. As CEO, here is the executive integration decision and directive for Operation Synergy.

Executive summary

Goal: Full Operational Capability across the ecosystem with one identity issuer, one source of truth, standardized security, and ≤120ms P95 latency.
Current state: 5 apps READY, 2 apps NOT READY due to auth configuration and client registration, and 1 app requires DRY-RUN scale validation.
Go/No-Go: No-Go for FOC until two P0 auth blockers are cleared. Target to greenlight within the same business day if actions below are executed immediately.
Readiness by application

scholar_auth (Infrastructure): READY with two minor T+4h items noted (CORS allowlist hardening; log guardrails middleware integration). Sole OIDC issuer. JWKS operational. Action: complete two hardening items after FOC greenlight to avoid churn.
scholarship_api (Infrastructure): READY. RBAC middleware, standardized errors, indexes, P95 ~93ms. Sole OIDC issuer respected.
scholarship_sage (Intelligence): READY. /recommendations endpoint stable, P95 ~1ms, JWT/JWKS integration with scholar_auth.
scholarship_agent (Intelligence/Automation): READY pending DRY-RUN of event throughput with auto_com_center. Circuit breakers, M2M flow, event catalog complete.
auto_page_maker (Intelligence/Automation): READY. 2,101 generated pages, sitemap and IndexNow enabled, schema.org coverage. Recommend DRY-RUN validation (search console, 10-page content audit, funnel check).
auto_com_center (Infrastructure/Comms): Requires DRY-RUN at 5× expected load to validate queue durability and delivery integrations (email/SMS). If DRY-RUN passes, mark READY.
provider_register (User Facing): NOT READY (P0). Blocked on AUTH_ISSUER_URL secret pointing to dev, and OIDC client registration.
student_pilot (User Facing): NOT READY (P0). Blocked on OIDC client registration and secret rotation.
Mandatory corrective actions (critical path)
Execute these in order; owners and SLAs included.

Register OIDC clients in scholar_auth (Owner: Auth DRI; SLA: T+60 minutes)
Clients: student-pilot, provider-register
Grant types: authorization_code + refresh_token (PKCE S256)
Scopes: openid email profile roles offline_access
Redirect URIs:
student-pilot: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/callback
provider-register: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/auth/callback
Rotate secrets; update via Replit Secrets only; invalidate any issued refresh tokens since compromise markers.
2. Update misconfigured issuer secret (Owner: Operator; SLA: T+15 minutes)

Replit Secret AUTH_ISSUER_URL for provider_register → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Restart service after update.
3. Smoke test auth round-trips (Owner: Frontend DRI; SLA: T+30 minutes after step 1-2)

Validate login → callback → refresh token rotation (one student; one provider)
Acceptance: 2/2 success, 0 errors, tokens present as HttpOnly, Secure cookies.
4. Gate 3 E2E runs (Owner: Frontend DRI; SLA: T+90 minutes)

Student-pilot: 30-sample run; measure auth success ≥98%, P95 ≤120ms across top 5 API calls; Lighthouse Accessibility ≥90; zero critical 5xx.
Provider-register: 30-sample RBAC isolation run after auth GREEN; org-scoped access only; zero cross-tenant leakage.
5. auto_com_center DRY-RUN (Owner: Comms DRI; SLA: T+60 minutes in parallel with E2E)

Push 5× peak event volume; verify queue durability, retries, and unsubscribe compliance.
Acceptance: ≥99% delivery success, no dead-letter backlog growth, opt-out honored.
6. SEO DRY-RUN (Owner: Growth DRI; SLA: T+24 hours, non-blocking to FOC)

Verify sitemap, IndexNow, random 10-page quality audit, and CTA → student signup funnel.
Go/No-Go decision criteria

Go when:
Two P0 auth blockers cleared and smoke tests pass.
E2E: auth success ≥98%, P95 ≤120ms, 0 critical 5xx, RBAC isolation 100%.
auto_com_center DRY-RUN ≥99% delivery success with no DLQ growth.
No-Go if any criterion fails or cross-tenant data access is observed.
Risk register and mitigations

Auth configuration drift (HIGH): Lock secrets in Replit Secrets; enable startup config validation that hard-fails on dev issuer.
Cross-tenant leakage (CRITICAL): Enforce org-scoped filters at repository layer; add unit tests and E2E assertions before release.
Queue saturation (MEDIUM): Confirm back-pressure and retry policies in DRY-RUN; pre-provision capacity.
SEO index volatility (LOW, non-blocking): Monitor Search Console; roll incremental template improvements.
Lifecycle and revenue cessation horizon

Infrastructure (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center): 5–7 years. Watch for OAuth 2.1/3.0 shifts, PQC, and scale thresholds.
User Facing (student_pilot, provider_register): 3–4 years. Plan major UX refresh aligned to WCAG 3.0 and AI-first interaction norms.
Intelligence/Automation (scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker): 2–3 years. Budget for ongoing model/logic upgrades to maintain differentiation.
KPIs tied to $10M ARR plan

B2C funnel: auth success ≥98%, P95 ≤120ms, conversion lift from sage-driven recommendations; Stripe test mode validated and ready for prod keys.
B2B engine: provider_register live with frictionless onboarding; 3% platform fee disclosure present; RBAC isolation proven.
CAC: Prioritize Auto Page Maker organic growth engine; DRY-RUN and Search Console verification to accelerate indexing.
Profitability: Maintain 4× markup on AI services and 3% provider fee; ensure queue/process costs scale efficiently with volume.
Immediate asks from me (CEO)

Auth DRI: Confirm client registrations and secret rotations complete within 60 minutes. Post one successful student and one provider auth round-trip log summary.
Operator: Update provider_register AUTH_ISSUER_URL secret to production issuer now and restart the service.
Frontend DRI: Begin 30-sample E2E as soon as you receive the GREEN from Auth; submit evidence bundle upon completion.
Comms DRI: Execute auto_com_center 5× DRY-RUN and report delivery metrics and DLQ status.
Decision

Current: No-Go for FOC until P0 auth items are resolved. With the actions above executed promptly, we can shift to Go the same day and enter the FOC window with confidence.
Reply here when steps 1 and 2 are completed; I will authorize the E2E and DRY-RUN windows immediately.
