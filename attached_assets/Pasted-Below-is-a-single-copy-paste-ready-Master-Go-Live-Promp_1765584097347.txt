Below is a single, copy-paste-ready Master Go‑Live Prompt (v3.3.1) that you can drop into any app. It contains sections for A1–A8 and one detailed, executable section for A3 scholarship_agent. Critical rule: each app must only execute the section explicitly labeled for that app. All other sections are for reference/context and MUST be ignored by that app.

MASTER GO-LIVE PROMPT v3.3.1 (Fleet-Wide)
Purpose

Bring all apps online, start generating B2C/B2B leads, and stream telemetry to the Command Center (A8) with frontend dashboard display enabled.
This document combines instructions for all apps. Each app must execute only its own section.
All reports/events MUST include app_name and app_base_url to avoid confusion.
Agent3 (scholarship_agent) has the only executable section in this prompt when run inside A3.
App Directory (IDs and Base URLs)

A1 scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A2 scholarship_api → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A3 scholarship_agent → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A4 scholarship_sage → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A5 student_pilot → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A6 provider_register → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A7 auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A8 auto_com_center (Command Center) → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Global Rules (apply to all apps)

Execute only the section that names your app ID. Ignore all other sections.
Identify yourself before any action:
Print to logs: “APP_IDENTITY: <app_id> <app_name> <app_base_url> protocol=v3.3.1”
Immediately emit APP_ONLINE to A8 (and A2 as fallback if needed).
Telemetry protocol v3.3.1
Primary ingest: POST https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/ingest
Fallback ingest: POST https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/analytics/events (primary fallback), or POST /api/events (legacy)
Required headers: Content-Type: application/json; X-Protocol-Version: v3.3.1; X-Idempotency-Key: <uuid>
Required fields in every event: event_type, app_name, app_base_url, timestamp (UTC ISO-8601), message, metadata (no PII)
Retries: 3 attempts with exponential backoff. If A8 returns non-2xx or >2s timeout, route to A2 with the exact same X-Idempotency-Key.
SLO targets (informational, enforced by A8):
Availability ≥99.9%, P95 latency ≈120ms, strict privacy (no PII in telemetry).
Dashboard display
Set metadata.dashboard = true for KPI_SNAPSHOT and conversion events you want shown on A8’s frontend tiles.
Event-to-widget mapping used by A8:
LEAD_PROVIDER_RECEIVED → CONVERSION → leads, b2b_funnel
PROVIDER_ONBOARDED → CONVERSION → b2b_funnel, conversions
REC_DELIVERED → PRODUCT → recommendations, engagement
PAGE_PUBLISHED → PRODUCT → seo, content
CTA_EMITTED → TRAFFIC → traffic, engagement
Event Types (baseline set)

APP_ONLINE, PREFLIGHT_CHECK, HEARTBEAT, KPI_SNAPSHOT, ERROR
LEAD_STUDENT, LEAD_PROVIDER_RECEIVED, PROVIDER_ONBOARDED, REC_DELIVERED, PAGE_PUBLISHED, CTA_EMITTED
SECTION A3 ONLY — scholarship_agent (Executable)
App Identity for all reports

app_name: scholarship_agent
app_base_url: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
0. Self-Identification (required)

Log: “APP_IDENTITY: A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app protocol=v3.3.1”
Emit APP_ONLINE:
event_type: APP_ONLINE
message: “A3 online and orchestrator ready”
metadata:
role: “orchestrator”
dep_mode: “prod”
ingestion_primary: “A8”
ingestion_fallback: “A2”
version: “v3.3.1”
dashboard: true
PREFLIGHT_CHECK (dependency matrix + go/no-go)
Probe the following health/SLO endpoints:
A1: GET https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/health
A2: GET https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/health
A4: GET https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/health and GET /api/slo/status
A5: GET https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/health
A6: GET https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/health
A7: GET https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/health
A8: GET https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/health
Compute status_matrix with “ok” or “down” per app. Include key SLO fields for A4 if available (p95_ms, error_rate, slo_overall).
Decide routing:
If A6 is up: metadata.route_provider_leads = “active”
If A6 is down >10 minutes: metadata.route_provider_leads = “queue”
Emit PREFLIGHT_CHECK:
event_type: PREFLIGHT_CHECK
message: “A3 preflight complete”
metadata:
status_matrix: { “A1”: “…”, “A2”: “…”, … “A8”: “…” }
slo_overall: “green|yellow|red” (based on A4 and any critical deps)
go_live: “go” if all critical deps green; else “hold”
route_provider_leads: “active|queue”
dashboard: true
If go_live != “go”, continue HEARTBEATs, raise ERROR, and retry preflight every 60s until “go”.
2. Runbook: Start Lead Generation Orchestration (upon go_live = “go”)

SEO traffic activation with A7 (passive listen; no control commands issued from A3):
Expect PAGE_PUBLISHED events from A7; do not act on them except for attribution in KPI_SNAPSHOT.
Student B2C funnel (A5 + A4):
When a user triggers any CTA on landing pages (from A5 or A7 surfaces), record CTA_EMITTED.
Emit CTA_EMITTED with metadata: { surface: “seo|landing|inproduct”, cta_id, page_slug, dashboard: true }
Direct the user into A5 student_pilot lead capture flow (no PII in telemetry).
On successful lead capture (non-PII confirmation):
Emit LEAD_STUDENT with metadata: { source: “organic_seo|landing|inproduct”, consent_version, target_app: “A5”, dashboard: true }
Recommendation loop with A4 (non-PII request):
POST https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/v1/recommendations/outline
Example minimal body: { academic_level: “undergrad”, field: “cs”, timeline: “fall” } (do NOT include PII)
On successful delivery:
Emit REC_DELIVERED with metadata: { count, context: “onpage|email|inproduct”, conversion_proxy: “cta_click”, dashboard: true }
Provider B2B funnel (A6 handoff):
When a provider lead is received or triggered via CTA or outreach, emit LEAD_PROVIDER_RECEIVED with metadata: { source: “organic|referral|direct”, dashboard: true }
POST handoff to A6: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/providers/register
On any 2xx from A6, emit PROVIDER_ONBOARDED with metadata: { provider_id_hash, plan:“free|paid”, dashboard: true }
If A6 is unavailable and route_provider_leads = “queue”, persist to internal queue with retry policy; do not lose leads.
3. HEARTBEAT (every 60s)

Emit HEARTBEAT:
event_type: HEARTBEAT
message: “A3 heartbeat”
metadata:
health: “ok|degraded”
p95_ms
running_jobs
queue_depth
last_successful_ingest_ts
dashboard: false
4. KPI_SNAPSHOT (every 5 minutes; dashboard=true)

Emit KPI_SNAPSHOT:
event_type: KPI_SNAPSHOT
message: “A3 KPIs (5m)”
metadata:
metric_name: “a3_kpi_snapshot”
traffic_5m
leads_student_5m
leads_provider_5m
ctr_cta_5m
recs_delivered_5m
dashboard: true
5. Error Handling and Degrade Modes

On any failure in orchestration, emit ERROR with metadata: { error_code, severity:“low|med|high”, context, last_action, dashboard:false }
A8 ingest non-2xx or timeout:
Retry 3x with backoff, then send the same payload to A2 /api/analytics/events preserving X-Idempotency-Key.
If A6 down >10m, set route_provider_leads = “queue” and persist handoffs locally. Retry every 60s; on success flip to “active”.
6. Privacy, Security, Compliance

No PII in telemetry fields. Use hashed IDs where needed (e.g., provider_id_hash).
Respect consent_version on LEAD_STUDENT. Only non-PII recommendations requests to A4.
Ensure app_name and app_base_url are included in every event.
7. Exit Criteria for Go-Live (success markers)

APP_ONLINE and PREFLIGHT_CHECK accepted by A8 (2xx).
Initial HEARTBEAT and first KPI_SNAPSHOT visible on A8 dashboard.
At least one CTA_EMITTED, one LEAD_STUDENT, one REC_DELIVERED recorded.
If applicable, one LEAD_PROVIDER_RECEIVED and PROVIDER_ONBOARDED recorded.

Final Notes

Every event must include app_name and app_base_url exactly as listed in the App Directory.
All telemetry must be non-PII. Use hashed IDs if you need correlation.
If you are Agent3, run only the A3 section above. All other sections are strictly for reference/context.
