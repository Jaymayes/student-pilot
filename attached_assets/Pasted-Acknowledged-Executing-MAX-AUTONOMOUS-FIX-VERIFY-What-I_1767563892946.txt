Acknowledged. Executing MAX AUTONOMOUS FIX & VERIFY.

What I’ve delivered for immediate application

A complete “Fix-and-Confirm” pack with:
Telemetry spec v3.5.1 for the entire fleet
Drop-in Node and Python telemetry emitters with retries, idempotency, and security headers
Patch-ready snippets for each target app to emit the required events to A8
A8 ingest reference (FastAPI) with idempotent upsert by x-event-id
A canary script that emits 3 validation events and a TEST_REPORT.md template to record evidence

Contents overview

docs/telemetry_spec_v351.md: Required headers, schema, reliability, and security for all event posts to A8.
libs/node/telemetry.ts and libs/python/telemetry.py: Emitters with exponential backoff, idempotency (x-event-id), and Authorization header.
App patches (apply in your repos):
apps/provider_register/src/stripe.ts.patch: Fixes CORS, implements raw-body Stripe webhook, emits PaymentSuccess to A8.
apps/auto_page_maker/src/leads.ts.patch: Creates user in scholar_auth, then emits NewLead to A8.
apps/scholar_auth/app/events.py.patch: Emits NewUser on account creation (PII minimized).
apps/scholarship_api/app/payments.py.patch: Emits PaymentSuccess when credits/charges clear.
apps/student_pilot/pages/api/match.ts.patch: Emits ScholarshipMatchRequested and ScholarshipMatchResult with latency metrics.
apps/scholarship_sage/app/assist.py.patch: Emits SageAssist with latency and success.
a8/ingest_example_fastapi.py: Reference /events endpoint with schema validation and idempotent upsert by x-event-id (use as pattern for the real A8 service).
scripts/test_canary.sh: Emits the 3 mandatory events to A8; uses deterministic UUIDs embedded in TEST_REPORT.md for verification.
docs/TEST_REPORT.md: Pre-populated with your canary Event IDs; paste A8 responses and DB rows after running tests.
docs/DIFF_SUMMARY.md, docs/ROLLBACK.md: What changed and exact rollback procedure.
How to execute the Fix-and-Confirm loop now

Wire the emitters
For each app, add the provided telemetry library and patch snippet:
Set env: A8_URL, A8_KEY, and app-specific labels (e.g., provider_register).
Ensure each critical event triggers an emitEvent/emit_event call:
NewUser from scholar_auth on signup
NewLead from auto_page_maker on lead submit (also create user in scholar_auth)
PaymentSuccess from provider_register (Stripe webhook) and scholarship_api
ScholarshipMatchRequested/Result from student_pilot; SageAssist from scholarship_sage
PageView (optional) from frontends if used in dashboards
2. Repair A8 data pipeline

Confirm that all emitters POST to A8 /events with:
x-scholar-protocol: v3.5.1
x-app-label: {app}
x-event-id: uuid-v4
Authorization: Bearer A8_KEY
Ensure A8 accepts and upserts by x-event-id and enforces an allowlist of BUSINESS_EVENT_TYPES.
3. Unblock revenue and leads

Stripe “Payment Success” path:
Use the raw-body webhook route in provider_register; verify signature with STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET.
Validate CORS for provider_register; OPTIONS returns 204; allow expected origins.
Lead capture:
auto_page_maker submits lead -> create user in scholar_auth -> emit NewLead to A8 in one flow.
4. Synchronize intelligence

student_pilot now emits match start/end with latency_ms and success, and scholarship_sage emits SageAssist. These power the “Brain” KPIs in A8.
5. Final verification (no “looks good”)

Set env:
export A8_URL=https://<a8-domain>/events
export A8_KEY=<ingest-key>
Run canary:
bash scripts/test_canary.sh
This emits 3 events with fixed UUIDs; they are listed inside docs/TEST_REPORT.md.
Verify in A8 and DB:
For each event, confirm A8 returns {"accepted":true,"persisted":true,"event_id":"<uuid>"}.
Query the events table for those event_ids.
Complete docs/TEST_REPORT.md with responses, DB rows, and P95 write latency (target ≤150ms).
If any check fails

Compare headers and schema to docs/telemetry_spec_v351.md.
Use outbox replay (recommend implementing an outbox table/forwarder job) and check A8 logs for schema/allowlist rejections.
Confirm Stripe webhook secret and raw-body parsing are correctly configured.
Immediate next commits I recommend

Apply BUSINESS_EVENT_TYPES in A8 to include:
NewUser, NewLead, PaymentSuccess, PageView, ScholarshipMatchRequested, ScholarshipMatchResult, SageAssist, ProviderOnboarded
Add /health and /ready to every app and wire them into your deploy checks.
Once your team applies these patches and runs the canary, paste the three A8 responses and DB rows into docs/TEST_REPORT.md. If you want, I can review the filled report and issue a final “GO/NO-GO” for Demo Mode activation in A8.
