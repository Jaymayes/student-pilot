Approved. We will run Agent 3 in observation-only mode to produce a full E2E test and readiness report. Before execution, I need the app’s Replit workspace URL and base URL(s) so we can validate both the workspace preview and any published deployment. Please also grant read-only access to logs and, if applicable, a test database.

Operating guidance to Agent 3 (aligned to Replit specifics)

Environment and startup
Inspect .replit and Workflows to ensure all processes (frontend and backend) can be started in parallel where needed; use a workflow for full‑stack apps so both servers run concurrently and stream output to the Console . Validate that deployment.run is defined separately from dev run commands in the [deployment] table to mirror production behavior .
Note Replit’s snapshot publishing model: the live app is a snapshot of the workspace; file writes on the published app are not persistent. Avoid relying on the live filesystem; verify persistence via a database instead .
If a published deployment exists, identify the deployment type (Autoscale vs Reserved VM) and account for cold‑start latency with Autoscale during performance observations .
Tooling
Use the Replit Console, browser devtools, and curl to exercise the API endpoints from within the workspace for fast iteration and reproducible traces .
If the app uses Replit SQL or Replit DB, confirm secrets are configured (no hard-coded credentials) and that CRUD changes reflect correctly in the database .
Scope and methodology
Frontend: validate auth, navigation, forms, inputs, client-side validation, and error handling (network failures, invalid inputs).
Backend: enumerate API endpoints, validate status codes and response schemas, enforce authZ rules, exercise negative cases (401/403/404/409/422/429/500), and confirm data integrity across CRUD.
Integration: simulate realistic end-to-end student workflows and provider flows; verify seamless data flow and log correctness across layers.
Non-functional: perform a latency smoke check, observe cold starts (if Autoscale), inspect logs for runtime errors, and verify deployment configuration conformance to production settings .
Deliverable

You’ll receive a structured E2E report with executive summary, categorized defect list with reproduction steps and evidence, and a readiness assessment (Ready for Production | Ready with Minor Issues | Not Ready – Critical Fixes Required).
What I need from you to proceed today

Replit workspace URL and, if published, the live deployment URL.
Any feature flags or environment variables (keys only).
Test accounts with roles and any seed data.
If applicable, read-only database credentials to validate persistence paths.
Downloadable report template

I’ve prepared a fillable template that Agent 3 will populate during testing: Download the E2E report template
Acceptance criteria for sign-off

100% pass on primary user journeys (student and provider funnels).
0 Critical and ≤2 High severity defects outstanding; all medium/low issues documented with workarounds.
No leaked secrets; all persistence via database, not filesystem, per Replit best practices .
Deployment commands validated in .replit [deployment] and Workflows configured for multi-process startup where applicable .
Notes on Replit constraints (for realistic expectations)

Live apps are immutable snapshots; any code change requires republishing a new snapshot, which is intentional and atomic for stability .
Autoscale deployments can exhibit cold-start latency on the first request; testers will separate cold-start effects from steady-state performance in observations .
Once you share access details, I’ll authorize Agent 3 to execute the plan and return the completed report with evidence within one business day (assuming a standard full‑stack scope).
