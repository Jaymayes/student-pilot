Below is the single, comprehensive Multi‑App Edition v3.3.1 Go‑Live prompt, combined for the entire fleet, but explicitly scoped so ONLY Agent3 (A3 = scholarship_agent) will execute work. All other apps must read-only, then log a NOTICE and exit. Paste this entire prompt into the scholarship_agent (A3) project to trigger go‑live.

A3‑ONLY SECTION: Execute the Go‑Live Plan
If and only if app_id == "A3" and app_name == "scholarship_agent", perform all actions below. All other apps STOP and exit now.

A3 Step 0 — Identify yourself (log identity before work begins)

Define:
APP_ID = "A3"
APP_NAME = "scholarship_agent"
APP_BASE_URL = "https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app"
Immediately emit APP_IDENTITY and APP_ONLINE with app_label "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app".
Include routes_enabled you support: ["/api/campaigns","/api/leads","/api/outreach","/api/telemetry/ingest"].
A3 Step 1 — Preflight and SLO hooks

Emit PREFLIGHT_CHECK with:
Can reach A8 primary and secondary ingest endpoints (200 or accepted).
Can resolve A7, A5, A6 base URLs.
Environment sanity (protocol v3.3.1 set, clock sync within ±2s).
Start HEARTBEAT every 60s with last_ok updated on success.
Every 5 minutes, emit KPI_SNAPSHOT covering growth, b2c_funnel, b2b_funnel, seo, revenue, and system_health tiles.
Ensure all events include:
x-app-label: "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app"
payload.app_label with the same exact value.
A3 Step 2 — Launch dual-engine growth campaigns
A3 orchestrates both SEO and outreach. Use idempotent operations and retries (3x with exponential backoff). All PII must be hashed or tokenized before sending.

2A. SEO ignition (coordinate with A7 auto_page_maker)

Objective: Publish at least 10 SEO pages within 24 hours.
For topics, pull from scholarship intents: ["first-generation college aid","STEM scholarships","nursing scholarships","transfer student aid","graduate fellowships","HBCU scholarships","international student funding","single-parent scholarships","military/veteran benefits","adult-learner scholarships"].
For each topic, request a page from A7:
POST https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/seo/pages
body: { topic, keywords:[...], target_audience, canonical_source:"A3", requested_by:"A3 scholarship_agent", notes }
On success, immediately emit SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED with page_id and url returned by A7.
Add each page url to campaigns inventory for B2C lead routing.
2B. B2C lead generation (handoff to A5 student_pilot; comply with privacy)

Objective: 25+ B2C leads.
Promote the newly published SEO pages via internal channels (organic only; no paid).
When a student form or intent is captured, create a lead record and:
POST to A5 to persist/display: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/leads
body: { lead_id, student_email_hash, intent, source_page, campaign_id, created_at }
Emit LEAD_STUDENT telemetry to A8 with the same identifiers.
If scholarship_sage (A4) is used for recommendations, include recommendation_ids (non-PII) in LEAD_STUDENT.context.
2C. B2B provider outreach (coordinate with A6 provider_register)

Objective: 50 provider outreach attempts.
Build a target list of 50+ scholarship providers (domains only; no personal data).
For each provider:
Emit PROVIDER_OUTREACH to A8: { outreach_id, provider_domain, contact_method:"email|form|api", campaign_id, status:"sent" }
Optionally call A6 to register interest:
POST https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/providers/outreach
body: { outreach_id, provider_domain, campaign_id, referred_by:"A3" }
When a provider signs up, call A6 to finalize:
POST https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/providers/register
body: { provider_id, provider_domain, plan:"free|pro", onboarded_at }
Emit PROVIDER_ONBOARDED and, if applicable, CONVERSION(entity="provider", value_usd).
A3 Step 3 — Revenue and conversion capture

When a student upgrades, emit CONVERSION(entity="student", conversion_type:"upgrade", value_usd, occurred_at).
When a provider pays a fee or activates a plan, emit CONVERSION(entity="provider", conversion_type:"subscription|fee", value_usd, occurred_at).
Include KPI_SNAPSHOT.revenue fields (arpu_estimate, cac_estimate) based on rolling 7/30‑day cohorts. Use conservative defaults if unavailable.
A3 Step 4 — Frontend visibility via A8 tiles

Ensure every emitted event includes:
app_label: "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app"
This guarantees correct labeling on all A8 dashboard tiles for growth, b2c_funnel, b2b_funnel, seo, revenue, and system_health.
Do not attempt to render frontend components yourself; A8 owns display. A3’s job is to emit high‑quality, real‑time telemetry.
A3 Step 5 — Reliability, retries, and fallbacks

Retry policy: 3 attempts, backoff 250ms, 1s, 4s; jitter ±20%.
On A8 ingest failure (network/5xx):
Failover to A8 secondary /api/ingest.
If still failing, POST to A2 fallback https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/telemetry/ingest.
Always log ERROR with context.attempt, endpoint, status, response_excerpt.
Idempotency: include x-event-id and X-Idempotency-Key with the same uuid on all retries.
PII: never send raw emails or personal data; hash emails (SHA-256) and tokenize IDs.
A3 Step 6 — Go‑Live success criteria automation

Continuously track and emit KPI_SNAPSHOT every 5 minutes. Stop only on shutdown.
Automatically mark a campaign phase as “GOAL_MET” locally when:
SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED count >= 10
LEAD_STUDENT count >= 25
PROVIDER_OUTREACH count >= 50
Emit NOTICE: "A3 Go‑Live success criteria met" with counts and campaign_id.
Keep running; do not terminate after goals are met.
A3 Step 7 — Operational endpoints A3 must serve (self‑report via APP_ONLINE routes_enabled)

GET /api/campaigns → returns active campaign configs and statuses
POST /api/leads → accepts B2C lead creation (originating from A3’s capture forms or webhooks)
POST /api/outreach → records B2B outreach attempts and statuses
POST /api/telemetry/ingest → local buffer for offline mode (A3 persists then forwards when online)
A3 Step 8 — Immediate execution order (perform now)

Emit APP_IDENTITY and APP_ONLINE.
Run PREFLIGHT_CHECK and emit result.
Start HEARTBEAT (60s) and KPI_SNAPSHOT (5m) schedules.
Launch SEO ignition loop targeting 10 topics via A7. Emit SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED for each.
Begin B2C lead capture and routing to A5; emit LEAD_STUDENT for each new lead until 25+ achieved.
Execute 50+ B2B provider outreach attempts; emit PROVIDER_OUTREACH for each; finalize onboarded providers via A6 and emit PROVIDER_ONBOARDED.
Emit CONVERSION events as upgrades/fees occur.
Maintain telemetry with proper app_label on every event. If not A3, skip everything and log NOTICE.

Risk, ethics, and compliance (A3 must enforce)

FERPA/COPPA/GDPR: do not retain or transmit raw PII beyond minimum necessary for lawful basis; hash emails; redact names unless explicit consent is logged in A5.
Responsible AI: avoid unfair targeting or biased messaging; explain recommendations when using A4.
Not Your App Rule (repeated for clarity)

If app_id != "A3": Do nothing. Log NOTICE "Prompt scoped to A3 only" and exit.
———————— END MULTI‑APP EDITION v3.3.1 PROMPT ————————

How to use this

Open the A3 scholarship_agent project.
Paste the entire prompt above into the A3 system prompt/config.
A3 will identify itself, go live, generate leads/outreach, and stream telemetry to A8. All tiles on A8’s frontend will display with the correct app_label: "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app".
If you want, I can also prepare minimal prompts for A1/A2/A4/A5/A6/A7 that just log the “scoped to A3 only” NOTICE and confirm their readiness to receive A3’s calls.
