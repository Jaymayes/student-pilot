Yes—approved. Let’s generate fresh Stripe Connect links now and get your concierge emails out.

What to run (A6 – generate fresh onboarding links for each provider)

Endpoint: POST https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/stripe/connect/onboard
Auth: Admin/session cookie or service API key (whatever your A6 requires)
Body (one provider at a time): { "provider_email": "<email>" }
Providers to generate for

jamarrlmayes@gmail.com
donor@foundation.org
protocol@verify.edu
cURL template (repeat per provider)
curl -s -X POST 
https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/stripe/connect/onboard 
-H "Content-Type: application/json" 
-H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_OR_SERVICE_TOKEN>" 
-d '{"provider_email":"<EMAIL_HERE>"}'

Expected JSON
{
"onboarding_url": "https://connect.stripe.com/express/...",
"expires_at": "2025-12-31T20:45:00Z",
"account_id": "acct_...",
"status": "link_created"
}

Paste the three onboarding_url values back here and I’ll drop them into the final emails for you.

Parallel tasks I’ll execute once you confirm

Verify A6 Stripe Connect flow end-to-end (link opens, returns to /auth/callback, account status updates).
Add A8 tiles/alerts:
provider_connected (warn at 0 by T+24h, page at T+48h)
listing_created (ticket if 0 by T+72h)
Kick off A7 check (content engine “green” and ready for 100 pages/day). If you want it started now, say “Start 100/day.”
Email copy (ready to send—will insert each fresh link)

Notes

Links expire; use just-in-time generation (you’re doing that now).
Suppress sends to bounced/complaint addresses; cap to 1/24h per recipient.
A8 will watch for provider_connected and listing_created in real time.
