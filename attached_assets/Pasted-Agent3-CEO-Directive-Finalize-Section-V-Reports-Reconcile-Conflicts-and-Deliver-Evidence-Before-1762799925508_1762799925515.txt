Agent3 — CEO Directive: Finalize Section V Reports, Reconcile Conflicts, and Deliver Evidence Before Go/Live Windows

Context and standard: All actions must align to our 5‑year plan and KPI model; prioritize low‑CAC organic growth and high reliability. Operate under HOTL governance with explainability and auditable trails for every autonomous action, not black‑box behavior. This is mandatory for trust, compliance, and scale, and it is consistent with our architecture and governance guidance on Replit and autonomous systems   . Maintain the SEO engine momentum per the company Playbook and revenue roadmap; B2B marketplace enablement is a high‑impact lever for ARR acceleration .

Immediate requirements for Agent3 (act only on your assigned app[s]):

Confirm your scope
Reply with the exact app(s) you own from this list: scholar_auth, scholarship_api, scholarship_agent, scholarship_sage, student_pilot, provider_register, auto_page_maker, auto_com_center.
If prior updates referenced apps outside your scope, state “out of scope” and who owns them.
2. Submit Section V status report(s) per app you own — due immediately
Use this exact header and structure per app:

APPLICATION NAME: <name>
APP_BASE_URL: <url>
Status: GO-LIVE READY or DELAYED
Evidence links: attach paths to artifacts (test reports, API docs, probe logs, histograms, audit logs)
Security & Compliance: MFA/SSO, RBAC, TLS in‑transit, encryption at rest, audit logging; attach proofs
Performance & Scalability: uptime, P50/P95 latencies, capacity plan; attach histograms and load results
Integration: OIDC/JWKS and cross‑app paths verified; attach request_id lineage traces
Reliability & DR: circuit breakers, retries, backups, restore drills; attach DR plan and monitoring
Data & BI: data integrity, governance, telemetry; attach dashboards or rollups
UI/UX (if user‑facing): accessibility and guided flows; attach walkthrough or usability results
Testing & Deployment: functional, security, performance, UAT, integration tests; rollback procedure
Compliance posture: FERPA/COPPA readiness narrative, no‑PII logging controls, auditability
ARR Ignition and KPI impact: specify B2C/B2B impact, CAC considerations
3. Resolve contradictory statuses now
The stream you provided contains conflicting statements. Reconcile in your reports with evidence:

auto_com_center: “BLOCKED (AWS SQS credentials)” vs “P0 incident fully resolved; production‑ready.” Provide the single source of truth with artifacts: IAM/AssumeRole config, rotation logs, circuit breaker and DLQ proofs, and live queue worker health. For the queue worker, confirm deployment type; for always‑on background workers, Reserved VM is recommended for predictable uptime and no cold starts; state machine size and SLO budget . Also cite resilience patterns and alerting in use (circuit breakers/backoff) .
scholar_auth: You indicated pre‑soak OK under a temporary performance gate and a 48‑hour remediation target. Provide the 48‑hour plan with milestones (12h/24h/36h/48h) and show pre‑soak probe evidence and P95 reductions toward target. Maintain HOTL approval points and full decision traceability in the evidence bundle per our explainability and accountability standards .
auto_page_maker: Freeze through Nov 12 and daily KPI rollup at 06:00 UTC. Deliver the 2025‑11‑10 rollup file path and confirm no changes. This app is a core organic growth engine — do not risk CAC by changing its footprint while other gates are in motion, consistent with our SEO‑led acquisition model in the Playbook .
4. Go/No‑Go gates and deadlines — provide the evidence

student_pilot (B2C): Conditional GO pending 3 gates: pre‑soak PASS with T+30 evidence, Deliverability GREEN (auto_com_center), and Stripe PASS. Attach histograms, error rates, lineage traces, PKCE proof, revocation proof, and TLS 1.3 verification in the T+30 bundle. Maintain no‑PII logging and RBAC checks.
provider_register (B2B): Waitlist mode stays ON until auth performance and deliverability are GREEN. Pre‑soak participation allowed; deliver T+30 bundle. This unlocks 3% provider fee ARR; align to B2B emphasis in roadmap .
scholarship_api: Participate in pre‑soak; deliver T+30 bundle with lineage from scholar_auth → scholarship_api → consuming apps; keep change freeze intact until evidence is accepted.
scholarship_agent and scholarship_sage: FROZEN observer posture; deliver scheduled telemetry only. Ensure fairness/BI rollups are archived with auditability and HOTL guardrails as per governance guidance .
5. Evidence checklist to attach for each applicable app

Pre‑soak logs and multi‑region probes; P50/P95 histograms; uptime ≥99.9%; error rate ≤0.1%
Security proofs: MFA/SSO config, RBAC matrices, TLS config, no‑PII logging samples, audit log excerpts
Integration: PKCE S256 enforcement, token revocation proof, OIDC discovery/JWKS latencies
Reliability: circuit breaker thresholds, exponential backoff settings, DLQ policy, DR plan
Deployment: deployment type, rollback plan, capacity settings, cost guardrails; for always‑on workers, confirm Reserved VM footprint and rationale
Governance: HOTL approval points, explainability notes, and decision traceability example records
6. CEO decisions and expectations

Data‑first: No GO decisions will be issued on narrative alone; I need verifiable artifacts aligned to our readiness and governance standards for autonomous systems and for Replit deployment hygiene (secrets, environments, monitoring) .
ARR protection: Maintain the Auto Page Maker freeze and deliver KPI rollups on schedule to preserve the SEO flywheel and low CAC per our Playbook trajectory .
Compliance: Maintain conservative defaults; if any uncertainty exists on FERPA/COPPA handling, escalate with a written risk note and proposed mitigation before GO.
Deliverables due immediately

Section V report(s) per assigned app with evidence links (as file paths).
A one‑line Go/No‑Go recommendation per app you own, backed by the attached artifacts.
If auto_com_center is under your scope: confirm the IAM pattern and rotation mechanism in use, validate the queue worker on a Reserved VM footprint, and post the deliverability certification evidence. If it is not your scope, mark “out of scope” and tag the owning DRI. The deployment choice and resilience patterns should follow our recommended practices for background workers and unstable dependencies .
Final note
Our bar is high because trust, reliability, and explainability are the moat. Keep operations lean and autonomous, but always with HOTL oversight and reconstructable audit trails in line with our governance standards for autonomous systems . Once your Section V reports and evidence bundles land, I will issue the formal Go/No‑Go calls and ARR ignition dates.
