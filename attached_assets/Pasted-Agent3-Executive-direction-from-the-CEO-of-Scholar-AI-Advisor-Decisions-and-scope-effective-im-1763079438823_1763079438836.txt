Agent3 — Executive direction from the CEO of Scholar AI Advisor

Decisions and scope, effective immediately

Role: You are promoted to Program Integrator for the next 7 days to drive cross-app readiness to Go-Live. You coordinate deliverables and escalate blockers; DRIs remain accountable for implementation.
Critical path: scholar_auth S2S auth + RBAC is P0. No other launches unblock until that passes acceptance.
Evidence standard: I will only accept artifacts that (a) live in the app’s repo, (b) include timestamps, commands, and raw outputs, and (c) follow the required report header format. Any prior approvals without artifacts are rescinded.
Target SLOs for go-live gates: 99.9% availability architecture, ≤120ms P95 at 250 rps, <0.5% error rate in canary, audited secrets, MFA/SSO verified, RBAC claims enforced, deep health checks, and audit logging. These align with our security posture and continuous hardening principles, including adaptive authentication, integrity monitoring of configurations like CORS, and continuous authorization monitoring to prevent OWASP API risks .
Growth linkage: Auto Page Maker remains our CAC engine. Tie go-live to SEO activation and student “First Document Upload” to improve activation and conversion, consistent with our Playbook’s Year 2 focus and revised roadmap for value creation and ARR scaling .
Access and escalation (1-hour SLA)

Ops: Grant Agent3 read access to all eight Replit workspaces and dashboards within 60 minutes. If access is not granted, each DRI must push evidence to the repo and notify Agent3.
If any workspace access remains blocked after 60 minutes, Agent3 is authorized to reassign evidence collection to the DRI with me as escalation.
Per-app status, directives, and acceptance criteria

Responsible AI and security: Maintain audit trails, revocable credentials, and human-on-the-loop gates for high-risk actions, in line with our platform governance model .
Answers to your explicit questions

Scope: You are Program Integrator. Coordinate across all 8 apps. DRIs remain accountable; you drive the integration schedule, evidence quality, and escalations.
auto_com_center evidence mismatch: Rescinded. Treat as RED until artifacts are delivered and validated by 2:00 PM MST Nov 14.
scholarship_api JWT bug ownership: API Lead fixes post your documented repro/patch plan tonight; do not wait on scholar_auth. You partner with API Lead to validate under load.
Final reminder

Student value is business value. The fastest route to ARR is a trustworthy, fast, and explainable experience that gets students matched and submitting high-quality applications. Keep SEO-driven student acquisition and first-doc-upload activation front and center while we land auth and reliability gates for go-live, consistent with the Playbook’s roadmap and KPIs .
Acknowledge receipt and begin execution. I expect the 2:00 PM MST Nov 14 evidence bundles for auto_com_center, and the 9:00 PM MST tonight deliverables for scholarship_api and scholarship_agent.
