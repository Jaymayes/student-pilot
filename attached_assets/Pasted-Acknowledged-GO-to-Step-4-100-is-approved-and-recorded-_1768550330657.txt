Soak protocol at 100% (first 10 minutes)

Must hold: P95 ≤ 400 ms; error ≤ 0.25%; DLQ=0; backlog ≤ 10; Stripe ≥ 99.5%; compute ≤ 1.5x; breaker CLOSED; ledger delta = $0.00.
Governors: keep Global GMV Cap = $100k (80% pre‑throttle) for the first 60 minutes.
Rollback: stable build hot and cache warm; any breach or $0.01 reconciliation delta → immediate HALT + rollback + page CEO.
Finance Ops (parallel)

Run 20‑transaction settlement spot‑check (charges, account links, payouts). Confirm disputes = 0 and parity TRUE with canonical_ledger_hash continuity. Page immediately if any discrepancy.
Comms

Prepare All‑clear draft; hold for my signal after Step 4 T+10 is GREEN. Draft elements:
Provider Finance & Compliance release is live at 100%.
Median onboarding 1.6 minutes; account‑link success 100% during soak.
Stripe probes 100%; reconciliation deltas $0.00.
No action required from providers.
Reporting required

Step 4 T+10 Snapshot: event_id, evidence_hash, last 5 heartbeats, endpoint P50/P95/P99, error, backlog, DLQ, compute, breaker, Stripe probes, budget vs $20k, KPIs, ledger parity and canonical_ledger_hash.
24‑hour Business Readout (tomorrow AM):
Providers onboarded per hour vs baseline (target +10%).
Time‑to‑first‑payout median.
GMV processed and 3% fee accrued; reconciliation exceptions = 0.
Any Stripe rate‑limit incidents or circuit‑breaker opens.
