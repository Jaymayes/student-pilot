Acknowledged. SEV-1 declared. I am ordering a force restart of the fleet and a telemetry gate bypass now.

Authorizations and hard controls (execute immediately)

Traffic: Set TRAFFIC_CAP_B2C_PILOT = 0 for the restart window. Keep SAFETY_LOCK and auto-refunds active. B2B sessions may momentarily drop; acceptable for 30–60s during cutover.
Telemetry gate: TELEMETRY_STRICT_MODE = false and TELEMETRY_REQUIRE_IDEMPOTENCY = false on scholarship_api and A8 ingestion. Accept all events with 200/202. Log “missing_header” and compute sha256(body) for post-hoc dedupe.
Fleet SEO: WAF block on all sitemap endpoints and revoke scheduler tokens across all workspaces. This is in addition to pausing internal jobs.
Probes: Disable localhost and /metrics/p95 probes fleet-wide until the unified /metrics + A8 p95 aggregate is confirmed.
SEV-1 force restart plan (A1–A8)
Sequence (repeat for each app, but start with A7, A8, then A1, then A3, then the rest):

Quiesce and snapshot
Capture 30s of logs and open file descriptors.
Record current PID, commit_sha, build_artifact_sha, manifest_digest.
2. Hard stop and rebuild

Kill running process (kill -9) and stop the container/process supervisor.
Clear any resident cron/scheduler in the web process.
Rebuild/restart from the Golden Path manifest; inject version labels into boot logs.
3. Verify green before next app

Confirm new PID differs from snapshot and boot logs show the new commit and digest.
Health markers: 200 + functional markers; for A1 confirm db_connected=true, pool_in_use/idle/total sane, and pool_utilization <50% after warm.
Synthetic: hit only the public https origin; follow redirects; confirm two consecutive passes.
Observability: POST to /api/analytics/events without X-Idempotency-Key returns 202; queue depth declines; no 428s.
Post-restart truth probes (must pass before restoring 2%)

Telemetry acceptance
Target ≥99% acceptance for 15 consecutive minutes; 0 HTTP 428; A8 queue depth trending to <100; no “fallback failed” lines.
SEO suppression
0 sitemap 429 lines across all workspaces for 30 minutes (WAF confirms blocks).
Auth health
Provider synthetic flow P95 ≤500ms; /api/login P95 ≤200ms; auth 5xx=0; policy blocks (401/403/429) reported separately.
CPU/event-loop
Event-loop-lag p95 <100ms; no node-cron “missed execution” on web processes (cron jobs must run only on worker VMs).
DB latency
Raw DB p95 ≤100ms sustained with slow-query log at 80ms; no statement timeouts.
Data integrity and clean-up

Accept duplicates now; preserve raw payloads. After ingestion stabilizes, run a post-hoc dedupe job keyed on coalesce(request_id, sha256(body)), collapsing duplicates in business_events. Maintain a unique index on that key going forward.
Owner-specific tasks and confirmations (must be posted to A8/shiproom)

Platform SRE
Execute the force restart across A7, A8, A1, A3, then remaining services.
Post PID-before/PID-after, commit_sha, and manifest_digest per app.
Attach a log snippet showing 202 acceptance for a synthetic telemetry POST with no idempotency header.
Growth Eng (A7)
Confirm WAF rule IDs and show 0 sitemap hits for 30 minutes; post the WAF log extract.
Watchtower
Replace localhost probes; confirm unified /metrics is scraped and A8 is emitting p95 aggregates. Disable /metrics/p95 direct probes.
Post a single “window_closed_at” timestamp with each snapshot to prevent stale “green mirage.”
Rollback/kill conditions (auto)

If after restart the Telemetry Acceptance Ratio <95% for any rolling 10 minutes OR provider synthetic P95 >500ms OR any auth 5xx appears, keep B2C at 0% and open/append to the SEV-1 CIR.
Exit and restore path

When all post-restart probes above pass for 15 minutes:
Restore TRAFFIC_CAP_B2C_PILOT to 2%.
Continue the 30-minute telemetry ≥99% acceptance run to clear SEV-1 to SEV-2, then into normal watch.
Gate 1 (5%) remains NO GO until 24h stability and breaker closed/stable.
Communications

Post “Emergency restart to remediate telemetry and background worker drift” to status page (5–10 min window). Notify the 10-provider cohort; reassure no data loss and minor interruption possible.
What I expect back

A8 attestation IDs per restart phase (A7, A8, A1, A3, others) with:
New PID/commit/digest, health markers, telemetry 202 sample, acceptance ratio, queue depth, DB p95, event-loop p95, and WAF confirmation.
A clean log tail excerpt showing:
0 telemetry 428s
0 sitemap 429s
No localhost/301 synthetic errors
No node-cron missed execution on web processes
Proceed. Stop the bleeding now; verify with log evidence, not dashboards.
