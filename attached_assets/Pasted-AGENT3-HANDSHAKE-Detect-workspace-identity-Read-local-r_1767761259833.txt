AGENT3_HANDSHAKE

Detect workspace identity:
Read local repo/workspace slug and staging base URL from env/code.
Match against APPS TABLE by repo_hint and base_url_staging.
Set:
ASSIGNED_APP = {A1|A2|A3|A4|A5|A6|A7|A8}
APP_BASE_URL = matched staging URL (or discovered endpoint)
REPO_NAME = local repo/workspace name
VERSION = current git sha (or git_sha_dynamic)
ACK: I will execute only “YOUR APP SECTION [ASSIGNED_APP]”. All other sections are read‑only context. Start in Diagnostic Mode. No production mutations without HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED.
GLOBAL POLICY & ORCHESTRATOR

Modes:
Diagnostic Mode (read‑only; staging‑first).
Staging Fix Mode: Branch → Fix → Stage → Validate → PR. Pause for HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED before any production change.
Production Change Mode: requires HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED.
Environment/Tags:
Staging primary; production diagnostics only (no writes/migrations/config changes).
Tag synthetic events: env=staging, namespace=simulated_audit, version=${VERSION}.
SLO targets:
P95 ≤150ms; 0% 5xx in simulated flows (any 5xx requires evidence and RCA).
Evidence rules:
No issue is valid without logs/traces/DB records and, where applicable, A8 visibility tied to the same event_id.
Human‑in‑loop gates (STOP CONDITIONS → HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED):
Production writes; secret rotation/creation; enabling/disabling A8 write scopes; schema/alert changes; deployment restarts; cost‑impacting autoscale; PR merges to main.
Constraints:
Never print secrets; verify presence by name only. Operate only within YOUR APP SECTION.
GLOBAL VERIFICATION PLAN

Discovery: system_map.json; connectivity_matrix.csv; list required secrets by name; health endpoints.
Observability: slo_metrics.json (24h/7d P50/P95/P99; error rates); structured logs with trace_id and request_context.
Security & Resiliency: TLS on all hops; internal token auth; OIDC state/nonce; staging tests with 500ms latency and 503 responses; verify retries/backoff and circuit‑breaker behavior; document in resiliency_config.md.
Data Quality & A8 Lineage: validate Avro/JSON schemas and env/namespace/version tags; prove lineage event_id → A2 → A8 raw → A8 dashboards; export to a8_data_lineage.md and a8_validation_results.json.
Performance/Cost hotspots: detect synchronous chains >200ms; propose async/queue refactors.
E2E WORKFLOWS (run only steps touching your app; safely stub others)

Marketing_SEO_A7: Sitemap → Indexing → Attribution → A8 SEO tile.
Lead_Gen_A5_A1_A3: Signup → OIDC → CRM capture → bus (idempotency) → A8 Growth tile.
B2B_Revenue_A6_A2_A8: Provider funnel (Lead→Demo→Contract→Live); simulate $1000 GMV and $10 AI cost; verify 3% fee ($30) and 4x markup ($40); confirm A8 Finance tile.
Learning_A5_A4: Doc ingest → essay AI → success metric → A8 Outcomes tile.
RL ERROR‑CORRECTION LOOP

Monitor → Reflect (capture failure evidence) → Synthesize regression test (namespace=simulated_audit) → Propose PR (branch) → Verify (reward: fewer errors, improved P95, higher E2E pass rate) → Update docs/runbooks. Do not merge/promote without HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED.
ENTERPRISE GRADE READINESS (target 100%)

Compute egrs_score.json with weights: Security 15; Auth_Health 10; Reliability 15; Observability 10; Data_Quality_A8 15; E2E_Workflows 15; Performance 10; Cost_Scale 5; Human_Gates 5.
Accept 100% only if: no P0/P1 issues; all tiles live; all E2E workflows green; P95 ≤150ms; 0% 5xx in staged flows; proven lineage; auto‑healing checks pass; docs/runbooks updated.
Summarize score and “Path to 100%” in exec_summary.md.

YOUR APP SECTION [A1: scholar_auth] — Execute only if ASSIGNED_APP=A1

Validate A1‑001: full OIDC redirect‑chain trace; inspect Set‑Cookie flags (SameSite=None, Secure=True) and Domain; validate client_id allowlist; add interaction delay; run 10/10 login flows; export auth_trace_log.json; oidc_config_audit.md.

Success criteria: Login succeeds; Growth/Outcomes tiles update.
YOUR APP SECTION [A6: provider_register] — Execute only if ASSIGNED_APP=A6

Capture live publishing evidence:
Export migration validation logs (“Failed to validate database migrations”; “Cannot validate statements, stage already exists”; “Failed to monitor preview status”) to /reports/scholar_audit/.../a6_migration_logs.txt.
Zero‑Downtime DB Migration Playbook:
Schema diff vs production and SHADOW validation: generate migration diff; create a fresh shadow/preview DB; run full validation there (no prod mutations).
If “stage already exists”: safely repair preview/shadow stage (reset preview metadata/hooks, recreate shadow) without touching production data; re‑validate.
Non‑destructive path for any breaking changes: add nullable columns with defaults; dual‑write (old/new); backfill; verify reads; swap to new; schedule legacy drop later.
Idempotency/guards: every step no‑ops if already applied; ordered/transactional where supported.
Staging Fix Mode:
Branch fix/ext-deployment-migrations
Apply to staging; smoke test /health, /register, /api/billing
Provider funnel: Lead→Demo→Contract→Live
Simulate $1000 GMV and $10 AI cost; verify Finance events fee=3% ($30) and 4x markup ($40); confirm A8 Finance tile
Export: provider_stack_trace.log; billing_logic_verification.md; provider_funnel_tests.json
Rollback plan: down migration or reversible steps; test on shadow/staging.
Promotion plan (HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED): publish with monitored window; verify endpoints 200; confirm Finance tile; finalize.
Success criteria: External /register 200; migrations validated; Finance tile shows correct 3% and 4x entries.

Tasks: validate /api/ingest and /dashboard/status; reconcile “apps connected” vs raw ingestion; verify Stripe read config; ensure dashboards include namespace=simulated_audit.
Staging Fix Mode: branch fix/dash-wiring; update dashboard queries/SQL; fallback merges only when central lacks business keys; revenue derived from real payload.value; keep READ_ONLY_LOCK unchanged; stage deploy; PR; pause.
Success criteria: All tiles (Growth, Finance, SEO, Outcomes) populate with simulated_audit data; lineage proven.
EXECUTION ORDER

Global Discovery → Build system_map.json and connectivity_matrix.csv; export slo_metrics.json; send a minimal namespaced synthetic event to verify A8 schema/tags.
App Diagnostics/Fixes → Execute YOUR APP SECTION; if needed, enter Staging Fix Mode (branch → fix → stage → validate → PR). Pause for HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED before any production change.
Global E2E → Run relevant E2E workflows; for B2B revenue, verify 3% fee and 4x markup; confirm A8 Finance tile; update a8_validation_results.json and a8_data_lineage.md.
Reporting & Cleanup → Compute EGRS and write egrs_score.json; produce exec_summary.md with a concrete “Path to 100%”; update A8 (staging) Audit Status panel (read‑only) with links to artifacts; provide cleanup_audit.sh and dry‑run it.
