Below is the Master Execution Prompt for Agent3. It combines all eight apps. Agent3 must read the entire prompt once, then strictly execute only the APP SECTION that matches its repository. Do not touch or modify other apps. All outputs and evidence must be real and verifiable.

MASTER EXECUTION PROMPT — READ FULLY, THEN EXECUTE ONLY YOUR APP SECTION

Identity and scope

You are Agent3 executing production readiness for a single app in the Scholar AI Advisor ecosystem.
Apps and base URLs:
scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_api → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_agent → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_sage → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
student_pilot → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
provider_register → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_com_center → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Your mandate

Goal today: Get your assigned app to 100% production-ready, integrated, and revenue-capable as part of the end-to-end system.
If 100% today is not possible, you must:
Set Status: YELLOW or RED.
Provide exact ETA to start generating revenue (hours).
List the third-party prerequisites or environment secrets blocking revenue.
Only work on the APP SECTION that matches your repository. Do not change other apps.
Required status line and file header

At the start of your console/log output, print exactly: App: <app_name> | Status: <GREEN|YELLOW|RED> | Revenue today: <YES|CONDITIONAL YES|NO> | ETA: <0 hours|X hours> | Third-party prerequisites: <list with ✅/⏳/❌>
The first line in every deliverable file must be: App: <app_name> | APP_BASE_URL: <app_base_url>
“Have the app name itself with the base APP_BASE_URL on all reports” is mandatory.
Deliverables (exactly 7 files)
Create these seven files in your repository root. Use the exact filenames below:

<app>_DAY0_READINESS_REPORT.md
<app>_INTEGRATION_MATRIX.md
<app>_REVENUE_ON_STATEMENT.md
<app>_SECURITY_COMPLIANCE.md
<app>_PERF_SNAPSHOT.json
<app>_SMOKE_TEST_RESULTS.md
<app>_SLO_SNAPSHOT.md
Global SLO targets and guardrails

Uptime target: ≥ 99.9%
P95 latency target: ≤ 120 ms (unless otherwise noted)
Error rate target: < 0.5%
Success rate target: ≥ 99%
Auto-rollback criteria (if persist ≥ 10 minutes): P95 > 120 ms; error rate > 2%; 5xx > 0.5%; abnormal auth failures.
Evidence must be real: include exact requests/responses, timestamps, status codes, and correlation IDs where applicable. Do not fabricate evidence. If a dependency is unavailable, state “not reachable”, provide fix steps, and ETA.
Revenue today definitions (use these to set your status)

scholar_auth: YES if it can issue and validate JWTs with non-null scope and correct issuer for student_pilot and provider_register (RBAC-enabled).
scholarship_api: YES if student_pilot and auto_page_maker can read listings now with acceptable performance and correct CORS/ETag behavior.
scholarship_agent: YES if campaigns can run end-to-end to generate sessions/leads to student_pilot now (even if some monitoring endpoints are pending).
scholarship_sage: YES if student_pilot can call recommendations and application-assist endpoints (with guardrails) to create upsell opportunities now.
student_pilot: YES if a student can register, see scholarships, purchase credits or a plan via Stripe (live), receive confirmation email via auto_com_center, and access AI features.
provider_register: YES if a provider can onboard, connect Stripe (live), and pay to post a listing (with platform fee logic) today.
auto_page_maker: CONDITIONAL YES immediately after publish if site is production-accessible with proper SEO (sitemap, canonicals, schema) and UTM links to student_pilot; indexing delay (24–72h) is acceptable.
auto_com_center: YES if it can send real emails (welcome, receipts, campaign notifications) via Postmark with messageId returned and webhooks received.
Post-publish 5-minute verification protocol (for every app)

Verify /healthz and /readyz return 200.
Check all dependencies are healthy.
Capture SLO snapshot and write to <app>_SLO_SNAPSHOT.md and <app>_PERF_SNAPSHOT.json.
Execute one revenue-path transaction relevant for your app and log evidence.
Start a 2-hour watch with anomaly notes and rollback criteria documented.

What to include in each deliverable

DAY0_READINESS_REPORT.md
Executive summary; final REQUIRED STATUS LINE (same as console); key risks; exact ETA if YELLOW/RED.
INTEGRATION_MATRIX.md
Upstream/downstream dependencies; URLs; health checks; contract assumptions; service-to-service auth flows; CORS notes.

Define “Revenue today” for your app; show how it is achieved; include at least one real transaction or surrogate event with IDs and timestamps; describe attribution and UTM flow if applicable.
SECURITY_COMPLIANCE.md
FERPA/COPPA/GDPR posture; Responsible AI commitments; RBAC and JWT validation; rate limiting; security headers; PII handling; audit trails.

Output format and completion statement

Start of output: REQUIRED STATUS LINE exactly as specified.
End of output: Print a single-line completion marker: AGENT3 EXECUTION COMPLETE - <app_name> | APP_BASE_URL: <app_base_url>
Notes and constraints

Do not modify other apps or files outside your repository.
Do not fabricate evidence. If a dependency is not reachable, mark it, provide steps and ETA.
If “Revenue today” is CONDITIONAL YES due to a trivial manual publish step (e.g., production domain), that is acceptable. State the action, the expected time (<5 minutes), and confirm all technical prerequisites are satisfied.
Use cautious defaults for any rate limits and ensure they are documented.
Keep your console output concise but complete; detailed evidence goes into the 7 deliverables.
That is the full Master Execution Prompt for Agent3. Execute only the section matching your app.
