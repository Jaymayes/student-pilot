START PROMPT
You are receiving a combined cross-app reporting request from the CEO of Scholar AI Advisor.

## Objective
Produce a standardized “Since Go-Live” operational report for your app only. This report must cover:
1.  What work your app has done since going live
2.  How many leads your app has brought in (and how)
3.  What is currently stopping revenue
4.  What is missing for your app to fully do its job
5.  What you recommend we do next (actionable, with owners and timelines)

## Critical directives
1.  Only use the part of this prompt that relates to your app. Ignore all other app sections.
2.  Before doing any work, identify your app with both its `app_name` and `APP_BASE_URL`. This identification must appear at the top of every output and in the machine-readable JSON.
3.  Follow the global output format exactly (JSON first, then a concise human-readable summary).
4.  If any data is missing, return "unknown" and include a short “how_to_get” plan.
5.  Observe our SLOs: 99.9% uptime and ~120ms P95 latency. Report compliance or gaps.
6.  Definitions of “leads” and expected revenue paths are specified per-app below; use your app’s definitions precisely.

## Global output format (all apps must follow this)
Produce your output in two parts, in this exact order:

**Part A: MACHINE_READABLE_JSON (single JSON object on one line)**
Fields required:
* `app_name`: string
* `app_base_url`: string
* `environment`: string (prod, staging, etc.)
* `timestamp_utc`: ISO8601
* `go_live_date`: ISO8601 or "unknown"
* `version_or_release_tag`: string or "unknown"
* `work_done_since_go_live`: list of strings (features shipped, migrations, integrations, optimizations, incidents handled, etc.)
* `usage_kpis`: object containing keys relevant to your app (see your section)
* `lead_metrics`: object
    * `total_leads`: integer (as defined in your section)
    * `leads_by_source`: object {source: count}
    * `attribution_method`: short string
* `revenue_path_status`: object
    * `expected_revenue_mechanism`: short string (per your section)
    * `current_blockers_to_revenue`: list of strings (technical, product, compliance, GTM, data, etc.)
    * `current_enablers`: list of strings (what’s already in place)
* `slo_and_quality`: object
    * `uptime_percent`: number or "unknown"
    * `p95_latency_ms`: number or "unknown"
    * `error_rate_percent`: number or "unknown"
    * `security_incidents_since_go_live`: integer
* `dependencies_and_gaps`: object
    * `missing_capabilities`: list of strings
    * `external_dependencies`: list of strings (teams, systems, approvals)
    * `data_gaps`: list of strings (what data is missing and why)
* `recommendations_next_30_days`: list of objects
    * `{action: string, owner: string, eta_days: integer, expected_impact: string, priority: P0|P1|P2}`
* `evidence_and_sources`: list of strings (log paths, dashboards, endpoints queried)
* `notes`: string

**Part B: HUMAN_SUMMARY (concise)**
1.  App identification (name and base URL)
2.  Since go-live: 3–6 bullets highlighting delivered value and key learnings
3.  Leads: total and top sources
4.  What’s stopping revenue: top 3, with 1-line diagnosis each
5.  What’s missing to do the job: top 3
6.  Next steps: top 5 actions with owners and ETAs

**If you cannot compute a metric:**
* Put "unknown" in the JSON field.
* Add a short step-by-step in notes describing how to retrieve it (e.g., “Query table X, join Y on Z, 7-day window, group by …”).

## App identification and base URLs (use yours only)
* scholar_auth → `https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app`
* scholarship_api → `https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app`
* scholarship_agent → `https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app`
* scholarship_sage → `https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app`
* student_pilot → `https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app`
* provider_register → `https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app`
* auto_page_maker → `https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app`
* auto_com_center → `https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app`

## Cross-app common KPIs (apply only those relevant to your app)
* Uptime (%), P95 latency (ms), error rates (%), unique users, active users, sessions, conversion events, API RPS.
* **Leads:** B2C = prospective students captured (e.g., sign-ups, started application). B2B = providers initiated onboarding or completed activation. If your app’s section redefines “lead,” use that override.
* **Revenue paths:** B2C credits/subscriptions; B2B 3% provider fee; 4x markup on AI services. Your section clarifies which apply.

## Execution steps (do this in order)
1.  **Identify yourself:** Output your `app_name` and `APP_BASE_URL` (both in the JSON and human summary).
2.  **Establish go_live_date:** Use your earliest production artifact if unknown; otherwise return "unknown" and add how_to_get in notes.
3.  **Compile your work_done_since_go_live:** List major releases, features, migrations, incident fixes, and integrations.
4.  **Compute usage_kpis and lead_metrics** as defined in your section.
5.  **Assess revenue_path_status:** Identify current blockers and enablers aligned to our B2C/B2B model.
6.  **Report SLOs:** uptime, P95 latency, error rates; note any breaches and their causes.
7.  **List dependencies_and_gaps:** What’s missing for you to fully do your job; include external dependencies and data gaps.
8.  **Recommend actions:** 30-day plan with owners, ETAs, expected impact, and priority.
9.  **Provide evidence_and_sources:** URLs, dashboards, log locations, or endpoints you used.

## Validation
* Ensure the JSON is valid, single-line, and includes all required fields.
* Ensure the human summary is consistent with the JSON.
* Ensure your `app_name` and `APP_BASE_URL` appear at the top of both outputs.
