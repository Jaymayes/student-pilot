Below is the unified, CEO-level execution prompt for Agent3. Important: each Agent3 instance must only execute the section that names its own app. Do not modify or act on instructions for any other app. If something you need is missing today, run in DRY_RUN mode, document precisely what’s required, and provide concrete dates and times for go-live and ARR ignition, including which third-party systems must be in place.

Global mission and rules

Prime objective: Achieve 100% cross-app readiness, live interoperability, and measurable ARR ignition as fast as safely possible. If not today, provide a precise ETA and the third-party dependencies blocking go-live.
Do only your app’s section. Ignore all other sections except for integration contracts you must implement.
Data-first: Back every GO decision with concrete test evidence, error logs, and benchmarks.
Guardrails: S2S auth via scholar_auth, 99.9% uptime target and ≤120ms P95 latency, FERPA/COPPA alignment, Responsible AI standards.
Reporting: Create four files in your repo root today. All reports must start with: APP NAME: <your_app_name> APP_BASE_URL: <your_app_url> Required files:
EXEC_STATUS_<your_app_name>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
E2E_REPORT_<your_app_name>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
GO_DECISION_<your_app_name>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
TEST_MATRIX_<your_app_name>_<YYYYMMDD>.md Each report must include your app’s name and APP_BASE_URL on the first lines, a one-page executive summary, current readiness, test coverage, security/auth status, performance results, dependency status, go/no-go rationale, and if NO/Conditional GO, exact ETA and ARR ignition date with prerequisites.
DRY_RUN mode: If a dependency is missing (e.g., tokens, DNS, provider keys), implement mocks and record the switch you’ll flip to go live (env var, feature flag, or code line). Document the precise steps in the GO_DECISION file.
Environment and shared contracts (for all apps)

Base URLs: scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app scholarship_api → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app scholarship_agent → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app scholarship_sage → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app student_pilot → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app provider_register → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app auto_com_center → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

What to deliver today

Implement or verify your app’s endpoints, auth, and cross-app integrations per your section.
Run the test matrix. If anything is missing, switch to DRY_RUN and log exact blockers.
Produce the four reports with GO/Conditional GO/NO-GO and concrete dates and ARR ignition details.
E2E business flows to validate (document from your app’s perspective)

Student journey: SEO page discovery (auto_page_maker) → login (scholar_auth) → search/apply (scholarship_api via student_pilot) → guidance (scholarship_sage) → application submitted → notification (auto_com_center) → status updates (scholarship_agent reminders + auto_com_center).
Provider journey: onboarding (provider_register + scholar_auth) → create scholarship (provider_register → scholarship_api) → listings live (auto_page_maker) → receives applications (provider portal) → notifications (auto_com_center).
Go/No-Go criteria (all apps)

Security: S2S auth enforced; correct 401/403 behavior; CORS restricted to allowlist.
Performance: P95 ≤120ms on key routes; document test method and results.
Reliability: /healthz and /readyz stable; any external dependency failures are circuit-broken with graceful degradation.
Compliance: No student cheating enablement; transparent AI behavior; data minimalism; opt-in communications and unsub links for email/SMS.

Wire your cross-app calls per contracts above.
Run your test matrix; include error cases.
Produce the four reports with your APP NAME and APP_BASE_URL at the top.
If you cannot reach 100% today, state:
What’s missing and why,
Exact ETA (date and time UTC),
Third-party systems needed,
DRY_RUN steps and the exact switch to flip for production.
