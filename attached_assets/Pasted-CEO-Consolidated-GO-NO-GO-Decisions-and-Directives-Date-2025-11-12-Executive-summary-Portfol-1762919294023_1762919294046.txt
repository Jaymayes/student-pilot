CEO Consolidated GO/NO‑GO Decisions and Directives
Date: 2025‑11‑12

Executive summary

Portfolio posture: We are on track for a controlled multi‑app launch over the next 24–48 hours with two hard gates blocking GA: Gate A (deliverability) and Gate C (auth P95). Maintain freeze discipline until scheduled windows. Protect SEO-led, zero‑CAC growth.
Application decisions, evidence, and gates

auto_com_center APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: GO-LIVE READY (confirmed)
Notes: Evidence endpoints returning 200; P95 ~20 ms; uptime 100%. Proceed with Gate A deliverability certification per schedule. Add rate‑limit and abuse detection dashboards into scholarship_sage by EOD+1.

Cross‑portfolio gates and timelines

Freeze lift: Today 20:00 UTC.
Gate A (Deliverability, auto_com_center): 20:00–20:15 UTC today. If DKIM/CNAMEs not provisioned by 14:00 UTC checkpoint, execute ESP pivot per plan.
Gate C (Authentication, scholar_auth): 20:00–20:15 UTC today, target P95 ≤120 ms under load. If fail, immediate rollback and optimization sprint; re‑attempt by 22:00 UTC with cache, query, and pool tuning.
DSAR implementation window: 20:00–22:00 UTC today (joint session), verify by Nov 13, 16:00 UTC for scholarship_api and student_pilot.
Immediate CEO directives

Security and compliance

DSAR endpoints: scholarship_api and student_pilot DRIs deliver tonight; legal to certify by tomorrow 12:00 UTC.
Age gate: student_pilot to enforce under‑13 block and consent flows by tomorrow 16:00 UTC.
WAF/DoS and per‑tenant rate limits: scholarship_api and scholar_auth to publish thresholds and runbooks by tomorrow 12:00 UTC.
SLOs and observability

Maintain portfolio SLOs: uptime ≥99.9%, P95 ≤120 ms, error rate ≤0.1%.
scholarship_sage: integrate rate‑limit/abuse dashboards by EOD+1 and add CAC/provider revenue tiles.
Evidence discipline: All apps must keep /api/evidence current with SHA‑256 checksums and link to /openapi.json and /docs.
Growth and ARR ignition

SEO flywheel: auto_page_maker remains GREEN; no code changes pre‑Gate A/C windows.
B2C ignition: student_pilot + scholarship_api DSAR complete → enable paid credit packs at 4× AI markup; target activation window Nov 13–15.
B2B ignition: provider_register limited beta (5–10 providers) Nov 14, 09:00 UTC upon Gate B PASS; GA after Gate C PASS and 48 hours of stable ops.
scholarship_agent: remain in observer mode; begin warm‑up sends only after latency SLO ≤120 ms and consent checks pass. No broad campaigns before warm‑up milestones.
Risk register and mitigations

Gate C fail (auth latency): Hard blocker to GA. Mitigation: pre‑staged DB/index tuning, token cache, connection pool right‑sizing, and canary load profile. Escalation T+15 minutes if second attempt misses target.
Gate A issues (DKIM/CNAME delays): Execute ESP pivot at 14:00 UTC checkpoint; keep suppression lists unified; preserve sender reputation.
DSAR/Legal slippage: Blocks student_pilot and scholarship_api GA. Add parallel legal review track; pre‑draft DSAR responses; run red‑team request simulations.
Vite SPA intercept (non‑blocking): Fix within 48 hours to restore static evidence routes; evidence markdown remains accessible.
KPI targets and reporting cadence (next 7–14 days)

Daily 06:00 UTC rollups to scholarship_sage continue.
Activation rate: ≥30%; free→paid conversion: 6–10%; ARPU: $8–12; organic traffic share ≥40%.
Portfolio SLOs maintained; error budget burn rate ≤20% of monthly budget.
Report CAC and provider revenue tiles starting Nov 13–14; CEO dashboard to include Gate A/C status, DSAR completion, activation, conversion, ARPU, and indexed pages.
ARR ignition dates (estimates)

B2C credits revenue: Start Nov 13–15 (post DSAR + Gate C), with progressive ramp tied to SEO traffic.
B2B provider fees (3%): Limited beta starts Nov 14 upon Gate B PASS; GA after Gate C PASS and 48 hours of stability (estimated Nov 15–16).
Campaign‑driven lift (scholarship_agent): Post‑latency SLO and warm‑up completion (est. Dec 4) to scale responsible outreach.
Owner assignments and confirmations (DRIs)

scholar_auth Gate C: Auth DRI, today 20:00 UTC; escalation to CEO T+15 if miss.
DSAR endpoints: scholarship_api and student_pilot DRIs, joint session 21:00–22:00 UTC; verification by Nov 13, 16:00 UTC.
Gate B execution: provider_register DRI with Finance, today 18:00–18:15 UTC.
Rate‑limit/abuse dashboards: scholarship_sage DRI, EOD+1.
Required DRI responses

Acknowledge decisions and timelines within 30 minutes.
Confirm readiness for Gate A and Gate C windows.
Post updated evidence links to each app’s /api/evidence upon completion of each milestone.
Final CEO decisions

GO: auto_com_center, auto_page_maker (post‑freeze rollout), scholarship_sage (Observer Mode), scholarship_agent (Observer Mode).
CONDITIONAL GO: scholarship_api (DSAR + Gate C), provider_register (limited beta on Gate B PASS; GA dependent on Gate C).
DELAYED: student_pilot (pending DSAR, age gate, legal sign‑off, and Gates A/C).
Execute with urgency, protect the SEO engine, and keep the evidence trail airtight. Our path to profitable ARR depends on zero‑CAC growth, impeccable performance, and trust.
