CEO Decision: Conditional GO for First Live Dollar, with 48-hour execution window

Strategic rationale

This validates the B2C engine, establishes KPI baselines, and de-risks the revenue architecture with minimal spend, consistent with our organic-first growth model and the five‑year plan milestones for MAU and ARR expansion via SEO and partnerships .
Execution must be resilient and observable; distributed coordination across our Replit microservices requires explicit contracts, retries, security, and human oversight beyond what Agent3 can infer autonomously .
GO gate: three non‑negotiables (approve immediately upon proof)

Payments: Stripe LIVE keys + LIVE webhook delivering 200 OK to our payment handler; no test keys anywhere (sk_live, pk_live, whsec required) .
Security: scholar_auth issuer/audience alignment and JWKS validation enforced by every protected endpoint in scholarship_api; 401 without token; P95 under ~120 ms .
CORS: allowlist only (ecosystem domains), no wildcards, verified on scholarship_api and comms service .
48-hour execution plan

T+0 to T+3 hours
Owners post Production Status Report (4 sections) for each app and a one-page readiness screenshot pack (secrets present, health 200, auth check, CORS check).
Auto Page Maker: ramp to 200–500 high‑intent pages/day pointing to Student Pilot with “Apply Now,” sitemap.xml auto-update, internal links organized by intent clusters; this is our lowest‑CAC engine and must remain priority one for acquisition .
T+3 to T+24 hours
Dry run: end‑to‑end checkout flow in a closed window with logging on; verify no CORS/401s and that auth scopes resolve in <150 ms.
Instrument observability: consistent JSON errors, request IDs, and minimal metrics (latency P50/P95, error rate) so we can calculate time‑to‑ledger and time‑to‑email on test day .
T+24 to T+48 hours
Execute $9.99 “first live dollar” test once the three GO gates pass.
Capture evidence bundle for board/KPI baselining (Payment Intent ID, LIVE mode screenshots, webhook delivery, ledger post with timestamps, receipt email, browser console/network, end‑to‑end latency). Produce a 1‑page KPI summary: ARPU, free→paid conversion, CAC attribution (organic), time‑to‑first‑dollar, payment→ledger and payment→email latencies.
KPI baseline to publish after test

B2C: ARPU from credit sale; free→paid conversion for checkout cohort; end‑to‑end latency (click→confirmation).
Cost: CAC (organic = $0 media; content cost noted separately).
Ops: P95 latency by app; error rate; service health 200s; webhook success rate.
B2B: if a provider posts during the window, record 3% fee capture and views/clicks analytics (seed for provider ROI narrative).
Owner assignments and 24‑hour deliverables

Auth Lead (scholar_auth)
Deliver: issuer, audience, JWKS URL; /verify or lib‑based RS256 validation guidance; test JWT including scope claims.
Evidence: JWKS GET 200, token introspection success/fail cases.
API Lead (scholarship_api)
Deliver: GET /scholarships (public/filtered), POST /scholarships (provider‑only), credits ledger endpoints, strict schema validation, CORS allowlist.
Evidence: 401 without token, 200 with proper scopes; latency P95 ≤120 ms; JSON error format.
Payments Lead (provider_register)
Deliver: Stripe LIVE keys and LIVE webhook configured, NOTIFY secret parity with comms.
Evidence: Stripe dashboard (LIVE) webhook delivery 200 to our endpoint.
Comms Lead (auto_com_center)
Deliver: POST /send‑notification webhook; SendGrid/Twilio set; templates enabled.
Evidence: test message ID and delivery timestamp; CORS allowlist.
Frontend Lead (student_pilot)
Deliver: Application Tracker UI, profile completion bar, fetches via scholarship_api only.
Evidence: Browser console/network clean during dry run; apply button routes correctly.
Risk, compliance, and resiliency directives

Responsible AI: enforce no ghostwriting/cheating assistance; advice must cite database links and be explainable; bias‑mitigation and transparency logs retained .
Reliability: add retries with exponential backoff and circuit breakers between services; treat inter‑service calls as unreliable by default .
Governance and observability: treat each API as a product with clear ownership and consistent documentation; centralize auth, traffic policy, and metrics to keep the ecosystem manageable under autonomy .
Capital allocation and runway support (parallel track)

Fund SOC 2 and GTM readiness with non‑dilutive capital while we scale organic B2C/B2B:
Primary: Prestamos CDFI via SSBCI Loan Guarantee for runway and startup costs eligibility; narrative is risk‑mitigated principal with program alignment .
High‑upside parallel: ECMC Foundation PRI (~$250k precedent; mission‑aligned “impact‑first” thesis) to support our scholarship access mission and B2B scaleup .
SOC 2 positioned explicitly as a revenue and enterprise GTM enabler, not a cost center .
Spend focus: 0 paid media for first‑dollar; concentrate budget on reliability, security, and SEO content velocity.
What I need from the team now

Post your 4‑section Production Status Report and evidence screenshots within 24 hours.
Confirm when the three GO gates are green; I will authorize the live test immediately.
Confirm: Do you want me to issue the clock start for the 48‑hour execution window now and notify the five owners to deliver their reports by EOD tomorrow?
