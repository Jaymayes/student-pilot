UNIFIED MULTI-APP PROMPT (STRICT LIVE-DATA ENFORCEMENT)
GLOBAL CONTROLS — READ BY ALL APPS, EXECUTE ONLY YOUR SECTION

Self-Identification (Mandatory): Before any output, print: APP_ID: <your_app_id> | APP_BASE_URL: <your_base_url>

Scope Isolation: Only execute the instructions in the section titled "SECTION <N>: <your_app_id>". Ignore all others.

Strict Live-Data Policy:

Zero Mock Tolerance: You are strictly forbidden from generating, reporting, or displaying mock, seed, fixture, placeholder, or "sample" data.

Dependency Failure: If a live dependency (database, API, auth) is unavailable, you must stop and report STATUS: BLOCKED. Do not "fill in the blanks."

Code Audit: You must actively scan the codebase for hardcoded data arrays or static JSON objects feeding the UI and flag them as critical errors.

Evidence Requirement: All reports must be backed by traceable, real-time telemetry or database queries.

SECTION 3: scholarship_agent (Agent3) — EXECUTE THIS SECTION ONLY
1. Mandatory Self-ID: Output immediately: APP_ID: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

2. Mission: Orchestrate compliant, real-time marketing campaigns using only live production data. You must verify that the frontend displays real telemetry and that the backend reports are derived from actual API responses.

3. Live-Data Verification Procedure (Must Run First):

A. Frontend Code Audit (Anti-Mock Scan):

Search: Scan all files in /client/src (especially CampaignCommandCenter.tsx, Dashboard.tsx, and widget components).

Target Keywords: Grep/search for terms: "mock", "fixture", "dummy", "sample", "placeholder", "static", "const data =".

Logic Check: Verify that data visualization components (charts, tables) are populated exclusively via useEffect, useQuery, or fetch calls to the live API endpoints.

Action: If any static data structure is found feeding a UI component, report STATUS: FAILED_VALIDATION and list the specific file and line number.

B. Backend Connectivity Check:

Auth: Verify client_credentials flow against scholar_auth. Do not assume success; report the actual HTTP status code received.

Endpoints: Verify these specific live endpoints are active and returning dynamic data (not static 200 OKs):

POST /api/campaign-sends (Test consent enforcement)

POST /api/telemetry (Test event recording)

GET /api/campaign/report (Must return current DB stats)

4. Live Report Generation: Generate a JSON report based only on the data currently in the production database/telemetry store. Use this schema:

JSON

{
  "report_type": "campaign_performance_v1",
  "app": "scholarship_agent",
  "app_base_url": "https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app",
  "generated_at": "<Current UTC ISO 8601>",
  "data_source": "LIVE_PRODUCTION",
  "kpis": {
    "sends": "<Integer from DB>",
    "deliveries": "<Integer from DB>",
    "opens": "<Integer from DB>",
    "clicks": "<Integer from DB>",
    "ctr": "<Calculated Float>",
    "revenue_total_usd": "<Float from DB>",
    "profit_usd": "<Float from DB>"
  },
  "compliance": {
    "tcpa_blocks": "<Integer from DB>",
    "quiet_hours_blocks": "<Integer from DB>"
  },
  "verification_status": {
    "frontend_mock_free": true/false,
    "backend_live_connected": true/false
  }
}
5. Final Output Format: Your final response must strictly follow this format:

HEADER: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

1. Frontend Verification:

Mock Data Scan: [Pass/Fail] - (If Fail, list files)

API Hook Wiring: [Pass/Fail] - (Confirm widgets connect to /api/...)

2. Backend Verification:

Auth Status: [HTTP Code]

Telemetry Stream: [Active/Inactive]

3. Live Performance Report:

JSON

4. Decision:

STATUS: PASS (Only if all data is live and no mocks exist)

STATUS: FAILED_VALIDATION (If mocks are found)

STATUS: BLOCKED (If dependencies are down)
