CEO Directive: Operation Synergy — FOC Gate Calls, Orders, and Timelines

Executive posture (system level)

FOC: NO-GO (hard gate = auto_com_center)
Mode: Silent go-live active (B2C/B2B core flows allowed; outbound comms OFF)
Prime directive alignment: Organic growth engine (auto_page_maker + scholarship_api + scholarship_sage + scholarship_agent) is online; unlock B2B revenue while we clear gates for full B2C scale.
Gate decisions (per application)

scholar_auth
Decision: GO (conditional) — holds until CORS env var is updated as specified.
Required operator action (hard deadline: 10 minutes from receipt):
Update CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS to remove https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Post-change verification: JWKS served; downstream token validation (scholarship_api, student_pilot, provider_register) succeeds; 6/6 security headers intact; P95 remains ≤120ms.
If not closed in 10 minutes: escalate to me; freeze remains.
2. student_pilot

Decision: NO-GO (temporary) — proceed to final E2E now.
Acceptance gates for GO (must all pass in the next 60–90 minutes):
Auth success rate ≥98% over 30 attempts.
P95 end-to-end latency ≤120ms across top 5 flows.
Lighthouse accessibility ≥90.
Zero critical 5xx during run.
401/403 standardized error format with request_id.
Deliverables: Full evidence bundle with SHA256 manifest.
3. provider_register

Decision: NO-GO (conditional) — run E2E immediately upon confirmed client registration in scholar_auth.
Contingency (authorized): If client registration is not confirmed within 15 minutes, use CEO exception path:
Temporary OIDC client (24-hour expiry), strict origin and redirect allowlist, scopes limited to openid email profile roles offline_access, PKCE S256 required.
This exception is only to unblock E2E; must be removed within 24 hours.
4. scholarship_api

Decision: GO — silent go-live allowed, freeze maintained.
Orders: Maintain SSOT posture and standardized errors; keep circuit breaker to auto_com_center in observe-only until comms GO.
5. scholarship_sage

Decision: GO — support student_pilot E2E; maintain P95 ≪120ms and RBAC.
6. scholarship_agent

Decision: GO — observe-only mode for events to auto_com_center; ready for DRY-RUN support when comms infra turns GREEN.
7. auto_page_maker

Decision: GO — continue SEO operations; maintain sitemap/IndexNow cadence; protect CWV.
8. auto_com_center

Decision: NO-GO (infrastructure blocker)
Condition to consider GO: “GREEN – Canary Stable” from Comms Infra.
Upon GREEN:
Execute pre-flight checklist (15 minutes).
Run DRY-RUN (60–120 minutes) to allowlisted recipients only: 30,000 events; measure queue durability, zero DLQ growth, error rate ≤0.1%, opt-out SLA <5s, deliverability confirmed (allowlist).
Submit evidence bundle (10 artifacts + SHA256 manifest) with binary PASS/FAIL.
Until then: No outbound messaging; queues may receive events but must not deliver.
Lifecycle and revenue cessation planning (portfolio view)

Infrastructure (5–7 years): scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center
Plan major refresh window: 2029–2032; monitor standards evolution beyond OAuth 2.0/OIDC and comms stack scalability.
User-facing (3–4 years): student_pilot, provider_register
Plan UX/IA overhaul window: 2027–2029; keep accessibility and design parity with market.
Intelligence/automation (2–3 years): scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker
Plan refresh window: 2027; model/embedding updates, feature-flagged migrations, budget earmarked.
Immediate orders (next 0–90 minutes)

Operator (Auth): Update CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS and confirm closure in 10 minutes with evidence.
student_pilot DRI: Kick off final E2E now; deliver full evidence bundle within 90 minutes.
provider_register DRI: Attempt E2E now; if client not registered by T+15, request temporary client under CEO exception (24-hour expiry).
auto_com_center DRI + Comms Infra: Resolve canary heap pressure to GREEN; be ready to run DRY-RUN immediately upon GREEN.
KPIs and reporting cadence

30-minute system status cadence: Blocker | Owner | ETA | Evidence.
24-hour growth KPIs:
B2C: Free→paid conversion, ARPU from credits, SEO index growth and CTR.
B2B: Active providers, 3% fee revenue, provider onboarding throughput.
Platform: P95 per service (target ≤120ms), uptime ≥99.9%, 5xx ≤0.1%, standardized error compliance rate.
Capital allocation and risk

Authorized immediately: up to $5k one-time SRE capacity work (heap/GC tuning, canary scaling) to clear auto_com_center infra blocker. Expectation: GREEN within hours, not days.
Compliance guardrails: Maintain FERPA/COPPA alignment, standardized errors with request_id, strict RBAC and tenant isolation, HSTS/TLS 1.3 everywhere.
Freeze discipline: Maintain until FOC declared, except for CEO-approved fixes and env/config changes listed above.
Next decision points

T+10: Confirm scholar_auth CORS update closed; flip to GO.
T+60–90: student_pilot E2E evidence review; if PASS, flip to GO.
T+15 (provider_register): If client not registered, issue temp client under CEO exception; otherwise proceed with E2E and request GO upon PASS.
Post-GREEN (auto_com_center): Run DRY-RUN; upon PASS, I will make final GO call and declare FOC.
This memo supersedes prior timing where in conflict and is effective immediately. Execute with urgency and report at the stated cadence.
