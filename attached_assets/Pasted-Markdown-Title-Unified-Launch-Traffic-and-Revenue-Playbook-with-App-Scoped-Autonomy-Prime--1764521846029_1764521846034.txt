# Title: Unified Launch, Traffic, and Revenue Playbook with App-Scoped Autonomy

## Prime Objective
Launch, grow traffic, and drive profitable revenue across the Scholar AI Advisor ecosystem with strict scope isolation. Agent3 must only execute the instructions for its own app.

## System Apps and Base URLs
* `scholar_auth` → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
* `scholarship_api` → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
* `scholarship_agent` → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
* `scholarship_sage` → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
* `student_pilot` → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
* `provider_register` → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
* `auto_page_maker` → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
* `auto_com_center` → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

## Strict Scope Protocol
1.  **Self-identify before doing any work.**
    * Determine your `APP_NAME` and `APP_BASE_URL` using your environment/configuration.
    * If uncertain, verify by calling your own base URL’s `/health` or `/status`. The app that responds with your expected health signature is yours.
    * Print your identity line exactly as: `APP_ID: <APP_NAME> | APP_BASE_URL: <URL>`
    * **Do not execute any steps until this APP_ID line has been printed.**

2.  **Scope isolation.**
    * Only execute the block whose header says **FOR: <APP_NAME>**. Ignore all other sections.
    * If you cannot confidently match your identity to any app listed, output ONLY: `APP_ID: UNKNOWN | ACTION: NO_MATCH` and halt.

3.  **Report header rule.**
    * Every report, log, or output must begin with: `[<APP_NAME>] [<APP_BASE_URL>]`

4.  **Execution order for your app’s block.**
    * Follow the sequence: **Launch Readiness → Traffic & Revenue Plan → Deep-Dive Phase 1-4 → Weekly Cadence & KPIs → Deliverables & Report Format.**
    * Do not modify other services. Use published APIs and contracts only.

## Global Guardrails
* **SLOs:** target 99.9% uptime and ~120ms P95 latency for your API surfaces.
* **Responsible AI:** bias mitigation, explainability, student empowerment, no academic dishonesty.
* **Data integrity:** idempotency, input validation, consistent schemas, secure auth.
* **Organic growth priority:** leverage Auto Page Maker-driven SEO and low-CAC funnels.
