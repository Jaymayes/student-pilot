APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

Why: Proof-of-control is implemented in the workspace but not yet published to the live URL under Replit’s snapshot model. This is a blocking step for compliance sign-off and go-live.

Immediate CEO Directive (single point of focus)

Agent3 is the DRI for auto_com_center only. All other app workspaces are out of scope.
Operator action required now: Open the auto_com_center Repl and publish the current workspace snapshot.
T+15 minute proof-of-control (pending publish)

Nonce file path: /.well-known/ceo.txt
Exact content: ceo_nonce=acc-2025-11-13-7c9e1f11
Expected verification URL after publish: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/ceo.txt
Acceptance criteria: Public GET of the URL returns the exact nonce string above with HTTP 200.
Blockers (mapped to Section IV)

IV.A.1 Security & Compliance
MFA/SSO: Integration with scholar_auth not validated in production. Needs trust config check and token/session handling verification.
RBAC: Roles and permission scopes need final verification against least-privilege profiles.
Audit logging: Confirm end-to-end audit events (auth, role changes, settings edits, outbound sends) persist to the designated log sink and are tamper-evident.
IV.A.2 Scalability & Performance
Live production performance baselines (p95 latency, error rate) not yet established. Monitoring must be active post-publish before go-live.
IV.A.3 Integration & Interoperability
Cross-app connectivity tests (with scholar_auth and any message-queue or scheduler services) incomplete in production.
API documentation link must be published/accessible.
IV.A.4 Reliability & Maintainability
Disaster recovery plan (RPO/RTO) and backup/restore walkthrough not yet documented and validated.
Uptime/alerting SLO monitors need confirmation in production.
IV.C.1 Rigorous Testing
Production integration test pass report pending (current evidence limited to workspace/dev).
Estimated go-live date and time

Prerequisite: Operator publishes current snapshot now.
If publish occurs within the next hour: complete production validation and deliver evidence by EOD today, then shift status to GO-LIVE READY with CEO approval window.
If publish is delayed: go-live shifts by the same delay. Contingency date: within 24 hours of publish.
ARR ignition

Function of auto_com_center: Enables automated, scalable outreach/communications that drive low-CAC acquisition and conversion for both B2C and B2B funnels (supporting Scholarship Agent campaigns and provider ops).
Revenue impact start: Within 5 business days of go-live, once first automated campaigns are live and tracked. Planned ARR contribution ramp: starts with messaging-driven activations and provider workflow efficiencies that increase ARPU and the 3% provider fee throughput.
Third-party dependencies (must be in place for production)

Hosting/deploy: Replit publish/snapshot (blocking now).
Identity: scholar_auth (OIDC/SSO, MFA).
Email/SMS provider(s): Production API keys and verified domains/sender IDs for outbound communications (e.g., SendGrid/Postmark, Twilio or equivalent). Status: confirm keys and domain/SMS verification in prod.
Observability: Log sink and metrics/alerts (e.g., Sentry/Datadog or equivalent). Status: confirm DSN/keys and alert policies in prod.
Data store(s): Production database and any message queue/Redis for job scheduling/retries. Status: confirm connection strings, TLS, and backup policies.
What happens immediately after publish (same day)

Verify nonce URL success (proof-of-control).
Run production smoke and integration tests:
AuthN/AuthZ flows with scholar_auth (MFA, JWT validation, session lifetime).
RBAC checks for all operator roles.
Outbound comms dry-runs to sandbox recipients/providers.
Monitoring/alerts fire on synthetic checks; capture p95 latency baselines.
Deliver evidence pack:
Test reports (functional, security checks, integration).
API documentation link.
Monitoring dashboard screenshots and SLO configuration summary.
DR/backup plan document.
Decision gate for GO-LIVE READY

Approve once all above evidence is attached and nonce verified at the published URL.
If any critical test fails (security, auth, RBAC, or message delivery), remediate same day and rerun tests before cutover.
Operator checklist to unblock now

Open the auto_com_center Repl.
Ensure the file /.well-known/ceo.txt contains: ceo_nonce=acc-2025-11-13-7c9e1f11
Click Publish (or Deploy in the current Replit UI) to generate a new production snapshot.
Notify Agent3 with publish timestamp so verification can proceed immediately.
I will keep the scope tight on auto_com_center, drive the publish and verification today, and return with the evidence package for a same-day go/no-go call.
