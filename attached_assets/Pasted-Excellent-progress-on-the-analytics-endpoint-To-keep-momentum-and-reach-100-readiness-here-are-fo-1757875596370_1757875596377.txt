Excellent progress on the analytics endpoint. To keep momentum and reach 100% readiness, here are focused, copy-paste prompts you can run in sequence. They separate change operations from verification and keep strict gates.

Security Parity Fix — Change Ticket (controlled change) Goal: Serve /.well-known/security.txt as text/plain with required fields, without regressing headers or performance.
Security Parity Fix — Change Ticket
Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Controlled change with rollback plan

Scope

Implement correct content-type for /.well-known/security.txt (text/plain; charset=utf-8)
Required file content (minimum):
Contact: security@scholarshipai.com
Acknowledgments: https://scholarshipai.com/security
Policy: https://scholarshipai.com/security-policy
Preserve existing HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options headers.
Pre-change checklist

Capture current response headers and body hash for /.well-known/security.txt (evidence IDs).
Confirm backup/rollback path for route/static asset config.
Execution

Update route or static asset serving to return Content-Type: text/plain.
Ensure no framework-level HTML wrapper or templating is applied.
Verification (must PASS before closing)

GET /.well-known/security.txt returns 200 and Content-Type: text/plain; body contains required fields.
No change to HSTS/CSP/XFO/XCTO on root and primary dashboards.
P95 latency for /.well-known/security.txt ≤ 100ms.
Rollback trigger

If content-type ≠ text/plain or headers regress, roll back immediately and attach evidence.
Outputs to return

Evidence: request/response header capture IDs, file checksum, timestamp, and P95 latency snapshot.
2. Read-Only Security Parity Verification — No changes
Goal: Prove the fix is correct and stable.

Read-Only Security Parity Verification — ScholarshipAI Student Pilot
Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Strict read-only

Checks

/.well-known/security.txt → 200, Content-Type: text/plain; contains required fields; body SHA256.
Root and dashboards retain HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options.
Endpoint health table: /health, /sitemap.xml, /.well-known/security.txt with status, last-seen P95, last error, evidence ID.
Output

5–7 bullet executive summary with PASS/WARN/FAIL.
Evidence IDs (header captures, timestamps).
JSON payload with fields: {security_txt: {status, content_type, sha256, evidence: []}, headers: {...}, endpoints: [...]}
3. Performance SLO Consolidation — Read-only verification for remaining endpoints
Goal: Confirm all public dashboards meet interim SLOs; identify any regressions.

Performance SLO Consolidation — Read-Only Verification
Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Strict read-only

Targets

Interim: P95 ≤ 250ms and error rate ≤ 1.0% for last 24h.
Final: P95 ≤ 120ms and error rate ≤ 0.1% (plan required if not yet met).
Endpoints to evaluate

/api/analytics/ttv-dashboard
/api/dashboard/security
/api/dashboard/stats
/api/dashboard/infrastructure
/health, /sitemap.xml
Required evidence

P50/P95/P99 and error rate by endpoint; last 24h window (or closest available).
Top-3 latency contributors per slow endpoint (e.g., auth, DB query, render).
Current caching status and hit rate if available.
Output

Table of endpoints with p50/p95/p99, error_rate%, status (PASS/WARN/FAIL), evidence IDs.
JSON payload summarizing metrics and status per endpoint.
Note: If any endpoint ≥250ms P95 or error rate >1.0%, include specific remediation step and owner.

4. Analytics and ARR Observability Restoration — Change-allowed, guarded
Goal: Eliminate UNKNOWNs for MAU, conversion, ARPU, and ARR so we can leave RED.

Analytics + ARR Restoration — Change Ticket (guarded)
Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Controlled changes with explicit verification and rollback

Scope

Backend: Ensure analytics endpoints never return null for required fields; return numeric (0 allowed) and include is_estimate flags.
Frontend: Add null-safety guards to TtvDashboardTile and related components; no crashes on partial data.
Revenue: Expose read-only ARR summary (B2C/B2B/Total) via protected endpoint or daily cached report with fields:
timestamp, arr_b2c_usd, arr_b2b_usd, arr_total_usd, report_id, data_freshness_minutes.
Verification (all must PASS)

API payloads show non-null numeric values for MAU(28d,90d), conversion_rate_pct, arpu_usd, medianTTV, p95TTV.
Dashboard renders without exceptions; trace IDs attached.
ARR summary returns numeric values with freshness ≤ 24h.
Rollback

If any endpoint returns null or the dashboard throws, revert the change and attach trace/error IDs.
Outputs

Evidence IDs: sample payloads, dashboard traces, ARR report ID, timestamps.
5. 24-hour Stability Gate — Read-only go/no-go to move from RED to YELLOW
Goal: Prove stability across measurement and performance for 24h.

24h Stability Gate — Read-Only Go/No-Go
Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Strict read-only

Pass criteria (all required)

No schema-missing errors for 24h.
Analytics metrics (MAU, conversion, ARPU, medianTTV, p95TTV) non-null, dashboards stable.
ARR summary accessible with freshness ≤ 24h.
SLOs: P95 ≤ 250ms and error rate ≤ 1.0% for all critical endpoints.
Security parity: security.txt correct with text/plain; headers intact.
Output

Executive summary with decision Red/Yellow.
KPI table and endpoint table with evidence IDs.
JSON payload of metrics and statuses.
6. Final 100% Readiness Certification — Read-only GREEN gate
Goal: Certify full readiness against final SLOs and governance.

100% Readiness Certification — Read-Only GREEN Gate
Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Strict read-only

Pass criteria (all required)

SLOs: P95 ≤ 120ms and error rate ≤ 0.1% sustained for 24h.
Measurement: No UNKNOWNs; analytics and ARR metrics populated and stable.
Security: security.txt text/plain; headers intact.
Observability: Dashboards live; alerts configured for schema errors, latency, error rate, ARR freshness.
SEO: Sitemap valid; no critical XML errors.
Output

Green/Yellow/Red with justification; evidence IDs for each criterion.
JSON payload capturing final state and alerts configuration references.
What to return after each prompt

A concise executive summary with PASS/WARN/FAIL.
Evidence IDs (log names, timestamps, trace IDs, payload samples).
If anything is UNKNOWN or FAIL, include the minimal next action, owner, and ETA.
This sequence should take you from your current partial SLO success to full measurement, security parity, stability, and finally 100% readiness.
