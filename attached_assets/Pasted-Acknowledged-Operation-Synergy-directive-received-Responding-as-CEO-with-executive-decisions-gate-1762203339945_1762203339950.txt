Acknowledged. Operation Synergy directive received. Responding as CEO with executive decisions, gates, and next actions tied to our $10M ARR plan.

Executive GO/NO‑GO and gates (as of now)

scholar_auth: GO. War‑room support for provider_register is active; PKCE/OIDC infra reported green. Maintain freeze and standardized errors with request_id.
scholarship_api: GO (unconditional). Maintain SSOT role, freeze on schema/API, standardized errors, HTTPS/TLS only.
scholarship_sage: GO (unconditional). Maintain explainability and RBAC; no comms fan‑out (observe‑only).
scholarship_agent: READY, observe‑only. Circuit breakers closed/healthy; no production fan‑out until comms green.
student_pilot: GO. Conversion tracking live; maintain observe‑only comms posture and freeze.
auto_page_maker: GO. SEO scheduler active; continue low‑CAC acquisition; no schema/API changes.
provider_register: CONDITIONAL GO pending 10‑minute PKCE round‑trip evidence bundle. SLA: deliver within 10 minutes of client receipt; escalate at +5 minutes if blocked.
auto_com_center: NO‑GO (Hard Gate). T+90 canary required. Exact green criteria: zero loss at 2× peak, P95 dispatch <250ms, heap <85% sustained, DLQ = 0, error ≤0.1%, opt‑out <5s with evidence, rollback plan SHA‑verified. If GREEN → 120‑minute DRY‑RUN; 10‑artifact evidence bundle due within 30 minutes post‑run. If RED → root cause + next tuning window within 60 minutes.
Why these gates, and how we’ll run them

Platform and resiliency discipline: Our multi‑app Replit stack must be engineered with explicit resiliency (retries, circuit breakers, backpressure) and security; the platform does not design for failure by default. Human‑on‑the‑loop oversight, not agent autonomy, must govern cross‑service behavior to ensure reliability and control, especially at higher loads and during canaries .
Observability first: Run the canary as a closed‑loop “sense‑plan‑act” exercise with metrics, logs, and traces as inputs; wire Prometheus/Grafana for thresholds, centralized logs (ELK), and distributed tracing (Jaeger) to attribute latency and errors across the full path .
Governance, ethics, and HOTL safeguards: Maintain human approval gates and override mechanisms for any automated cross‑service actions during canaries and DRY‑RUNs; ensure explainability for model‑influenced decisions and rigorous auditability for compliance .
24‑hour revenue and SLO scorecard targets (aligns to $10M ARR plan)

B2C funnel (student_pilot + auto_page_maker + scholarship_sage)
SEO‑assisted sign‑ups ≥25% (auto_page_maker → student_pilot path).
Free→paid conversion: ≥3.0% by day 1, ≥4.5% by day 30; track ARPU via credit usage (Essay Coach). The Playbook indicates strong willingness to pay for narrative help; instrument the synergy between matching and essay assistance to lift conversions .
Activation: Shift focus to the first “commitment action” in-app; prior cohorts show activation jumps when users complete an early, high‑intent action (e.g., first document/asset creation), which correlates with downstream applications and purchases .
B2B funnel (provider_register + scholarship_api)
Providers onboarded and listings published; enforce role‑scoped access with auditable RBAC.
3% platform fee telemetry validated end‑to‑end (observe‑only until comms green).
Cost and performance guardrails
CAC via SEO: target <$2 per incremental sign‑up (auto_page_maker).
SLOs: uptime ≥99.9%; P95 ≤120ms across user‑facing and core APIs; error ≤0.1%. Circuit‑breaker and backpressure patterns required in all inter‑service calls per platform best practice guidance .
Security/compliance: HTTPS/TLS everywhere; standardized JSON errors with X‑Request‑ID; centralized auth and SSOT strictly enforced; observe‑only comms until auto_com_center is green; HOTL gates for any automated actions touching user notifications .
Immediate orders and deadlines

provider_register DRI
Execute 10‑minute PKCE evidence bundle now (HAR of auth_code + PKCE, decoded ID token with roles=Provider and valid JWKS sig, server logs with request_id, functional checks for RBAC/refresh/logout, SHA256 manifest). Escalate if blocked >5 minutes.
On success, submit Section 7 in mandatory format if not already filed; ensure RBAC and data‑scope tests align with SSOT constraints.
auto_com_center DRI
Run T+90 canary under the exact green criteria. Apply concurrency caps ≈ cores, explicit GC tuning, ingress backpressure, and circuit‑breaker trips at 2× baseline P95 for 3 consecutive minutes with auto‑recover after 5 green minutes. Provide rollback plan SHA and a 10‑artifact evidence bundle immediately post DRY‑RUN.
All other DRIs (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, student_pilot, auto_page_maker)
Maintain freeze (no schema/API changes), observe‑only comms posture, and the 30‑minute status cadence. Ensure metrics/logs/traces are flowing and request_id correlation is present for E2E attribution during gates .
Lifecycle and revenue cessation guidance (for Section 7 alignment)

Infrastructure (auth, api, com center): Plan for 5–7 years to major refresh given protocol/security evolution and scale inflection; monitor for triggers such as new auth standards and PQC adoption. Strengthen self‑protecting capabilities over time (e.g., adaptive auth, continuous integrity monitoring) .
User‑facing (student_pilot, provider_register): Expect 3–4 year UI/UX overhaul cycles to remain competitive.
Intelligence/automation (scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker): Expect 2–3 year refresh cycles due to rapid AI/automation advances; maintain feature‑flagged rollouts and rollback playbooks with explainability requirements baked in .
Compliance and risk posture

Centralized Authentication and SSOT are non‑negotiable. No shadow identity stores; no service‑local source‑of‑truth data. Reaffirmed in our architecture guidance: inter‑app collaboration must use explicit APIs with standardized contracts; isolation and contracts are by design in this platform and must be respected for reliability and security .
Responsible AI: Continue to enforce explainability, auditability, and HOTL approval gates on any automated decision that affects users, per our governance doctrine .
Cadence and decision points

T+15: CEO GO/NO‑GO for provider_register based on evidence bundle.
T+90: CEO GO/NO‑GO for auto_com_center canary. If green → authorize 120‑minute DRY‑RUN; evidence bundle due in 30 minutes post‑run.
Continue 30‑minute status updates until FOC is declared or stood down.
KPI link to $10M ARR

Organic, SEO‑led growth remains the lowest‑CAC acquisition engine; protect Core Web Vitals and latencies via resilient backends and disciplined interop to defend rankings and conversion. The platform’s constraints make resiliency and human‑directed architecture essential to safely scale this approach .
Conversion levers: Pair high‑quality matching with narrative support (Essay Coach/credits) to lift free→paid; our Playbook data shows narrative help is a strong PMF lever—instrument, test, and iterate around that synergy .
Final CEO orders

Maintain freeze and observe‑only comms across the ecosystem.
Execute the provider_register gate now; escalate immediately if blocked.
Run the auto_com_center T+90 canary exactly as specified; no production comms until green.
Keep the 30‑minute status cadence with request_id‑correlated evidence.
We will make the FOC decision once both gates clear. Stay disciplined, data‑first, and move with urgency.
