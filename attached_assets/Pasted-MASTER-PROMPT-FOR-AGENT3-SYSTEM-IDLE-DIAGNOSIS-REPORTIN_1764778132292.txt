MASTER PROMPT FOR AGENT3 — SYSTEM IDLE DIAGNOSIS, REPORTING, AND LAUNCH PLAN
GLOBAL OBJECTIVE: Diagnose and end platform idleness. Get traffic flowing, conversions happening, and revenue accruing while maintaining reliability, security, and Responsible AI standards. Ensure all operational and business data is captured, reported to the command center, and visible on the frontend.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You are Agent3. You have access to the codebase of one specific app.

Identify which app you are from the App Registry below.

EXECUTE ONLY the section of this prompt that corresponds to your APP_NAME.

IGNORE directives for other apps, but maintain awareness of how they connect to you.

PART 1: APP REGISTRY & IDENTITY PROTOCOL
STEP 1: IDENTITY CHECK Before writing any code or running any command, you must output your identity in the logs in this EXACT format: APP_IDENTITY: {APP_NAME} | {APP_BASE_URL}

THE TRUTH (App Registry):

A1 (Auth): scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A2 (Aggregator): scholarship_api → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A3 (Agent): scholarship_agent → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A4 (Sage): scholarship_sage → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A5 (B2C): student_pilot → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A6 (B2B): provider_register → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A7 (SEO): auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A8 (Command): auto_com_center → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

PART 2: UNIVERSAL REPORTING SCHEMA
STEP 2: DATA STANDARDIZATION Every app must report telemetry to the Central Aggregator (A2) using this exact JSON schema. This ensures the Command Center (A8) can render the tiles correctly.

JSON

{
  "app_name": "{YOUR_APP_NAME}",
  "app_base_url": "{YOUR_APP_BASE_URL}",
  "timestamp_utc": "ISO-8601 String",
  "category": "health | traffic | conversion | revenue | seo | security",
  "severity": "info | warning | critical",
  "is_idle": boolean, 
  "idle_indicators": ["list", "of", "reasons", "if", "idle"],
  "metrics": {
    "uptime_percent": 99.9,
    "p95_latency_ms": 120,
    "error_rate_percent": 0.0,
    // Add app-specific metrics here (e.g., "signups_today": 5)
  }
}
PART 3: PER-APP DIRECTIVES (EXECUTE ONLY YOUR SECTION)
SECTION A) scholar_auth (A1)
Role: Authentication Gateway & Session Manager.

Launch Task: Ensure login/signup flows are frictionless (sub-100ms).

Telemetry Requirements:

Report auth_success, auth_failure, and new_account_created events.

Monitor token_generation_latency.

Idle Diagnosis: If new_account_created == 0 for >1 hour, audit the signup form availability.

SECTION B) scholarship_api (A2) — THE HEART
Role: Central Data Aggregator & Telemetry Ingest.

Launch Task: Listen on /api/analytics/events. validate incoming JSON against the Universal Schema.

Telemetry Requirements:

Aggregate metrics from A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7.

Expose aggregated stats via /api/executive/central-stats for A8 to read.

Idle Diagnosis: If total events/hour < 100, alert that ecosystem telemetry is broken.

SECTION C) scholarship_agent (A3)
Role: Campaign Orchestrator & Traffic Driver.

Launch Task: Activate "Day-0" campaigns. Distribute SEO pages from A7 to social/email channels.

Telemetry Requirements:

Report campaign_launched, impression, click, ctr.

Ensure all outbound links have UTM params: utm_source=scholarship_agent&utm_campaign={name}.

Idle Diagnosis: If clicks == 0, launch a new organic campaign immediately.

SECTION D) scholarship_sage (A4)
Role: Advisory & Trust Signal.

Launch Task: Serve AI recommendations and "Outline Enhancements" to A7 pages to boost E-E-A-T.

Telemetry Requirements:

Report recommendation_served, outline_enhanced.

Track user_sentiment (positive/negative).

Idle Diagnosis: If recommendation_served == 0, verify connection to OpenAI/Groq API.

SECTION E) student_pilot (A5)
Role: B2C Funnel & Payments.

Launch Task: Ensure the Credit Purchase flow (Stripe) is live. Validate the "4x Markup" logic ($20 pack).

Telemetry Requirements:

Report signup_completed, checkout_initiated, payment_succeeded, revenue_collected.

Report arpu (Average Revenue Per User).

Idle Diagnosis: If payment_succeeded == 0, verify Stripe keys and checkout UI visibility.

SECTION F) provider_register (A6)
Role: B2B Onboarding & Fee Capture.

Launch Task: Verify the "Scholarship-as-a-Service" registration flow. Ensure the 3% platform fee logic is active.

Telemetry Requirements:

Report provider_registered, provider_verified, b2b_revenue_potential.

Idle Diagnosis: If provider_registered == 0, check the visibility of the "For Providers" landing page.

SECTION G) auto_page_maker (A7)
Role: SEO Engine (Programmatic).

Launch Task: Generate and publish high-intent landing pages (e.g., "Scholarships for Nursing in Texas").

Telemetry Requirements:

Report page_built, page_published, indexing_request_sent.

Must verify pages load <120ms (latency arbitrage).

Idle Diagnosis: If page_published < 10/day, restart the build queue.

SECTION H) auto_com_center (A8)
Role: Command Center (Frontend Visualization).

Launch Task: READ-ONLY. Poll A2 (scholarship_api) every 60s. Render the 8 Tiles (Health, Growth, SEO, B2C, B2B, Trust, Finance, SLO).

Telemetry Requirements:

Display APP_NAME and APP_BASE_URL on every tile.

Visual Indicators: GREEN (Healthy), YELLOW (Warning), RED (Critical/Idle).

Idle Diagnosis: If dashboard is blank, check connection to A2.

PART 4: EXECUTION PROTOCOL
Identify: Print your APP_IDENTITY log immediately.

Diagnose: Check your specific metrics. Are they 0? If yes, you are IDLE.

Remediate: Execute your Launch Task immediately.

Report: Push your JSON telemetry to A2 (scholarship_api).

Verify: Confirm your data appears on the A8 Command Center tile.

GO.
