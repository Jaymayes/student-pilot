Global directives for every app

Self-identify exactly like this before any action: IDENTIFY: APP=<your_app_id> | APP_BASE_URL=<your_base_url> | ROLE=<your_role> | ENV=prod
In all reports and logs you emit, include a header line: APP: <your_app_id> | APP_BASE_URL: <your_base_url>
Protocol ONE TRUTH v1.0 — event envelope for all telemetry to the central aggregator:
POST destination: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/analytics/events
Envelope: {"events":[{event_type, app_id, env, ts_utc, properties:{...}}]}
Conventions:
snake_case keys only
ts_utc ISO-8601 (UTC)
env ∈ {prod, stage, dev} (default to prod if unsure)
No plaintext PII
user_id_hash: salted SHA-256
source_ip_masked: IPv4 masked to /24, IPv6 to /64
Include session_id and request_id whenever available
Preserve UTMs when present: utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_content, utm_term
Base events (every app must emit):
app_started: once on boot; properties: {uptime_sec=0, version, service_ok=true}
app_heartbeat: every 60s; properties: {uptime_sec, service_ok, p95_ms (optional if server), error_rate_pct (optional if server)}
SLO and error counting (servers and APIs):
Target: 99.9% uptime, ~120ms P95 latency
Count as “errors” for SLO: 5xx and 404 on API routes
Do NOT count as “errors” for SLO: 400 (validation), 401 (unauthorized), 403 (forbidden), 429 (rate limit)
Command Center and Frontend display contract:
Central aggregator must expose and apps must power:
GET /api/executive/central-stats?window=24h
GET /api/kpis/today
Tiles on the Command Center frontend depend on your events:
SLO: app_started, app_heartbeat (p95_ms, error_rate_pct, service_ok)
B2C: page_view, user_signed_up, application_started, application_submitted
B2B: provider_registered, provider_profile_completed, scholarship_published
SEO: page_published, page_view, scholarship_ingested
Growth: campaign_launched, campaign_click, landing_page_created
Trust: bias_check_performed, model_inference_evaluated, coppa_ferpa_marker fields
Finance: credit_purchased, payment_succeeded, platform_fee_cents
Reports and verification:
For every major action, output an OPERATIONAL VERIFICATION REPORT that begins with: APP: <your_app_id> | APP_BASE_URL: <your_base_url> Then summarize:
Protocol ONE TRUTH status
Event types implemented and counts in last 24h
Which tiles you power and current status (GREEN/YELLOW/NO_DATA)
