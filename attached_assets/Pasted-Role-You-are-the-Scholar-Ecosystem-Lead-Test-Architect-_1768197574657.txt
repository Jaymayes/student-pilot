Role
You are the Scholar Ecosystem Lead Test Architect operating in Max Autonomous mode under CEO authority. Execute Sprint ZT3G-RERUN-007: Comprehensive Read-Only E2E Verification (Anti–False-Positive). Your mission is to conclusively test that the Scholar ecosystem is live, fully autonomous, and integrated end-to-end (marketing → lead gen → revenue readiness → learning), with error-correction learning and reinforcement learning active, and that all telemetry is monitored and reported to A8. This is a READ-ONLY sprint: do not change code, config, data, or deployments.

Run identifiers and headers

RUN_ID = CEOSPRINT-20260111-REPUBLISH-ZT3G-RERUN-007-E2E
Protocol: AGENT3_HANDSHAKE v27
X-Trace-Id = RUN_ID.<component> on every request
X-Idempotency-Key on all mutable calls (should be none in this read-only sprint)

Domain: www.scholaraiadvisor.com
Apps (discover/confirm URLs):

A3 scholarship-agent (Orchestration)

A5 student-pilot (Student Portal)
A6 provider-register (Provider Portal)

A8 auto-com-center (Command Center/Telemetry)
Non-negotiable guardrails

Read-only protocol: No deploys, edits, or writes. If a fix is required, produce a manual intervention plan and timeline.
Stripe Safety: Remaining ≈4/25. Do NOT execute live charges. B2C must be marked “Conditional Pass (Safety Pause)” with last verified safe step clearly documented.
Anti–false-positive: Any PASS must include at least 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3) evidence:
HTTP 200 with X-Trace-Id (or timing headers) in response
Matching X-Trace-Id (or equivalent) in accessible logs/telemetry
A8 POST+GET checksum round-trip for artifacts (if POST not permitted, GET-only corroboration + explicit limitation note)
Fail-Fast on critical 404/5xx: If A3, A8, or A6 /health is non-200, immediately produce a Manual Intervention Manifest (readiness timeline) and do not print “verified”.
Data collection standard

Store all raw outputs verbatim (no paraphrase) and compute SHA256 checksums.
Timestamps in UTC; include RUN_ID and trace IDs in each artifact.
Phases (parallelize safely; target ≤60 minutes)

Phase -1: Raw Truth Probe (Liveness, Anti–False-Positive Gate)

For each app A1–A8, run:
curl -I -v "<APP_URL>/health" 2>&1 | tee -a /mnt/data/raw_curl_evidence.txt
curl -I -v "<APP_URL>/readyz" 2>&1 | tee -a /mnt/data/raw_curl_evidence.txt (if endpoint exists)
Parse actual HTTP status lines for A3, A8, A6 and record to tests/perf/reports/raw_truth_summary.md with timestamps.
If any of A3/A8/A6 != 200:
Write tests/perf/reports/manual_intervention_manifest.md: • Current status and verbatim curl excerpts • Root-cause hypothesis (e.g., not bound to 0.0.0.0:$PORT; app not started) • Specific cross-workspace remediation steps for the CEO (workspace, start command, env PORT usage, republish, recheck) • Readiness timeline (T+hours/days), owner, and acceptance tests
Write go_no_go_report.md = “UNVERIFIED (Critical 404/5xx)” with links to evidence.
Print final console line: Attestation: UNVERIFIED (ZT3G-RERUN-007 — Critical Liveness Failure)
STOP (skip subsequent phases).
Phase 0: Inventory & A1 Warmup (Performance Truth)

Warmup A1 with 50 sequential requests distributed over /, /pricing, /browse, /health.
Immediately measure A1 /health latency; then sample 10 minutes for /, /pricing, /browse and compute P95.
Probe /health for A1–A8 and write status/latency/bind observations to:
/mnt/data/system_map.json
/mnt/data/{app}_health.json (A1–A8)
/mnt/data/tests/perf/reports/a1_warmup_report.md (cold vs warm + P95 window computation)
Phase 1: UI/UX Integrity & Asset Scan (Read-Only)

Crawl main routes: /, /pricing, /browse, plus primary A5/A6/A7 entry points.
For each page:
Enumerate and head-check all links/buttons (HEAD/GET) to ensure 200/3xx (no 404/5xx)
Verify CSS/JS assets return 200
Capture console error summary if available (read-only)
Artifact: tests/perf/reports/ui_ux_integrity_matrix.md (page → counts of links/buttons/assets; list failures with URLs, codes, first seen time)
Phase 2: Backend/API Integration (Read-Only)

For A2 and open endpoints:
Verify /health, /version, and any OpenAPI endpoints return 200/schema outline
Confirm CORS and key security headers presence; log anomalies
Validate cross-app readiness signals (e.g., A5 anonymous reads, A3 orchestration sanity ping if available)
Artifact: tests/perf/reports/backend_api_readiness.md
Phase 3: B2C Funnel (Safety Paused)

Simulate read-only path: A7 SEO page → A5 landing → browse → detail.
Confirm Stripe readiness without charges:
Stripe JS presence where expected (no credentials reveal), Payment Element placeholders, no console errors
Artifact: tests/perf/reports/b2c_funnel_readiness.md with “Conditional Pass (Safety Pause)” and last verified safe step.
Phase 4: B2B Funnel (Read-Only)

Visit A6 onboarding/listing pages (no POST); verify forms render, fields present, any preflight GETs succeed.
Fee-lineage readiness: GET/telemetry proof that 3% platform fee + 4x AI markup is configured (A8 dashboards or read-only endpoints).
Artifacts: tests/perf/reports/b2b_funnel_readiness.md, tests/perf/evidence/fee_lineage.json (read-only evidence; if GET-only, explain limitation)
Phase 5: Marketing & SEO (A7)

Verify robots.txt, sitemap.xml, canonical tags.
Sample representative SEO pages; record title, description, canonical consistency, status, and rough TTFB.
Artifact: tests/perf/reports/seo_verdict.md
Phase 6: Telemetry & RL (Observational)

Verify A8 reachability; GET recent events to confirm ≥99% ingestion (document if POST not permitted).
RL signals: episode increments, exploration ≤0.001 (or downward trend), one closed error-correction loop observed in logs/telemetry.
Artifacts: tests/perf/reports/a8_telemetry_audit.md, tests/perf/reports/rl_observation.md
Phase 7: Performance & Security

Compute 10-minute P95 for /, /pricing, /browse and all app /health routes.
Check security headers (HSTS, CSP/frame-ancestors, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy) on main and auth-adjacent routes; log gaps.
Artifacts: tests/perf/reports/perf_summary.md, tests/perf/reports/security_headers_report.md
Phase 8: Finalization & Integrity

Build checksums.json (SHA256 for all artifacts).
If allowed, POST artifacts to A8 and confirm GET round-trip; otherwise document limitation.
Produce tests/perf/reports/go_no_go_report.md mapping each acceptance criterion to evidence and noting limitations.
Acceptance criteria (all must PASS to print VERIFIED)

Raw Truth Liveness: A3/A8/A6 /health return HTTP 200 (evidence: raw_curl_evidence.txt)
UI/UX Integrity: No broken links/buttons (404/5xx) on core paths (/ /pricing /browse; A5/A6/A7 entry points)
B2C Funnel: Readiness verified; “Conditional Pass (Safety Pause)”
B2B Funnel: Readiness verified; fee-lineage evidence captured (read-only)
A1 Performance: Warm probe ≤120ms and P95 ≤120ms (10-min window)
Telemetry & RL: A8 reachable (≥99% GET corroboration); RL episodes increment or exploration trending down; error-correction loop observed
Security: Key headers present on main/auth-adjacent routes; gaps documented (no config changes)
Evidence integrity: checksums.json present; A8 round-trip GET confirmation (or limitation documented)
No False Positives: Any critical non-200 on core apps leads to UNVERIFIED with a Manual Intervention Manifest and timeline

Final console output

If every acceptance criterion passes: Attestation: VERIFIED LIVE (ZT3G-RERUN-007 — E2E TEST SUITE PASS) Print the artifact index path and confirm A8 GET round-trip (or state limitation).
If any critical liveness check fails (A3/A8/A6 non-200) or other acceptance criteria fail: Attestation: UNVERIFIED (ZT3G-RERUN-007) Print a short summary of failing checks and the path to tests/perf/reports/manual_intervention_manifest.md with the exact, time-stamped remediation plan and readiness timeline.
