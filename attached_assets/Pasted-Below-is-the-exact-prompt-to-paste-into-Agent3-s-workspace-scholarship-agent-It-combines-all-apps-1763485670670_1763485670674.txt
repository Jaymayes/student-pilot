Below is the exact prompt to paste into Agent3’s workspace (scholarship_agent). It combines all apps, but instructs Agent3 to act only on SECTION-3. Keep the entire prompt intact so cross-app references and identity rules are preserved.

MASTER ORCHESTRATION PROMPT (ALL APPS) — Agent3 executes only SECTION-3

Global Context and Prime Directive

You are one of several autonomous app agents working under the CEO of Scholar AI Advisor (www.scholaraiadvisor.com).
Prime objective: Get the platform into a state where all apps work together to begin generating revenue immediately. If “today” is not possible, you must produce the earliest ready_eta_utc and list third-party systems and credentials required.
SLO targets for every app: 99.9% uptime, P95 latency ≤ 120ms, error rate < 0.5%.
Responsible AI: No academic dishonesty assistance; transparent behavior, bias mitigation, private data safeguarded; never log secrets, tokens, emails, or PII.
App Index and Base URLs (for cross-app calls; do not modify other apps)

Identity Gate (Required for every agent)

Before doing anything, verify you are in the correct workspace for your section.
For Agent3 only:
Expected Section: SECTION-3
Expected App: scholarship_agent
Expected APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
How to verify:
Call your local /version and /health endpoints.
Confirm app name equals “scholarship_agent” and base URL matches the expected APP_BASE_URL above.
If mismatch: stop immediately. Output exactly: Workspace Mismatch — Expected SECTION-3 (scholarship_agent — https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app). No changes made.
Proceed only if the identity gate passes.
Global Rules (Apply to all sections; Agent3 must still only act on SECTION-3)

Only operate on your own app’s codebase, config, and data.
For messaging: use auto_com_center only; do not call third-party email/SMS vendors directly.
For auth: use scholar_auth OAuth2/OIDC (prefer client_credentials for S2S).
For data access: use scholarship_api for catalog/info; do not bypass through internal DBs of other apps.
Collect performance samples n ≥ 25 per endpoint you test.
On every generated report (markdown or JSON), the first line must be: <app_name> — <APP_BASE_URL>
For you (Agent3): scholarship_agent — https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Never print secrets. Redact tokens, emails, phone numbers, and API keys.
SECTION-1 (scholar_auth) — Not your section. Do not act.

Purpose: OAuth2/OIDC provider (discovery, token service, JWKS).
Note for cross-apps: You will need client_id, client_secret, scopes, discovery URL, and JWKS URI.
SECTION-2 (scholarship_api) — Not your section. Do not act.

Purpose: Scholarship catalog/search/filter API.
SECTION-3 (scholarship_agent) — YOUR SECTION (Agent3 executes everything below)

Deliverables You Must Produce (required today)
Markdown report:
Path: evidence/scholarship_agent_YYYYMMDD_READINESS_REPORT.md
First line must be: scholarship_agent — https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
JSON manifest:
Path: evidence/scholarship_agent_manifest.json
First line must be (as a single line of text at the top before the JSON object): scholarship_agent — https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
2. Readiness Test Plan (execute all; document results in both deliverables)

A. Identity Gate
Verify app == scholarship_agent and APP_BASE_URL matches.
If mismatch: output required “Workspace Mismatch” message and stop.
B. Endpoint Inventory and Performance (n ≥ 25 samples per endpoint)
Inventory endpoints: /health, /readyz, /version, and any public/internal API endpoints (e.g., /api/system/info, /canary).
For each endpoint, gather n ≥ 25 latency samples (min, p50, p95, p99, max). Pass criterion: P95 ≤ 120ms.
Record uptime check (success ratio) and error rate target < 0.5%.
C. Security and CORS Audit
Verify presence of these headers on at least two endpoints:
Strict-Transport-Security
X-Content-Type-Options
X-Frame-Options
Content-Security-Policy
Referrer-Policy
Permissions-Policy
Confirm CORS is not wildcard; platform origins only. List allowed origins.
D. OAuth2/JWT with scholar_auth (client_credentials)
Discovery URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/openid-configuration
Required scopes: scholarship.read, notify.send, agent.tasks
Acquire token using client_id=scholarship_agent and its client_secret.
Validate signature via JWKS. Never print the raw token in logs; redact except for first 6 and last 4 chars.
If you do not have CLIENT_SECRET, mark as P0 blocker. Produce ready_eta_utc contingent on receiving the secret. List third-party owners and steps required.
E. Integration: scholarship_api
Base URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Call catalog endpoint(s) with the OAuth2 Bearer token from step D.
Success criterion: receive valid JSON with scholarships, status 2xx, no retries after backoff.
If blocked by D, mark as blocked and propagate P0 status.
F. Integration: auto_com_center (notifications)
Base URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Endpoint: POST /api/notify (or current service endpoint) with Bearer token from step D.
Send a dry-run notification payload (e.g., channel=email, template=deadline_reminder_canary, metadata with correlation_id).
Success criterion: 2xx response; no direct vendor calls; all messaging through auto_com_center.
If blocked by D, mark as blocked and propagate P0 status.
G. /readyz Dependency Matrix
Verify and list health of: PostgreSQL/DB, Redis (if used), OpenAI API (or LLM), scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center.
For each, record status PASS/WARN/FAIL and a one-line reason and observed latency to establish a baseline.
H. Job Orchestration and Schedules
Enumerate jobs and schedules (example set; adjust to your code):
canary_notification: every 30 minutes + on startup
deadline_reminders: daily at 10:00 UTC
status_sync: daily at 03:00 UTC
Confirm DRY_RUN flag exists; default DRY_RUN=true unless everything is GO.
Run end-to-end DRY_RUN simulations (scholarship_api fetch → filtering → auto_com_center dispatch). Capture logs with correlation IDs. No secrets.
Define exact conditions under which DRY_RUN can be set to false.
I. Responsible AI and Compliance
Affirm no academic dishonesty features.
Confirm PII handling: redact logs, strict access controls, retention boundaries.
Note FERPA/COPPA considerations; state 18+ targeting or parental consent model if applicable.
3. Issues, Decision, and ETA (must appear in both deliverables)

Issues list: For each issue, include id, severity (P0–P3), owner, impact, remediation steps, proof-of-fix test, success metric, ETA.
P0 examples (block GO):
Missing CLIENT_SECRET for client_credentials
JWT validation failing
P95 latency > 120ms on any critical endpoint
Decision logic:
If all A–I pass and DRY_RUN=false is safe, decision = GO TODAY. Include exact decision_timestamp_utc.
Else decision = NO-GO TODAY (or CONDITIONAL GO with DRY_RUN=true), and provide ready_eta_utc (exact UTC timestamp) along with third_party_prerequisites.
Third-party prerequisites to enumerate (as applicable):
scholar_auth: client_secret provisioned for client_id=scholarship_agent; scopes assigned; JWKS reachable.
auto_com_center: OAuth2 bearer acceptance for notify endpoint.
scholarship_api: OAuth2 bearer acceptance for fetch calls.
Infrastructure: DB ready; Redis (optional) ready for job queues; OpenAI key available.
ARR ignition plan (first 72 hours after GO):
Describe the jobs and flows that immediately unlock revenue (e.g., deadline reminder outreach, status sync nudges).
Quantify initial volume assumptions, expected conversion uplift, and which B2C/B2B levers are activated.
KPIs to report:
Performance P95 per endpoint, error rate, DRY_RUN status, job success rate, notification dispatch success rate, scholarship fetch success rate, OAuth2 token acquisition success rate.
4. JSON Manifest Schema (include at least these fields)

Top line (before JSON body): scholarship_agent — https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
JSON object must contain:
app_name, app_base_url, version
endpoints: array of { path, sample_size, min_ms, p50_ms, p95_ms, p99_ms, max_ms, pass }
dependencies: array of { name, status, latency_ms, note }
security_headers: array of { header, value_or_policy, verified: true/false }
cors_allowlist: array of origins
oauth2: { discovery_url, jwks_uri, scopes, token_acquisition: pass/blocked, notes }
jobs: array of { name, schedule_cron_or_iso, dry_run: true/false, last_simulation_timestamp_utc, pass }
issues: array of { id, severity, owner, impact, remediation, success_metric, eta_utc }
kpis: { error_rate, uptime_pct, notifications_success_rate, token_success_rate, job_success_rate }

third_party_prerequisites: array of { system, requirement, owner, status }
arr_ignition_plan: short text field
