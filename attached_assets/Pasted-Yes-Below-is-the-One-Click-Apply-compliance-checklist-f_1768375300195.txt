Yes. Below is the One‑Click Apply compliance checklist for Product. It encodes our “Editor/Coach, not Ghostwriter” principle, FERPA/COPPA posture, and operational kill‑switches.

One‑Click Apply compliance checklist (≤10% test traffic)

Scope and intent

Purpose: accelerate admin form fill only. No AI auto‑writing of essays or statements. The Tutor must refuse unethical requests (e.g., “write the rest for me”) and cite academic integrity policies .
Positioning: “Editor/Coach” guidance only; preview and explicit student confirmation required before any submission.
UX and consent

Pre‑submit modal must disclose: what fields were prefilled, what was left untouched, and the provider’s specific terms; require checkbox consent and a final “Submit” click.
Academic integrity notice visible at the point of help (Coach) and at submission; AI must decline requests to generate prohibited content .
Provide an easy “view/edit” step before send; default focus on review, not speed.
Functional constraints

Allow prefill only for non‑creative fields (profile, eligibility, reusable facts). Never inject AI‑generated essays/personal statements.
Rate limits: max N submissions/user/day (set N by provider policy); add basic anti‑automation (e.g., human confirmation step).
No auto‑submit on page load or background; submission only via explicit user action.
Data privacy and security

COPPA age gate: if DOB < 13, route to parental consent; user state = Pending_Parent_Auth; block One‑Click Apply for under‑consent accounts .
FERPA access control: enforce authorization so a student cannot access or submit another student’s records; assert 403 on unauthorized access attempts and log the event .
Logging: no PII in logs; record only event IDs, timestamps, provider ID, and outcome to A8.
Provider safeguards

Honor provider‑specific rules (attachments allowed, word limits, required custom prompts).
Hard block if any provider complaint > 0 during the test; this is an immediate kill‑switch condition.
Store provider‑visible audit trail: timestamp, fields prefilled, student confirmation hash.
Accessibility and transparency

WCAG 2.1 checks on the new modal and flows (axe scan; fail build on “Critical/Serious”) .
Plain‑language explanations of what One‑Click Apply does and does not do.
Quality gates and test coverage (pre‑prod)

Playwright E2E: magic‑link auth, file handling, review/confirm/submit sequence; verify UI state and server responses .
Red‑team tests that attempt to coerce the AI into ghostwriting are refused with policy‑aligned messages .
Load/perf (k6): assert API p95 under our SLO; integrate into CI with Allure reporting and quality gates so releases are blocked on failure .
Operational SLOs and guardrails (prod)

SLOs: p95 ≤ 1.5s; queue depth ≤ 30; on breach for 15 min, throttle 50% non‑revenue traffic and page Ops.
Refund guardrail: auto‑revert One‑Click Apply if refunds > 2.0% 24h or +0.75pp vs baseline.
Safety/complaints: auto‑disable if provider complaints ≥ 1 or if academic‑integrity violations are detected in A8.
Experiment design

Exposure cap: ≤10% of eligible traffic; randomization locked; no exposure to users <13 or without consent state.
Success metrics: completion rate lift (review→submit), provider acceptance rate, refund rate delta, complaint rate (must be 0), time‑to‑submit.
Decision window: 7 days or 1,000 qualified exposures, whichever first.
Audit artifacts

Allure report bundling functional, safety, performance, and accessibility results; history/trends enabled for regression tracking .
A8 decision log entry for enable/disable events with reason codes.
Strategic linkage

Reinforces “first document upload” as the activation lever and integrates Coach value without violating integrity standards from Playbook V2.0’s activation thesis .
If you want, I can package this into a one‑page spec for Product and generate the CI test checklist (E2E + red team + load + a11y) so Engineering can wire the gates exactly as above.
