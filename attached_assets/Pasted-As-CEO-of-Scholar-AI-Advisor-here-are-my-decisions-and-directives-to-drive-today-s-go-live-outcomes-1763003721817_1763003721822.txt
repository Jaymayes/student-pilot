As CEO of Scholar AI Advisor, here are my decisions and directives to drive today’s go-live outcomes while protecting our ARR plan and SLOs.

Executive decisions

provider_register launch gate

Decision: Choose Option B. Attempt performance optimization now and retest in the 18:00–19:00 UTC window. Do not relax the threshold.
Launch criteria for today’s retest: Read P95 ≤180ms and Mixed P95 ≤180ms. If Read P95 remains >180ms, HOLD launch and keep traffic dark-gated.
Post-pass guardrails: Cap concurrency to 100 providers; rollback if P95 >250ms for 10 minutes or error rate >1% for 5 minutes; 7-day remediation to achieve ≤120ms P95.
scholarship_api resilience

Decision: Approved to proceed with retest using the current in-memory TTL approach strictly for the test. Elevate Redis migration to P0 within 48 hours post-launch to reach production-grade durability, horizontal scale, and replay/idempotency integrity. This aligns with our governance requirement for reliable state in distributed services and auditability of autonomous behaviors .
Change freeze exception: Granted solely for the Redis migration and related monitoring hooks.
scholarship_agent

Decision: GO-LIVE READY in Observer Mode only. No sends until auto_com_center achieves P95 ≤120ms and Legal consent policy is cleared. This supports low-CAC growth while honoring our Responsible AI and compliance posture .
AUTO PAGE MAKER (SEO engine)

Decision: Scale as planned to prioritize organic growth and low CAC, per the 5-year playbook. This remains our primary acquisition lever to hit profitable ARR with minimal paid spend .
ADMIN_EMAILS secret

Decision: Set immediately to enable audit log access and operational oversight:
ceo@scholaraiadvisor.com
ciso@scholaraiadvisor.com
eng.oncall@scholaraiadvisor.com
ops.oncall@scholaraiadvisor.com
These emails must have admin RBAC and be included in security/audit alert routes to meet our governance and explainability mandates (human-on-the-loop approvals, override capability, decision traceability) .
Agent3 deliverables to execute now

Generate and post CEO-formatted status packages

Immediately produce the Section V–compliant packages for:
provider_register
auto_com_center
scholar_auth (final approved copy)
Each must include APP_BASE_URL at the top, Section IV attestation, evidence links (/health, /docs or /openapi, /evidence where available), and a concise compliance matrix.
provider_register retest readiness (complete by 17:30 UTC)

Set ADMIN_EMAILS secret and verify /admin/audit-logs access.
Read path optimization (in order of ROI and risk):
Confirm and add missing covering indexes on hot queries; verify query plans on the critical READ endpoint(s).
Reduce data payload with projection endpoints or lightweight DTOs for list views.
Eliminate N+1 via explicit joins or prefetch patterns.
Enable compression and ensure JSON serialization is non-blocking and streaming where applicable.
Apply safe, targeted cache for hottest 3 read queries (short TTL, cache-busting on writes). If Redis is already provisioned for scholarship_api, re-use the connection patterns; otherwise use process-local micro-cache only if risk-free.
Prep canary and automated rollback; warm caches if applicable.
Configure alerts: P95 >100ms (investigate), >120ms (esc), >250ms 10 min (rollback); error rate >0.5% (investigate), >1% 5 min (rollback).
Document results and post with evidence at 17:45 UTC.
scholarship_api hardening (begin immediately after retest window)

Implement Redis for replay protection and idempotency within 48 hours; add monitoring for cache sizes/expirations and process restart alerts.
This is required to support resilient scaling and compliance with our availability and recovery expectations and secrets/state management best practices on Replit .
CEO-formatted status reports APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY

Section IV confirmation: MFA/SSO, RBAC, TLS in transit, encryption at rest, audit logging, API docs, monitoring, DR and backups verified.
Performance: Meets portfolio SLOs (target 99.9% uptime, ~120ms P95) with headroom.
Evidence: Post links to health, discovery, JWKS, and API docs in the package.
Notes: Role-naming migration scheduled; Redis rate limiting scheduled next week. Compliance posture supports our SOC2 trajectory and Responsible AI standards .
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (pending 18:00–19:00 UTC retest)

Blockers: Read P95 currently ~203ms vs. ≤180ms gate; Mixed P95 158ms OK.
Plan: Optimize read path per directive; retest today. If pass, conditional launch with 100-provider cap and hard rollback triggers.
Estimated Go-Live Date: Today, contingent on retest pass; otherwise +48–72 hours to reach ≤180ms with indexes + projection + targeted cache.
ARR Ignition: Immediately upon launch; supports B2B fee capture via provider onboarding.
Third-Party Dependencies: scholar_auth OIDC (healthy), database performance and indexing; alerting/monitoring in place.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Private Beta only)

Blockers: Current P95 ~231ms; must reach ≤120ms for production sends. Observer integration with scholarship_agent OK.
Plan: 14-day performance remediation; prioritize queueing, connection reuse, payload size, and persistence strategy. Sends remain blocked until threshold met and Legal consent confirmed.
ARR Ignition: Contributes to B2C conversion lift once production sends enabled; supports low-CAC growth consistent with the playbook’s organic-first strategy .
Governance, compliance, and risk posture

Security and compliance: Enforce MFA/SSO, RBAC least privilege, encryption in transit/at rest, audit logging. Align with our SOC2 and privacy roadmap and Responsible AI commitments (bias mitigation, explainability, human-on-the-loop controls) .
Reliability and DR: Maintain 99.9% uptime targets, backups, and disaster recovery runbooks. Use Prometheus-style metrics and alerting patterns suitable for our Replit deployment model and microservice topology .
Operational discipline on Replit: Secrets management via Replit Secrets, production-ready data persistence, and staging-to-prod workflow separation as outlined in our readiness checklist .
What I need from Agent3 now

Confirm when ADMIN_EMAILS is set; post the config hash (redacting values).
Deliver the three CEO-formatted status packages for immediate executive-channel posting.
Complete provider_register optimizations by 17:30 UTC; post retest evidence during the 18:00–19:00 UTC window.
Upon retest pass, execute the conditional launch with guardrails and begin 7-day remediation to ≤120ms P95.
This plan keeps our ARR ignition window on track, prioritizes student and provider experience, and upholds the governance and reliability standards required for scale.
