Executive decision: Go. Ship now.

Rationale

Student value: Fix removes a critical blocker to browsing scholarships without login, reducing friction at the top of the funnel.
SLOs: Pre-prod P95 of 68ms (list) / 26ms (detail) is within our 120ms target.
Growth engine: Enables Auto Page Maker and SEO indexing to resume, lowering CAC via organic traffic.
Risk: Acceptable with feature-flagged anonymous browse limited to read-only endpoints.
Conditions for release acceptance (must be satisfied in production)

Functionality
Anonymous browse: list and detail accessible; save/apply gated behind auth.
Only active, public scholarships exposed; 404 for invalid IDs.
Reliability and performance (2-hour window)
API error rate <0.1% sustained; zero 500s on scholarship endpoints.
P95 latency ≤120ms on both endpoints.
Security and compliance
No PII in logs; read-only scope for anonymous endpoints.
Basic rate limiting enabled to deter scraping.
Robots.txt, sitemap, canonical tags, JSON-LD remain intact or improved.
Immediate actions and owners

Engineering (Agent3)
Click Publish in Replit.
Run the four post-deploy curl checks from the report and paste outputs into the release ticket.
Monitor logs for 2 hours; execute rollback per triggers already defined if thresholds are breached.
Auth Squad (48-hour SLA)
Resolve DEFECT-004 (OAuth discovery/callback).
Confirm auth gating is only on “save/apply” and does not regress browse.
Growth/SEO
Purge CDN cache; resubmit sitemap; trigger Auto Page Maker to regenerate index and detail pages; add deployment annotation in Analytics.
Ensure pages include canonical URLs and JSON-LD (Scholarship type) for rich results.
Analytics/Instrumentation
Verify the following events are firing with correct properties: scholarship_list_viewed, scholarship_detail_viewed, time_to_first_result, save_scholarship_clicked, apply_clicked.
Append UTM parameters to all outbound apply links.
KPIs to report

2-hour post-deploy (Engineering + Analytics)
API error rate, P95 latency, count of 500s, sessions to list and detail pages, time_to_first_result.
24-hour and 7-day (Growth + Analytics)
Organic sessions to scholarship list/detail.
List-to-detail CTR.
Detail-to-save CTR and save-to-signup conversion.
Apply click-through rate.
Any impact on ARPU from credit sales and free→paid conversion (directional).
SEO health: pages indexed, impressions, CTR (Search Console).
Experiment and follow-ups

Copy test (A/B within 72 hours): “Browse scholarships instantly — sign in when you’re ready to save or apply” vs. a shorter variant to maximize list-to-detail CTR.
Performance hardening (Engineering, this sprint):
Add ETag/Cache-Control headers on list/detail endpoints.
Tighten explicit projection tests in CI to prevent circular refs regression.
Security
Confirm rate limiting on public endpoints and redact sensitive fields in logs.
Quick FERPA/COPPA review of exposed payload to ensure no student data is ever included.
Rollback readiness

Prior snapshot recorded; if any rollback trigger fires (error rate >1% for 5 minutes, P95 >400ms for 10 minutes, or critical 500s), immediately revert and open a post-incident review within 24 hours.
What I need from you

Confirm “Publish” completed and paste the outputs of the four curl checks.
Post the 2-hour monitoring summary with the KPI table and a go/no-go for keeping the feature flag on.
Confirm sitemap resubmission and Auto Page Maker regeneration started.
Approved. Move fast, keep the student experience frictionless, and report back within the 2-hour window.
