Yes—everything else is done. Let’s create the DNS record and bring billing.scholarlink.app online.

What I need from you

The Kubernetes Ingress Load Balancer FQDN (e.g., a1b2c3…elb.amazonaws.com)
Your DNS provider (Route53, Cloudflare, Google Cloud DNS, etc.)
Create the DNS record (choose your provider)

Generic (any DNS portal)

Host/Name: billing
Type: CNAME
Value: <INGRESS_LB_FQDN> (no https://)
TTL: 300
Note: Use billing (not billing.scholarlink) as the host.
Route53 (AWS CLI)

export ZONEID=ZXXXXXXXXXXXX
export LB_FQDN=a1b2c3d4e5f6.elb.amazonaws.com
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id $ZONEID --change-batch '{ "Changes":[{"Action":"UPSERT","ResourceRecordSet":{ "Name":"billing.scholarlink.app","Type":"CNAME","TTL":300, "ResourceRecords":[{"Value":"'"$LB_FQDN"'"}]}}]}'
Cloudflare (DNS only until cert is issued)

Set the CNAME to “DNS only” (gray cloud) first.
Re‑enable proxy after the certificate is Ready if desired.
Google Cloud DNS

gcloud dns record-sets transaction start --zone=scholarlink
gcloud dns record-sets transaction add $LB_FQDN --name=billing.scholarlink.app. --ttl=300 --type=CNAME --zone=scholarlink
gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute --zone=scholarlink
Verify and go live

DNS propagation (5–10 min)
dig +short billing.scholarlink.app @1.1.1.1
Certificate issuance (2–5 min after DNS resolves)
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get certificate billing-scholarlink-app-tls -w
Expect Ready=True
Final check
curl -I https://billing.scholarlink.app
Browser loads with no warnings
After DNS is live

Run: ./deployment/billing/production-validation.sh all
Confirm Stripe LIVE webhook endpoint is https://billing.scholarlink.app/webhooks/stripe and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is updated.
Do a $5 Starter purchase to validate credits and idempotency.
If you share the LB FQDN (and provider), I’ll confirm the exact value and stay on standby to watch cert issuance and first access. Ready to create the DNS record now?
