Acknowledged. Excellent execution. Stay the course.

Decisions and directives

Ramp management

T+2h checkpoint (19:30 UTC): If guardrails remain green, proceed to 50% traffic. Post a health snapshot in the exec channel with:
p95 latency vs baseline and trend
5xx delta vs baseline
Auth metrics: blocked attempts, false-positive rate
Reconciliation delta (target $0)
PII redaction violations (target 0)
T+8h checkpoint (01:30 UTC): If guardrails remain green at 50%, proceed to 100%. Post stability report and confirm WAF hit metrics.
Controls to maintain during ramp (no change)

Auto-rollback triggers: p95 +15%, 5xx +0.5%, any PII redaction violation, or reconciliation delta > $0.
WAF protections on billing paths and SQLi signatures; tiered rate limiting.
CI/CD gates unchanged; do not weaken any rule.
Comms and compliance

Status page update at 17:40 UTC: Proceed as scheduled.
Partner assurance: Send after 50% stability confirmed.
Compliance archive: SBOM, signatures, build SHA, feature flags, SameSite/security changelog—already archived; keep immutable copies in GRC repo.
24-hour After-Action Review (AAR) deliverables (17:30 UTC tomorrow)

Security: 0 PII redaction violations; auth FP ≤0.5%; secret/artifact scans clean; WAF metrics reviewed.
Reliability: ≥99.9% uptime; p95 within ±10% baseline; endpoint contract health 100%.
Finance: Reconciliation deltas = $0; idempotency adherence report.
Process: Confirm all gates stayed mandatory; list any hotfixes applied during ramp.
Post-stabilization (after AAR and 100% traffic holds)

Resume Growth Sprint deployments behind flags in this order:
Pricing/onboarding experiments with entitlement checks (target +50% free→paid lift over baseline).
Provider Portal MVP (secure first 20 pilots/LOIs; process first GMV).
SEO instrumentation and CWV beacons on key templates; ramp Auto Page Maker pages.
Weekly KPI cadence: SSPAU (north-star), organic sessions, free→paid conversion, ARPU, index coverage, CWV pass rate, provider count/GMV/platform fees, CAC trend.
Risk watch items (monitor proactively)

Geo/client outliers in p95 and 5xx (e.g., mobile Safari).
Rate limit false positives near auth; ensure support override workflow works.
Any reconciliation drift in edge time windows (hour boundaries, retries).
CWV regressions after cache churn.
Keep me updated

Confirm the 19:30 UTC checkpoint snapshot in the exec channel.
Escalate immediately if any guardrail trips; do not wait for the next checkpoint.
Quality over speed remains the rule through the 8-hour ramp. Proceed.
