Below is the unified execution prompt for Agent3 across all eight Scholar AI Advisor applications. Important: Each Agent3 instance must only read and execute the section for its own app. Do not act on any other section. The objective is to get each app 100% ready and integrated today; if not possible, provide exact ETAs (UTC), ARR ignition date, and third-party prerequisites.

How to use this prompt

Identify your app by name and base URL below.
Only execute the instructions in your app’s section.
Produce the required reports with the exact naming and header format.
If you cannot achieve GO today, deliver precise ETAs and ARR ignition prerequisites as specified.
Shared launch objectives (apply to all apps)

Integration: Cross-app flows must function and be verified end-to-end for your app’s role.
Performance SLO: P95 latency ≈120ms; report actual P50/P95.
Availability: 99.9% target; provide current synthetic health check results.
Security: HTTPS enforced; CORS least-privilege; HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP; authentication enforced where applicable.
Compliance: Confirm data handling for FERPA/COPPA contexts where relevant.
Reporting: Every report must start with: APP NAME: <your_app_name> APP_BASE_URL: <your_app_base_url>
Output artifacts per app:
EXEC_STATUS_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
E2E_REPORT_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
GO_DECISION_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md (GO or NO-GO with reasons, ETAs, ARR plan)
If today’s GO is not achievable, include:
Ready-to-go-live ETA (UTC, precise hour)
ARR ignition date/time (UTC) and what revenue stream it unlocks (B2C/B2B)
Concrete third-party systems and credentials that must be in place
Blockers with owners and a mitigation plan
Dry-run safety: For any outbound communication (email/SMS/webhooks), default to DRY-RUN unless executing a single controlled live test to internal addresses.

SECTION: scholar_auth (Identity and OIDC/JWT Provider)
Scope: You are Agent3 for scholar_auth only.
APP NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Objectives today

Ensure JWT issuance is production-correct: iss, aud, exp=300s for M2M; RS256 signing; JWKS published.
Confirm M2M clients provisioned for all seven dependent apps; issue tokens; validate scopes/permissions.
Verify CORS, security headers, and 401 for unauthenticated requests on protected endpoints.
Publish integration docs for downstream services.
Readiness checklist

Endpoints:
/.well-known/jwks.json returns active RS256 keys with kid.
/oidc/token issues M2M tokens; verify claims: iss, aud="scholar-platform" (or configured value), scope, permissions[], roles[], client_id, iat/exp (300s).
/healthz, /readyz return 200 and reflect dependencies.
Security:
HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options present.
CORS limited to allowed frontends; no wildcard for credentials paths.
Clients to provision (confirm or create): scholarship_api, scholarship_agent, scholarship_sage, student_pilot, provider_register, auto_page_maker, auto_com_center.
Token validation contracts: Provide example cURL and JSON claims for each client.
Integration tests (read-only + token-based)

For each client: obtain token; call that app’s protected health or ping endpoint if available; expect 401 without token, 200/OK with token.
Confirm downstream apps validate iss, aud, and signature using JWKS.
Third-party prerequisites to list (only if used)

DNS/custom domain, CDN/WAF, secrets store.

Decision and reporting requirements (all apps)

GO today: Provide exact evidence for health, security, auth, performance, and successful cross-app tests within your scope. Include links/IDs and sample cURL where applicable.
NO-GO today: Provide
Exact ETA to ready-to-go-live (UTC)
ARR ignition date/time (UTC) and which revenue stream it unlocks (B2C/bundles via student_pilot; B2B via provider_register; platform fee via scholarship_api)
Concrete third-party systems that must be in place (only those actually used by your app), with environment variables and access requirements
Blockers with owners, workaround, and rollback/backout plan
Every report must start with: APP NAME: <your_app_name> APP_BASE_URL: <your_app_base_url>
Execution cadence and SLA

Act with urgency. First status due within 60 minutes: a brief EXEC_STATUS with preliminary GO/NO-GO confidence and identified blockers.
Final deliverables due by end-of-day today. If any item slips, provide timestamped updates and revised ETA immediately.
Remember

Use only the section that matches your app.
Stay data-first: include measurements, not opinions.
Student value is the driver: confirm the most critical flows your app enables.
Keep DRY-RUN on for any outbound comms unless performing the single, controlled, internal test.
