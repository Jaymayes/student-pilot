Decision: MAINTAIN STRATEGIC HOLD on A7 (Programmatic SEO Engine) launch until the Revenue Capture Loop is verified end-to-end. Proceed exactly as planned: validate A3 $\rightarrow$ Stripe $\rightarrow$ A5 $\rightarrow$ A8 with a signature_verified: true event and A8 Revenue Tile increment.Why (data/insight):Rationale affirmed: Scaling traffic without a proven "path-to-cash" risks negative unit economics (spending on inference without capturing value). We must validate capture of the first $1.00 before unleashing A7's Auto Page Maker1111.Observed status: A8 shows a prior $1.00 verified event; however, the gate requires a fresh end-to-end transaction initiated via A3, processed by Stripe, received and verified by A5, and reflected in A8.Non-blocking issue: A6 (Provider Register) health check is returning 500; I am designating this as non-blocking for the B2C revenue gate, but it must be resolved within 24 hours to protect the B2B funnel.Acceptance Criteria for Revenue Validation Gate (GREEN):All must be true within a 30-minute test window:A3 initiates checkout; Stripe charge is completed (test mode).A5 receives checkout.session.completed and logs signature_verified: true.A5 provisions "Scholar Credits" to the purchaser account automatically2.A8 Revenue Pulse Tile increments by $\ge \$1.00$ and total verified transaction count increases by 1.Latency: Webhook end-to-end P95 $\le$ 2s; error rate $\le$ 1% during the test window.Owners and Next ActionsOperator (Immediate): Complete the $1.00 Stripe Checkout at the provided cs_test_... URL found in the logs. Use 4242 test card. Deadline: Within 60 minutes.A5 Lead (Immediate): Monitor for signature_verified: true and confirm credits provisioning in student_pilot. Post exact timestamps and the user_id credited.Strategic Note: Although A3 generated the link, A5 is missing critical initiation endpoints (/api/credits/checkout). While this doesn't block the test, it blocks the product. A5 Lead must restore these endpoints immediately after verification.A8 Lead (Immediate): Confirm Revenue Tile increments by $1.00+ and transactionCount +1. Post the before/after snapshot.A6 Lead (Next 24h): Resolve health endpoint 500 error; add synthetic monitor and MSP v3-compliant telemetry on recovery.Go/No-Go on A7 (SEO Engine)GO: Upon confirmation of the above acceptance criteria from A5 and A8, I authorize immediate A7 deployment.Rollout plan: Ramp 0 $\rightarrow$ 500 pages/day for the first 10 days; hold at 5,000 total Year 1 target3.NO-GO: If any failure occurs, produce a 2-hour turnaround hotfix and repeat the $1.00 test until green.Pre-Approved SEO Keyword Clusters for A7To be drafted now and launched immediately upon passing the Revenue Gate.Strategic Goal: Capture high-intent, low-competition "long-tail" traffic to minimize CAC to $<\$10$4.1.

Upon confirmation, I will authorize A7 deployment immediately and task the team to publish the first 500 pages within the same business day.
