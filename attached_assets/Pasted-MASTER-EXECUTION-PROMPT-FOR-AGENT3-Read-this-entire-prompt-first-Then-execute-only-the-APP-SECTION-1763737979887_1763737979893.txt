MASTER EXECUTION PROMPT FOR AGENT3
Read this entire prompt first. Then execute only the APP SECTION that matches the app you are currently working in. Do not perform work from any other APP SECTION. Every deliverable you produce must begin with a two-field header line that names your app and base URL exactly:
App: <app_name> | APP_BASE_URL: <base_url>

Executive context (read-only; do not output this section):

You are an implementation agent executing one app’s workstream in a coordinated, same-day launch across eight apps. The CEO’s goal is to get all apps 100% production-ready and working together today. If you cannot get your app to revenue today, you must provide an honest ETA and list the third-party systems needed to go live.
Status line you must output at the end of your run (single line): App: <app_name> | Status: <GREEN|YELLOW|RED> | Revenue today: <YES|NO|CONDITIONAL YES> | ETA: <number + units or 0 hours> | Third-party prerequisites: <comma-separated list with ✅/⏳/❌>
SLOs you must validate or snapshot: Uptime ≥99.9% P95 latency ≤120ms Error rate <0.5% Auth/Success rate ≥99%
Security/Compliance: FERPA/COPPA/GDPR alignment No ghostwriting or academic dishonesty enablement Bias mitigation, rate limiting, audit logs on access to PII
Clarification of intent: “Ready to stop generating revenue” is interpreted as “ready to start generating revenue.” If not viable today, provide ETA-to-revenue and prerequisites.
Global rules (apply to all APP SECTIONs):

Only execute your app’s section. If you can’t determine your app, stop and output: “Unable to determine app. No actions taken.”
Put the header line “App: <app_name> | APP_BASE_URL: <base_url>” at the top of every report you create.
Create all required deliverables in your repository root as text/markdown/json files using the exact filenames provided.
Do not claim GREEN unless you validated with either successful smoke tests against the live base URL or you clearly state what is mocked and why.
If a human “Publish” action or credentials are required, stop, print the precise steps and credentials names, and provide a realistic ETA from the moment those are provided.
After completing deliverables, print the single-line status (exact format) and then list the deliverables you created with file sizes if available.
Post-publish 5-minute verification protocol (execute whenever the app is published or restarted to production):
Health endpoints return 200
Critical dependency checks pass (DB/JWKS/Webhooks/API keys)
SLO snapshot captured
First revenue-path transaction or event is traced end-to-end
Begin a 2-hour watch and note any anomalies
Rollback criteria you must declare in your reports:
P95 latency >120ms sustained >10 minutes
Error rate >2%
Auth failures spike or 5xx rate >0.5% sustained
Payment error rate >2% (if applicable) If any trigger, recommend rollback with clear steps.

If your repo/package name or environment mentions one of: scholar_auth, scholarship_api, scholarship_agent, scholarship_sage, student_pilot, provider_register, auto_page_maker, auto_com_center then execute that exact APP SECTION.
