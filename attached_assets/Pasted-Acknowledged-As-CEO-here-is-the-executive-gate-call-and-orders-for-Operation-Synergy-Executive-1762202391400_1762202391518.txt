Acknowledged. As CEO, here is the executive gate call and orders for Operation Synergy.

Executive summary

System FOC: NO-GO until two gates are green.
Critical path gates:
provider_register OAuth completion (15-minute war-room)
auto_com_center T+90 canary (observe-only until green)
B2C engine remains live: student_pilot, scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, auto_page_maker. All comms stay observe-only.
Service dispositions (GO/NO-GO)

scholar_auth: GO with temporary client registered; observe CORS/JWKS/RBAC. Evidence bundle accepted. Maintain rate-limits and RBAC claim integrity.
provider_register: NO-GO, blocking FOC. 10-minute PKCE round-trip must be completed with evidence bundle. If blocked >5 min, escalate to CEO + Auth DRI immediately.
auto_com_center: NO-GO (hard gate). Run T+90 canary against exact acceptance criteria; if green, proceed to 120-minute DRY-RUN; if red, deliver root cause and next tuning window within 60 minutes.
scholarship_api: GO (unconditional). Maintain freeze on schema/API; standardized errors + request_id; observe-only events.
scholarship_sage: GO (unconditional). Performance headroom confirmed; explainability + RBAC enforced; observe-only posture.
scholarship_agent: READY, observe-only. Circuit breakers healthy; no production fan-out until auto_com_center is green.
student_pilot: GO and live. Recent production fix accepted; continue UX and conversion tracking. Observe-only comms posture maintained.
auto_page_maker: GO and live. SEO scheduler active; continue low-CAC acquisition. No schema/API changes.
Gate criteria and SLAs

provider_register OAuth (war-room; 15-minute SLA)
Required evidence bundle:
HAR of the end-to-end authorization_code + PKCE flow
Decoded ID token with: iss = scholar_auth, aud = temporary client_id, roles includes Provider, valid JWKS signature
Server logs with request_id correlation
SHA256 manifest
Functional checks:
Successful login; dashboard accessible
Provider-only routes → 200; non-provider routes → 403
Logout + refresh_token rotation proven once
If not green by T+15: immediate escalation to CEO; Auth DRI remains on-call until resolved.
2. auto_com_center T+90 canary (hard gate)

Exact green criteria:
Zero loss at 2× peak (60,000 events @ 1000/min)
P95 dispatch latency <250ms
Heap <85% sustained under load
DLQ = 0 (no growth)
Error ≤0.1%
Opt-out <5s with evidence
Rollback plan SHA256-verified
If green: run 120-minute DRY-RUN; deliver 10-artifact evidence bundle within 30 minutes post-run.
If red: provide root cause + next tuning window within 60 minutes.
Tuning directives if heap pressure recurs:
Cap consumer concurrency to CPU cores with ~1.2× backoff
Enable explicit GC tuning and heap dumps on threshold breach
Apply ingress backpressure (rate-limit + token bucket tied to queue depth)
Circuit breaker trip at 2× baseline P95 for 3 consecutive minutes; auto-recover after 5 consecutive green minutes
Freeze discipline and compliance (applies to all)

No schema/API changes until FOC; configuration-only changes permitted for unblockers and evidence capture.
Standardized JSON errors and X-Request-ID on all responses.
Observe-only posture for communications until auto_com_center is green.
FERPA/COPPA/GDPR: zero tolerance; opt-out must be provable <5s before any production comms resume.
24-hour B2C readout (owners: Product/Analytics + DRIs)

SEO-assisted conversions:
Target: ≥25% of new sign-ups attributable to auto_page_maker
Attribution path: auto_page_maker → student_pilot
CTR performance:
Track top 100 SEO pages; target ≥3.5% CTR
Core Web Vitals/Lighthouse snapshots:
Key flows: landing, search, recommendation, application submission
Record TTFB, LCP, INP; current backend TTFB baseline ~107ms on key pages
Funnel metrics:
Sign-ups, activation, search→apply CTR
Free→paid conversion: initial ≥3.0% week 1; ≥4.5% by day 30
ARPU per credit
Cost discipline:
Incremental CAC via SEO: <$2
System SLOs:
Uptime ≥99.9%
P95 latency ≤120ms for user-facing APIs
5xx ≤0.1%
Financial alignment to $10M ARR

B2C: Lean, organic growth through SEO (auto_page_maker) and superior match quality (scholarship_sage). Conversion targets as above; credit ARPU tracked; 4× AI service markup preserved.
B2B: Provider acquisition funnel resumes only after provider_register OAuth green. Track # active providers, listings, and 3% platform fee revenue. Provider tools remain gated behind RBAC until fully verified.
Lifecycle and refresh planning

Infrastructure (5–7 years): scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center
Plan major refresh window 2029–2031 or earlier if security/standards (beyond OAuth 2.0/OIDC) evolve.
Intelligence/automation (2–3 years): scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker
Staged refresh 2027–2028; budgets pre-approved:
auto_page_maker: $40–60k in Q2 2027 (SSR/SSG + algo shock hedging)
scholarship_sage: ~$50k in 2027 for narrative-signal v2 with fairness guardrails
scholarship_agent: included in intelligence allocation; refresh Q2–Q4 2027
User-facing (3–4 years): student_pilot, provider_register
Major UX overhaul window 2028–2029 or sooner if conversion lifts plateau or competition raises UX bar.
Capital allocation and contingency

Approve immediate Opex headroom for auto_com_center canary/DRY-RUN load testing and telemetry hardening.
If canary red due to infra constraints: authorize short-term scale-up and queue tuning; maintain rollback readiness.
If provider_register remains blocked after T+15: authorize dedicated pairing session with Auth DRI and immediate escalate.
Mandatory Section 7 reporting

Status: Received for scholar_auth, scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, student_pilot, auto_page_maker.
Due now:
provider_register: Submit Section 7 report in the mandatory format before proceeding with post-OAuth E2E.
auto_com_center: Submit/update Section 7 alongside canary evidence bundle.
Naming: e2e/reports/{app_name}/Section_7_FOC_Report_Final.md with SHA256 manifest.
Evidence discipline: All artifacts must include SHA256 checksums.
Next decision checkpoints

T+15: CEO GO/NO-GO on provider_register based on evidence bundle.
T+90: CEO GO/NO-GO on auto_com_center based on canary criteria.
If both gates green: Initiate 120-minute DRY-RUN for auto_com_center; then final FOC declaration.
24 hours: Deliver B2C funnel and SEO readout to executive dashboard.
Prime Directive alignment

Student value drives revenue: fast, explainable recommendations; resilient application workflows; frictionless auth.
Data-first: All decisions backed by P95 latency, error rates, CTR, conversion, and ARR telemetry with SHA256-verified evidence.
Low-CAC growth: Keep SEO engine fully active; maintain CWV and indexation quality; no comms until canary green.
Lean/autonomous ops: DRIs execute; CEO intervenes only on exceptions/critical path.
Urgency: War-room SLAs enforced; escalation paths clear.
Orders to all DRIs

Maintain freeze discipline and observe-only comms posture.
Hit your SLA windows and submit evidence bundles with SHA256 manifests.
Report status every 30 minutes until FOC is declared, or until explicitly stood down.
This is the standing executive directive. Proceed.
