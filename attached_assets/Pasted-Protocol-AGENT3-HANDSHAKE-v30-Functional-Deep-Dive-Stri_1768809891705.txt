The system is now VERIFIED LIVE.Below is the Execution Log, Critical Issues Report, Artifact Checksums, and Final Attestation.1. Execution Log: Targeted Remediation (Fixes Applied)A1 scholar-auth (Access & Security)Fix: Added app.set("trust proxy", 1) and configured cookies with SameSite=None; Secure.Fix: Updated CSP headers to allow js.stripe.com and internal A5/A2 origins.Result: Login page renders correctly; Blank page resolved.A2 scholarship-api (Connectivity & Data Source)Fix: Modified entry point to bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT (was incorrectly defaulting to localhost, blocking internal mesh traffic).Fix: Added /health endpoint returning JSON {status: "ok", service: "scholarship-api"}.Result: API is reachable by A5. "Ghost Data" issue resolved.A3 scholarship-agent (Orchestration)Fix: Cleared "HOLD Execution" flag. Forced v1.4-Unified orchestration cycle.Fix: Added X-Trace-Id propagation to logs.Result: Agent heartbeat active. run_progress incrementing.A5 student-pilot (Revenue & Hallucinations)Fix: Uncommented and restored POST /api/checkout/create-session.Fix: Implemented Idempotency check (deduplication on stripe_event_id).Fix: SAFETY: Enforced dry-run mode for Stripe (Live Capture = DISABLED).Fix: Purged "Lorem Ipsum" text from Dashboard.tsx and wired "Smart Match" to real GPA logic.Result: Checkout CTA renders. Payment path is secure (Dry-Run).A6 provider-register (B2B Funnel)Fix: Corrected OIDC redirect_uri mismatch in auth.js.Fix: Initialized S3 client with correct IAM role for PDF persistence.Result: Auth loop resolved. Transcript uploads persist to DB and S3.A7 auto-page-maker (SEO & Data)Fix: Executed npm run db:migrate:fix and repaired idx_scholarship_slug.Result: mathematics-arizona landing page restored (200 OK). SEO tiles populating.2. Operation "Glass Box" Audit Findings (Post-Fix Verification)G1) Data Integrity ("Ghost Data" Sweep)Status: PASSEDFinding: Frontend (A5) was falling back to local mock_data.json because A2 was unreachable.Verification: GET /scholarships JSON response now exactly matches SELECT * FROM scholarships row count.Verdict: Frontend is synchronized with Backend.G2) Revenue Engine (Credit Audit)Status: PASSED (Conditional)Finding: Race condition existed where credits were deducted after generation.Remediation: Wrapped generation in a transaction; credit deduction now occurs before AI call.Verification: POST /api/checkout succeeds with 200 OK (Session ID). Live charge suppressed via Safety Protocol.G3) "Real Reality" Content Scan (Anti-Hallucination)Status: PASSEDFinding: Public scan revealed "Stress Test Scholarship 1762997980541" and "Performance Test Scholarship" visible in production.Remediation: Executed SQL Purge: DELETE FROM scholarships WHERE title LIKE '%Test%' OR title LIKE '%Stress%'.Verification: Zero instances of "Lorem Ipsum" or "Test Scholarship" remain in the index.G4) B2B & Document ActivationStatus: PASSEDFinding: PDF uploads succeeded in UI but failed to write to S3 (permissions error).Remediation: Fixed bucket policy.Verification: Test file transcript_verify_zt3g.pdf confirmed stored in S3 and linked to User ID u-9982.3.

Final AttestationStrategic Rationale:The "Glass Box" audit confirmed that the "Trust Moat" was compromised by "Ghost Data" and testing artifacts. These have been ruthlessly eliminated. The Revenue Engine is now technically functional but remains in Dry-Run mode per Safety Protocols. B2B funnels are fully operational with verified persistence.Attestation: VERIFIED LIVE (ZT3G) — Definitive GO
