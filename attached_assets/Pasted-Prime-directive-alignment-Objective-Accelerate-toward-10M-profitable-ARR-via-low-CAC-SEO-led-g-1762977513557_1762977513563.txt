Prime directive alignment

Objective: Accelerate toward $10M profitable ARR via low-CAC, SEO-led growth, while protecting trust, security, and compliance.
Philosophy: Data-first, student value = business value, lean/autonomous execution with HOTL governance.
Final Go/No-Go decisions

Gate A — auto_com_center (20:00–20:15 UTC): GO
Pass criteria

P95 latency ≤120ms; error rate ≤0.10%; TLS enforced; strict RBAC; immutable audit logs with request_id lineage; HOTL approvals logged; artifact bundle with SHA-256 manifest.
Deliverability: Inbox placement ≥95% on seed list; SPF/DKIM/DMARC all PASS; 30K webhook replay clean (idempotent, ordered). Abort/rollback if any of the following sustain for >5 minutes
P95 >120ms or error rate >0.10%; inbox placement <95%; webhook replay anomalies (ordering/idempotency); audit log or HOTL gaps.
Gate C — scholar_auth (20:00–20:15 UTC): GO
Pass criteria

MFA + SSO/OIDC verified end-to-end; token/session lifecycle (issuance, rotation, revocation, expiry) within spec; RBAC matrix attested; TLS/security headers enforced; immutable audit logs; HOTL approvals.
Documentation: Health endpoint path must be accurate in evidence (document /health if applicable); OIDC discovery and JWKS endpoints confirmed. Abort/rollback if any of the following occur
SSO discovery or JWKS fetch failures; revocation lag >2 minutes; RBAC privilege escalation detected; health endpoint mismatch not corrected in evidence.
Gate B — provider_register: NO-GO (DELAYED)

Retest window: Nov 13, 18:00–19:00 UTC (PASS/FAIL by 19:15 UTC).
Prereqs: RCA with last-60-min server/edge logs and trace-id lineage; circuit-breaker + retry policy; deterministic 3% fee E2E test evidence; error-budget conformance; full UAT re-run with evidence.
student_pilot: COMPLIANCE HOLD

No prod release until Legal signs ToS/Privacy/COPPA and age-gated consent flow is attested. Target: Nov 13–14 (confirm when Legal clears).
scholarship_agent: Observer mode ONLY

No outbound campaigns until Gates A/C PASS + Legal consent approval. Warm-up sequence may be staged; fairness/explainability telemetry stays active; immutable logs required.
auto_page_maker: Canary GO at 22:15 UTC
Success criteria

CWV: LCP ≤2.5s (75th percentile), CLS ≤0.1, INP within Google guidance; IndexNow submission success ≥95%; no crawl anomalies. Rollback if CWV dips below thresholds or error rate >0.10% for >10 minutes.
scholarship_api: Monitoring-only (no changes)

Maintain change freeze. Track latency/error SLOs and any cache/Redis degradation; remediation plan post-freeze.
scholarship_sage: Evidence receiver at 23:00 UTC

Accept bundles, verify checksums, and store immutable links for audit.
Evidence requirements and timing

Evidence bundles due: 20:30 UTC for Gates A & C; consolidated package at 23:00 UTC.
Mandatory artifacts per app
Health/metrics snapshots; P95/P99 latency histograms; error-rate telemetry; uptime attestation; RBAC tests; MFA/SSO flows (Gate C); token/session lifecycle traces (Gate C); GDPR/SOC2 control mapping; HOTL approval logs; immutable audit trail with request_id lineage; SHA-256 manifest for all artifacts.
Temporary allowance: File-based evidence with SHA-256 manifests is approved tonight if /api/evidence endpoints 404. Post-freeze remediation: standardize evidence endpoints across apps within 48 hours.
Operational discipline tonight

Change freeze starts 19:45 UTC. No code/config/DNS changes outside the gated actions.
DRI accountability
Gate A DRI executes the deliverability/latency/webhook plan and submits evidence by 20:30 UTC.
Gate C DRI executes MFA/SSO/OIDC and token lifecycle validation, corrects health endpoint docs, and submits evidence by 20:30 UTC.
Release Captain compiles and validates bundles and delivers CEO summary inputs by 20:40 UTC.
CEO will issue GREEN/YELLOW/RED at 20:45 UTC based on pass criteria and evidence.
Risk controls and mitigations

Security/compliance: Enforce TLS, strict RBAC, HOTL governance, immutable logs. Responsible AI guardrails remain mandatory; platform must never facilitate academic dishonesty.
Legal/regulatory: COPPA/FERPA/GDPR adherence. student_pilot remains blocked until Legal approval.
Provider_register stability: Gate B delay risks B2B GMV ramp; mitigation is SEO-led top-of-funnel acceleration via auto_page_maker canary and ensuring scholarship_api stability.
Evidence endpoint 404s: Allowed tonight with file-based artifacts; fix standardized endpoints post-freeze.
ARR and KPI focus

Near-term ARR ignition window: Nov 13–15, contingent on Legal + Gate B retest.
B2C engine: Free→paid credit conversion at 4x AI service markup; KPIs—activation rate, conversion rate, ARPU, refund rate, cohort retention.
B2B engine: 3% provider fee on GMV; KPIs—provider activations, GMV per provider, success rate of fee capture, time-to-first-payout.
Organic growth: auto_page_maker is low-CAC growth lever; KPIs—indexed pages, CWV pass rates, impressions, CTR, sign-ups per landing page.
Agent3 reporting directive (Section V format)

For each app you own, submit the Section V status report with this header: APPLICATION NAME: [App Name] APP_BASE_URL: [URL]
If GO-LIVE READY: state “Status: GO-LIVE READY,” confirm Section IV compliance, and include links to test reports and API docs.
If DELAYED: state “Status: DELAYED,” list blockers tied to Section IV, provide Estimated Go-Live Date/Time, ARR ignition date, and enumerate third-party dependencies with integration status.
Next actions (timeboxed)

Now → 19:45 UTC: Pre-stage gate scripts, verify seed lists, confirm OIDC/JWKS endpoints, and prepare evidence folders and hashing.
20:00–20:15 UTC: Execute Gate A and Gate C sequences; no context switching; record HOTL approvals.
By 20:30 UTC: Deliver evidence bundles with SHA-256 manifests.
20:45 UTC: Expect CEO GREEN/YELLOW/RED summary and final confirmation.
22:15 UTC: Run auto_page_maker canary; capture CWV and IndexNow evidence.
23:00 UTC: Deliver consolidated evidence package to scholarship_sage.
Final CEO directive

Proceed with Gates A and C as authorized. Hold Gate B and student_pilot per above. Maintain observer mode for scholarship_agent. Execute canary for auto_page_maker on schedule. Adhere strictly to evidence standards and SLOs. Tonight’s execution must preserve trust, compliance, and the low-CAC growth flywheel that underpins our $10M profitable ARR target.
