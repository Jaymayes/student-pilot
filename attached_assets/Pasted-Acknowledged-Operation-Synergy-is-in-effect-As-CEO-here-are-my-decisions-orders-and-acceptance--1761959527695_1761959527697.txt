Acknowledged. Operation Synergy is in effect. As CEO, here are my decisions, orders, and acceptance criteria to reach Full Operational Capability and proceed to a controlled soft launch.

Executive decisions (effective immediately)

No-GO for platform-wide launch until Gates 1 and 2 are GREEN
Conditional GO for non-blocking services:
auto_com_center: Approved in dry-run with manual fallback for first 10–20 customers
scholarship_sage: Approved GREEN; A/B testing OFF for first 48 hours
provider_register: Approved GREEN; hold B2B onboarding emails until Gates 1 & 2 are GREEN
Feature freeze: 48-hour change freeze on non-critical features across all apps; Security and P0 stability fixes only
Acquisition freeze: No paid acquisition until post–soft launch stability is confirmed; prioritize SEO via auto_page_maker once Gate 2 is GREEN
Blocking gates, DRIs, deadlines, acceptance criteria

Gate 1 — scholar_auth JWKS (DRI: Auth Lead) [Deadline: T+30 minutes]

Required to pass:
JWKS endpoint publicly reachable over TLS (/.well-known/jwks.json)
RS256 keys served with kid present; token verification succeeds downstream
CORS restricted to student_pilot and provider_register; rate limiting on all endpoints
Security headers: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
P95 ≤ 120 ms on /login, /register, /token/refresh
Authorized paths:
Option A: Force production rebuild (preferred)
Option B: Fresh deployment + URL propagation to all 7 services if cache persists > 15 minutes
Escalation: If not GREEN by T+30, escalate to CTO, execute Option B immediately, and post evidence
Gate 2 — scholarship_api /canary v2.7 (DRI: API Lead) [Start after Gate 1 GREEN; Deadline: T+30 from Gate 1 GREEN]

Required to pass:
/canary returns v2.7 with 8 fields, dependencies_ok: true, p95_ms captured
RBAC enforced; protected routes return 401/403 (never 200/500 unauthenticated)
Validating JWTs against scholar_auth; SystemService role accepted for M2M
Security headers: 6/6 present on all routes
Data validation/sanitization enabled on create/update endpoints
Performance: P95 ≤ 120 ms; 5xx < 0.5% during canary checks
Escalation: If not GREEN by deadline, rollback to last known good build and re-attempt within 30 minutes
Gate 3 — student_pilot E2E smoke (DRI: Frontend Lead) [Begin after Gates 1 & 2 GREEN; Deadline: T+60 minutes]

Required to pass:
Auth flow (login/register/refresh/logout) succeeds; auth success rate ≥ 98%
Profile create/update; search results load ≤ 2.5s; recommendations integrate from scholarship_sage
Save/apply/status flow; no PII leaks in logs; Lighthouse accessibility ≥ 90
P95 API latency ≤ 120 ms (auth, search, recommendations, submit)
Deliverables: HAR file, screenshots, metrics summary
Soft launch plan (upon all gates GREEN)

Cohort: First 10–20 providers and an early user cohort; transactional comms only
Duration: 48 hours stabilization window; no promotions
auto_com_center: Remain in dry-run for first 24–48 hours; manual fallback engaged
Rollout levers:
T+0: Enable provider onboarding funnel (provider_register)
T+0 to T+24: Monitor closed-loop flows (listing → discovery → apply → provider review)
T+24 to T+48: If error budget healthy and metrics on target, exit dry-run in auto_com_center
Exit criteria from soft launch:
Platform error rate (5xx) < 0.5% sustained 6 hours
Auth success ≥ 98%; token refresh failure < 1%
P95 ≤ 120 ms across auth, API, recommendations, submit
DLQ ≤ 1%; bounce/complaint webhooks operational; unsubscribe honored
Compliance and risk controls (non-negotiable)

FERPA/COPPA: No under-13 accounts; parental consent workflows enforced where applicable
Responsible AI: scholarship_sage recommendations must provide rationale metadata; no essay auto-writing; assistive guidance only
Security: Password hashing (argon2/bcrypt), rate limiting, input sanitization, PII redaction in logs, least-privilege tokens (SystemService for M2M)
Data governance: Retention policies applied; user export/delete endpoints operational; HTTPS/TLS everywhere
KPI scorecard for soft launch (daily)

B2C funnel:
Activation (profile completed within 24h): ≥ 60%
Time-to-first-value (first 3 matches): ≤ 5 minutes median
Save-to-apply rate: ≥ 30%; free→paid conversion baseline target: 3–5% (credits ARPU tracked)
B2B funnel:
Providers live: 10–20; listings created per provider: ≥ 2
Provider response SLA: < 48h on first 10 applications
3% fee acceptance confirmed in provider_register; disclosure visible
Platform/SLOs:
P95 latency ≤ 120 ms; 99.9% uptime; DLQ ≤ 1%; unsubscribe honor rate 100%
Section 7 reporting (mandatory)

Each DRI must submit the Section 7 report for their app within T+2 hours of gate completion:
Application identification
Task completion status (4.X)
Integration verification
Lifecycle and revenue cessation analysis (date, rationale, contingencies)
Operational readiness declaration (READY/NOT READY)
Lifecycle benchmarks:
Infrastructure (auth, api, com center): 5–7 years
User-facing (student_pilot, provider_register): 3–4 years
Intelligence/automation (sage, agent, page maker): 2–3 years
War-room cadence and evidence

Cadence:
Until all gates GREEN: 15-minute updates in the war-room channel with evidence
During soft launch: Hourly updates first 6 hours, then every 4 hours
Evidence bundle per gate:
Exact curl outputs for /canary, JWKS, protected route checks
Response headers dump displaying 6/6 security headers
P95 samples (min N=30) and error-rate snapshot
Any rollback or mitigation actions taken
Capital allocation and resourcing

Immediate allocation:
Auth Lead: 1 senior engineer + 1 SRE until Gate 1 GREEN
API Lead: 1 senior engineer + 1 QA until Gate 2 GREEN
Frontend Lead: 1 QA + 1 UX for student_pilot smoke and accessibility
Spend posture:
No paid ads for 14 days; invest effort in auto_page_maker content and indexation monitoring
Approve budget for transactional email provider (Postmark or equivalent) upon exit from dry-run
Next required actions (owners)

Auth Lead: Execute production deploy now per runbook; post JWKS and latency evidence within 30 minutes
API Lead: Begin v2.7 canary deploy immediately after Gate 1 GREEN; post evidence within 30 minutes of start
Frontend Lead: Prepare to run E2E smoke the moment Gate 2 flips GREEN; submit HAR, metrics, screenshots within 60 minutes
Ops: Open incident bridge; start 15-minute update cadence; track SLO/error-budget in real time
Agent3 leads (all apps): Submit Section 7 reports by T+2 hours post-gates
CEO go/no-go statement

Current: No-GO for general release; Conditional GO for non-blocking services in controlled mode
Path to GO: Gates 1 and 2 GREEN → Gate 3 E2E pass → 48-hour soft launch with transactional comms only → Exit dry-run on proof of stability
I will authorize soft launch the moment Gate 3 passes and all acceptance criteria are met. Own your gate, post your evidence, and move with urgency. Our mission is profitable ARR and market leadership—stability and trust come first.
