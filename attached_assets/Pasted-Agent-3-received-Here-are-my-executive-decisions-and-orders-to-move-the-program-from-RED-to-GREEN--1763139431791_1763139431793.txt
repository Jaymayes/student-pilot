Agent 3, received. Here are my executive decisions and orders to move the program from RED to GREEN and protect ARR ignition.

CEO decisions (effective immediately)

Critical path choice: Access or mirror
Grant access path: Ops must grant you and the named DRIs edit/deploy access to scholar_auth, scholarship_api, and auto_com_center within 30 minutes of this order. If access is granted, execute Sequential Workspace Execution immediately.
Direct control path (fallback): If access is not granted by T+30 minutes, you are authorized to mirror the three workspaces under the CEO org, execute Gate 0 in the mirrored environments, and cut over DNS when evidence meets go-live bars. The “isolation” constraint on Replit microservices is known and expected in our operating model; we solve via rigorous orchestration and crisp contracts, not wishful coupling .
Scope freeze: No net-new features across the suite until Gate 0/1 bars pass. All work is security, performance, integration, or test only.
Budget approvals: Approved up to $1,500 for k6 Cloud credits and up to $2,500 for ESP/SMS onboarding and domain verification. Reserve VM and Redis spend approved as required to meet performance SLOs. Follow the deployment readiness playbook for Replit Reserved VM/Autoscale and Secrets hygiene .
Non‑negotiable Gate 0 go-live bars

scholar_auth
RS256 JWTs via JWKS; 300s TTL; RBAC claims for student, provider, admin; M2M client_credentials for all internal services; MFA enforced for admin/provider_admin; strict CORS allowlist; no hardcoded secrets. Evidence: sample tokens, JWKS, role matrix, MFA proof, CORS test log. Replit Secrets for all credentials; no inline keys .
scholarship_api
JWT signature + claims validation middleware; role/route authorization; strict CORS; connection pooling; Redis for caching/rate-limit; Reserved VM or Autoscale enabled; /readyz with DB/Redis/JWKS checks; OpenAPI served. Performance test: 250–300 RPS for 10 minutes, P95 ≤120ms, error rate ≤0.5% under k6. Evidence: config diffs, run ID, charts, /readyz snapshot. If synchronous hotspots persist, apply retry/backoff and circuit-breakers on client paths to prevent cascading failures .
auto_com_center
SendGrid (email) and Twilio (SMS) integrated; domain verification (SPF, DKIM, DMARC); service-to-service auth; webhook/trigger endpoint online. Canary: 250 RPS for 30 minutes with ≤0.5% errors. Evidence: provider dashboards, verification screenshots, run ID.
Gate 1–2 bars (unblock the funnels with minimum viable integrations)

student_pilot and provider_register
Eliminate hardcoded URLs; env-driven configs only. Auth flow live against scholar_auth; attach JWT to all API calls; standardized error handling; GA4 events wired for “First Document Upload” as the activation North Star event. This metric drives our product and growth engine per the Playbook V2.0; instrument it now for attribution and funnel analysis .
scholarship_agent
M2M auth to scholarship_api; structured logging; alerting for background failures; notification triggers to auto_com_center.
Risk, compliance, and Responsible AI requirements

No “black box” services for critical decisions. Maintain explainability and audit trails for auth, matching, and automated actions, with human-on-the-loop approval gates for high-risk changes .
Bias and fairness: Document data sources and add fairness checks to recommendation logic before broad release; monitor for disparate impact as we scale .
Secrets and S2S security: All secrets in Replit Secrets; enforce service identity and authorization consistently across apps .
Execution plan and ownership

If access granted in 30 minutes (preferred path)
Hour 0–2: scholar_auth hardening (MFA, JWKS, RBAC, CORS, M2M). Security Lead with Agent 3 support.
Hour 2–4: scholarship_api security/perf (JWT middleware, pooling, Redis, /readyz, Autoscale/Reserved VM). Platform Lead with Agent 3.
Hour 4–6: auto_com_center integrations (SendGrid/Twilio, triggers, S2S auth) and 30-minute canary. Platform Lead.
Hour 6–8: k6 retest on scholarship_api; finalize evidence packages for Gate 0 decision.
If access is not granted by T+30 minutes (fallback path)
Mirror scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center under CEO org; replay the same sequence; cut over DNS when Gate 0 evidence passes; freeze legacy apps post-cutover. Follow the Replit deployment readiness checklist for custom domains and Reserved VM rollouts .
Testing and acceptance

Apply the testing hierarchy: unit, integration, system/E2E. No go-live until E2E Student and Provider journeys pass with signed evidence and defects triaged. Use the tools and cadence outlined in the testing guide to prevent regressions and ensure cross-service reliability at speed .
Go/no‑go and dates

Gate 0 decision window: Nov 15, 10:30 AM MST. Status must be GREEN with evidence on scholar_auth, scholarship_api, and auto_com_center.
ARR ignition plan (kept, but gated): If Gate 0 passes on Nov 15, proceed to Gate 2 frontends and controlled B2C soft-launch; provider onboarding opens to a limited cohort after Gate 1 passes. This sequencing aligns with our low-CAC SEO-led growth thesis and five-year ARR track in the Playbook V2.0 .
KPIs tied to this directive

Platform readiness: Gate 0 pass (Y/N), P95 latency ≤120ms at 250–300 RPS, error rate ≤0.5% on core APIs.
B2C funnel instrumentation: % of new sign-ups reaching “First Document Upload,” conversion to paid credits (ARPU baseline), support for SEO landing flow from Auto Page Maker .
B2B ramp signals: # providers with verified accounts and at least one listed scholarship; average time-to-first-listing.
Reporting cadence

During Gate 0 execution: Hourly updates with RED/AMBER/GREEN by service and a single rolling risk log. Include k6 run IDs, /readyz snapshots, and config diffs each hour.
Post Gate 0: Twice-daily until Gate 2 passes; daily thereafter.
Final notes to unblock you

You are authorized to:
Proceed on either path above based on the T+30 minute outcome.
Freeze any work that competes with Gate 0/1 security and performance.
Reject any change that introduces new secrets in code or expands CORS beyond the allowlist.
If the platform cannot meet performance bars on Replit after remediation, return with a quantified cost/performance comparison and a migration proposal; our Replit strategy anticipates either Autoscale/Reserved VM tuning or, if necessary, a targeted migration of hot paths to more robust infrastructure as load grows .
