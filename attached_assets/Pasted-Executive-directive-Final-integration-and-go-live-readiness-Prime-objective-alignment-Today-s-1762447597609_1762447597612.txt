Executive directive: Final integration and go‑live readiness

Prime objective alignment

Today’s focus is to complete staging validation across all 8 apps, preserve the Nov 9 (1% ramp) and Nov 12 ARR ignition, and protect platform SLOs (P95 ≤120ms, error <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9%) while maintaining CAC discipline via SEO-first.
Chain-wide timeline and gates (UTC)

16:00: Auth + infra secrets delivery (Postmark, Sentry, AWS SQS/DLQ). Gate: must be received by 16:15 or auto-escalate.
17:00: DNS posture green (SPF/DKIM/DMARC). Gate: if not green, hold outbound email; continue dry-run validations.
17:05–20:30: Run staging validation suites (per-app directives below).
21:00: auto_com_center publishes STAGING_VALIDATION.md.
21:15: CEO-led chain roll‑up: GO/NO‑GO recommendation for Nov 9 (1% ramp).
Immediate orders by application
Important: Every report must begin with the two-line header:
Application: <App Name>
APP_BASE_URL: <URL>

scholar_auth
Action: Deliver CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md and complete M2M secret rotation by 16:00 (hard gate for student_pilot, provider_register, scholarship_sage).
Evidence by 17:00:
OIDC discovery doc reachable
Token issuance + revocation tested against protected routes in student_pilot, provider_register, scholarship_agent
Session/refresh handling proof (short TTL + refresh path)
If not 100% today: commit ETA for go‑live, ARR ignition impact, and list third parties (none expected beyond SSO/OIDC) with status and blockers.
2. scholarship_api

Action: At 17:05, execute ORDER_4 trigger (scholarship_created/updated and match events) to fan-out to auto_page_maker and auto_com_center.
Evidence by 19:00:
ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md with OpenAPI doc link, auth token validation proof, ACID/consistency notes, and load test summary (target P95 ≤120ms).
Event emission logs with request_id propagation.
If not 100%: provide ETA, ARR ignition impact, and third-party list/status.
3. scholarship_agent

Action: Observe-only. Verify fairness telemetry and “why this match?” metadata on events sent to auto_com_center after ORDER_4.
Evidence by 20:30:
Fairness/explainability sample bundle with request_id traces to auto_com_center.
Confirmation that auto‑apply is disabled; notification-only.
If not 100%: provide ETA, ARR impact, third-party list/status.
4. scholarship_sage

Dependency: Begins 48-hour baseline immediately upon M2M secret rotation from scholar_auth.
Action: Start baseline today if secrets received by 16:00; otherwise log delay and revised start time.
Evidence:
In roll-up: start timestamp, current SLOs (latency, errors), request_id readiness.
baseline_metrics_evidence.md due +48h from baseline start.
If not 100%: provide ETA, ARR impact, third-party list/status.
5. student_pilot

Action: Upon auth clearance, execute 95-step E2E test (registration, profile submit, viewing matches, Sage interaction, communications hooks).
Evidence within 10 minutes of auth clearance:
E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md including cross-browser checks, Stripe test flow, request_id traces to auto_com_center, P95 ≤120ms, error <0.1%.
If not 100%: provide ETA, ARR impact, third-party list/status.
6. provider_register

Action: Upon receiving CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md from scholar_auth, validate provider onboarding, scholarship CRUD, dashboard access.
Evidence within 10 minutes of auth clearance:
ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md with server/client validation proof, API auth checks, and request_id traces to scholarship_api and auto_com_center.
If not 100%: provide ETA, ARR impact, third-party list/status.
7. auto_page_maker

Action: On scholarship_api ORDER_4, generate at least 2 pages within 60 seconds; propagate request_id.
Evidence by 20:30:
SITEMAP_DIFF.md, IndexNow receipts, CWV p75 green snapshot, P95 ≤120ms proof, rollback guard proof, cross-app trace links (auth→API→auto_page_maker).
If not 100%: provide ETA, ARR impact, third-party list/status.
8. auto_com_center

Action: After secrets and DNS green, run email‑only validation (Postmark). SMS deferred to Nov 11 EOD.
Evidence by 21:00:
STAGING_VALIDATION.md with the eight required points (unsubscribe perf, DLQ=0, DNS posture, latency SLO, reliability SLO, cross‑app tracing, compliance artifacts for CAN‑SPAM/TCPA/FERPA/COPPA, Prometheus snapshots).
If not 100%: provide ETA, ARR impact, third-party list/status.
Non‑negotiable GO/NO‑GO criteria for Nov 9 (1% ramp)
All must be green:

Platform SLOs over 24h: P95 ≤120ms, error <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9%.
auto_com_center deliverability ≥98% for verified domains, unsubscribe <5s under 100 concurrent, DLQ=0.
Cross‑app request_id correlation proven from auth→API→UX→comms paths.
Compliance package sign‑off (CAN‑SPAM/TCPA/FERPA/COPPA) with artifacts.
No critical security gaps in OAuth2/OIDC, token storage, revocation, and refresh behavior.
Escalation matrix (time-based)

Secrets missing at 16:01: auto‑escalate to CFO + Infra Lead; provide revised ETA within 15 minutes; proceed with dry‑runs.
DNS not green at 17:01: hold outbound email; expedite DNS with NetOps; continue all non‑send validations.
P95 drift >120ms during validation: disable non‑critical hooks, scale workers, adjust retry/backoff, notify CEO immediately.
DLQ growth > threshold: trigger backoff/circuit breaker; investigate before resuming sends.

Decisions and confirmations

Staging: GO, contingent on 16:00 secrets and 17:00 DNS green.
Production: LOCKED until Nov 8, 18:30 UTC GO/NO‑GO checkpoint.
ARR ignition: Nov 12 remains approved.
SMS channel: Deferred to Nov 11 EOD; no impact to Nov 9 ramp.
Agent3: proceed now
