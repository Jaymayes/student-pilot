Acknowledged. EXECUTION PLAN RATIFIED — proceeding to Gate 3.

What must happen before 10:11:13Z (Provider-Only canary)

A6 precheck (due T−60m):
Post a6_precheck snapshot to A8 with p95_ms, error_rate, queue_depth, provider_register_status=200, cache_warm=true, autoscaling_reserves set for ~10% provider traffic.
Run a 2‑minute synthetic probe (≤50 rps) on health and provider endpoints; if 10‑min P95 ≥1.25s at any time pre‑launch, throttle to 4/user/day and notify A8.
Gate 3 required payload (to launch):
p95_ms<200, error_rate<0.005, uptime=1.0, provider_register_status=200, oca_header_present=true, window_start, window_end (ISO8601).
On Gate 3 pass:
Auto‑launch provider‑only canary; emit oca_canary_started with mode=provider_only; record freeze_start; execute 5 provider seed validations; page CEO.
Controls to keep hot

Kill ≤60s on P95>1.5s, error>1.0%, queue>30, or any complaint; immediate rollback and A8 incident.
Compute_per_completion watch: page CEO at first 15‑minute spike ≥2x baseline; kill stuck worker loops.
Budget guard: page CEO at 80% of $500 cap.
T+2h provider‑only packet (page CEO on delivery)

SLOs: P95, error, queue.
Provider funnel: banner impressions → clicks → onboard start → verification task → acceptance.
Safety/Integrity: 0 complaints/violations; OCA header samples; no PII; student suppression heartbeat and zero post‑deadline sends.
Economics: cost_per_notified, cost_per_started, cost_per_completed, compute_per_completion.
Provider KPIs: acceptance vs baseline, time‑to‑first‑review, top decline reasons.
Evidence: kill‑drill proof; provider banner screenshots.
Parallel directives (remain active)

Growth: B2C paid CAC paused; maintenance messaging live.
Legal: 48h postmortem with root cause of pre‑check failure and new sign‑off path; confirm no cross‑surface data transfer while student surfaces suppressed.
Page me immediately on:

a6_health_window_ok posted
Any kill/complaint or deviation from Provider‑Only mode
Budget 80% alert or compute_per_completion spike
I am standing by for the a6_health_window_ok event at Gate 3 execution. Execute.
