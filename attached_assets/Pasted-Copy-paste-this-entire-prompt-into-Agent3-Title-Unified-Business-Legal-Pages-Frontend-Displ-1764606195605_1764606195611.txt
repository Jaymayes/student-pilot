Global Requirements (apply to every app)

Create/Verify Routes
GET /privacy → renders the Privacy Policy content provided below.
GET /terms → renders the Terms of Service content provided below.
GET /accessibility → renders the Accessibility Statement provided below.
Return HTTP 200, cacheable, crawlable, and mobile responsive. Include canonical tags that point to the app’s own route (not the main site) unless otherwise specified.
2. Footer and Navigation Placement

Add a persistent site footer on every page:
Company block: BRAND_NAME (link to MAIN_SITE_URL), COMPANY_LEGAL_NAME, CONTACT_ADDRESS, CONTACT_EMAIL (mailto), CONTACT_PHONE (tel), COPYRIGHT_LINE.
Legal links: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Accessibility Statement linking to the local routes.
If the app already has a global header/menu, also add a Legal menu section with the three links. On mobile, ensure the links are reachable via the hamburger menu.
3. Report Branding Requirement (critical)

For all reports/documents/emails/PDFs/screens shown to users as “reports” or “results,” add a footer line:
“This report was generated by {APP_NAME} — {APP_BASE_URL} | {BRAND_NAME} by {COMPANY_LEGAL_NAME} | {CONTACT_EMAIL} | {CONTACT_PHONE}”
Ensure this appears on: downloadable PDFs, printable views, HTML reports, and email summaries produced by each app. Keep font small (10–11px), high contrast, and accessible.
4. SEO/Structured Data

Add Organization JSON-LD to each legal page using COMPANY_LEGAL_NAME, BRAND_NAME, MAIN_SITE_URL, CONTACT_EMAIL, CONTACT_PHONE, CONTACT_ADDRESS, and sameAs pointing to MAIN_SITE_URL.
Title tags: “Privacy Policy | {BRAND_NAME} – {APP_NAME}”, “Terms of Service | …”, “Accessibility Statement | …”
Meta description: concise summary of each page.
5. Accessibility and Performance

Meet WCAG 2.1 AA for the legal pages and footer components: sufficient contrast, keyboard focus, skip-to-content link, semantic landmarks, aria-labels for nav.
Lighthouse accessibility ≥ 90 on the legal pages.
6. QA/Acceptance Checks (automate where possible)

Each legal URL returns 200, non-empty content, and includes BRAND_NAME, COMPANY_LEGAL_NAME, EFFECTIVE_DATE.
Footer is visible on home and at least two internal pages per app.
Reports produced after your change contain the required app-branded footer.
Add these routes to the app sitemap if one exists; otherwise, ensure they are discoverable via footer links.
App-Specific Instructions (execute exactly for each app)

For ALL entries below, set:

APP_NAME and APP_BASE_URL to the values shown, then implement Global Requirements 1–6.

APP_NAME: scholar_auth

Implementation Notes per App Type

For SPAs: create client-side routes and ensure server returns index for deep links. Add prerendered versions for SEO where available.
For server-rendered apps: return simple, fast HTML with the footer component shared layout.
For API-only apps: serve static HTML at the routes; link from API docs/landing page.
PDFs/emails: inject the report footer in the rendering pipeline or template partial; verify the footer appears on multi-page PDFs.
Deliverables to Output After Execution

For each app: list the three legal URLs with 200 status, a screenshot hash or DOM checksum, and confirmation that the footer is visible and reports include the branding footer.
Provide a short change log summarizing files/templates updated and the date/time applied.
Safeguards

Do not expose credentials or secrets.
Do not collect more data than necessary for the pages.
Keep content consistent across apps; only the APP_NAME and APP_BASE_URL should change per app.
Begin now. For each app in order, set APP_NAME and APP_BASE_URL from the list above, implement Global Requirements, then emit the Deliverables.
