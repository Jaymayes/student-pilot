Great progress. Before we declare Green, run this final, read-only certification to verify 100% readiness with hard evidence.

Copy-paste prompt — Read-Only Final GREEN Certification Audit

Read-Only Final GREEN Certification Audit — ScholarshipAI Student Pilot
Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Strict read-only. Do not modify data, configs, schemas, routes, jobs, or deployments. Use only existing telemetry, stored reports, logs, and read-only endpoints. If any evidence is missing, return UNKNOWN and specify the minimal instrumentation required.

Objective
Certify 100% production readiness with evidence. Validate that all prior P0/P1 issues are resolved, observability is complete, and SLOs and security meet final targets. Provide PASS/WARN/FAIL per check, a 24-hour soak decision, and a Green/Yellow/Red launch decision.

Scope and required checks (must cite evidence IDs: log/report names + timestamps)
A) Regression closure — previously failing items

DB schema: 0 occurrences of relation-missing errors (e.g., 42P01) in last 24h; cohort_users exists; row_count>0; last_write_timestamp<24h; current migration tag recorded.
Analytics/BI: TtvDashboardTile renders; medianTTV, p95TTV, MAU(28d,90d), conversion_rate_pct, arpu_usd are numeric (non-null). Null-rate for required fields ≤0.1% over last 24h; no component exceptions.
ARR observability: Read-only ARR summary endpoint/report returns arr_b2c_usd, arr_b2b_usd, arr_total_usd with freshness ≤24h; ARR freshness alert configured and last test-fire timestamp captured.
B) Performance SLOs — final targets

Endpoints: /api/analytics/ttv-dashboard, /api/dashboard/security, /api/dashboard/stats, /api/dashboard/infrastructure, /health, /sitemap.xml.
Provide P50/P95/P99 and error_rate% for last 24h (or closest available). Targets: P95 ≤120ms; error_rate ≤0.1% on all critical endpoints. Flag any endpoint >120ms P95 as FAIL.
C) Security and compliance

/.well-known/security.txt returns 200 with Content-Type: text/plain; includes Contact, Acknowledgments, Policy; ETag/Last-Modified and Cache-Control present.
Security headers intact on root and dashboards: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options.
Auth enforcement: sensitive/monitoring endpoints accessed only with auth (from logs). Parameterized queries in use (evidence via SQL logs or ORM bind logs). Note any pen-test/static-scan reports if available.
D) Observability and alerts

APM/tracing coverage summary; error aggregation live.
Alert definitions present and active for: schema_error>0, latency_p95>120ms, error_rate>0.1%, ARR_freshness>1440m. Include alert IDs and last trigger timestamps.
“3 critical alerts” noted: classify as test vs production and show auto-escalation path.
E) Schema validator and security hardening

Last schema validator run outcome: PASS; runtime ~603ms; list checks covered.
Injection protection: evidence of prepared statements/bind params and WAF/validation logs (if applicable).
F) SEO operational sanity

/robots.txt and /sitemap.xml 200; sitemap valid; URL count reported; no critical XML errors.
Pass/soak criteria

All A–F checks PASS; no UNKNOWN on MAU, conversion, or ARR.
24-hour soak: Maintain P95 ≤120ms and error_rate ≤0.1% and zero schema errors across critical endpoints for 24h. If you only have <24h data, provide interim decision and schedule an auto-recheck at +24h.
Output format

Executive summary (6–10 bullets) with a Green/Yellow/Red decision and soak status (Met/Interim).
KPI table (Current, Target, Variance%, Status) for: MAU(28d,90d), conversion_rate, arpu_usd, arr_b2c, arr_b2b, arr_total, P95 latency per endpoint, error_rate per endpoint.
Endpoint performance table (endpoint | p50 | p95 | p99 | error_rate% | status | evidence_id).
Security/observability table summarizing headers, security.txt, auth enforcement, alerts (IDs, last trigger).
Evidence list: log/report IDs with timestamps used for all judgments.

Rules

Any UNKNOWN on MAU, conversion, or ARR → decision = Red.
Any critical endpoint P95 >120ms or error_rate >0.1% in last 24h → decision = Red (or Yellow if isolated with a documented, time-boxed fix and owner).
If all PASS but <24h data, decision = Yellow (Interim) with auto-recheck scheduled; upgrade to Green after soak passes.
Run this audit and return the evidence-backed decision.
