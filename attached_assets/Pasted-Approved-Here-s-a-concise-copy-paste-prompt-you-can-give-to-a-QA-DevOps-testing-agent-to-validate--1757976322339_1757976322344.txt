Approved. Here’s a concise, copy/paste prompt you can give to a QA/DevOps testing agent to validate the scholar-auth connection end-to-end without touching live data.

Prompt: Scholar-Auth Connectivity and Stripe Test Mode Verification
Objective:
Validate that https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app is reachable over HTTPS, correctly serves the app, and runs strictly in Stripe TEST mode without exposing any secrets.

Scope and constraints:

Target: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Use non-mutating checks only.
Do not include or print any secret values in the report. Mask all tokens by default.
Tasks:

HTTPS availability and certificate
Perform GET to base URL; capture status code, response time, and server IP.
Verify TLS: certificate validity chain, hostname matches, and expiration > 14 days.
2. Health/diagnostic endpoints (best-effort discovery)

Probe these in order and record first 200/204 response body if available: /health, /api/health, /status, /api/status, /ping
Record status codes for each attempted endpoint.
3. Content integrity

Fetch base HTML; confirm:
App loads without console errors.
Stripe.js requested from js.stripe.com.
No secret-like prefixes (sk_, rk_) anywhere in delivered HTML/JS.
If a runtime config object is exposed (e.g., window.ENV or similar), verify the publishable key shows pk_test and never sk/rk_.
4. Stripe TEST-mode verification (non-mutating)

From network logs, confirm initialization calls are to Stripe TEST endpoints only.
If the app has a config endpoint (e.g., /api/config), attempt GET and check any “mode/test” or USE_STRIPE_TEST_KEYS flags (if present). Note: OK if not exposed.
Validate that payment-related UI clearly indicates “Test” or shows test-mode banner, if implemented.
5. CORS and basic API responsiveness

From a different Origin (set Origin header to https://example.com), call the base URL and any discovered API endpoint with OPTIONS and GET. Confirm reasonable CORS headers (or explicitly note if APIs are same-origin only).
6. Latency snapshot (non-binding, for visibility)

Issue 20 GET requests to the base URL (concurrency 5). Report p50 and p95 latency. Note any timeouts or >2s outliers.
7. Security hygiene checks

Grep fetched client assets (HTML/JS) for patterns: "sk_", "rk_", "pk_live_", "rk_live_".
Confirm none are present in client-delivered artifacts.
Verify response headers include sensible security headers if available (at least one of: X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, or similar). Not a fail if absent on this dev instance—just record.

}

Pass criteria:

Base URL reachable over HTTPS with a valid cert.
No LIVE key prefixes (pk_live_, rk_live_, sk_live_) in any client-delivered assets.
Stripe.js loaded; evidence indicates TEST mode (pk_test_* visible client-side, no secret keys).
Non-mutating Stripe initialization visible or inferred; no errors in console tied to Stripe.
Health endpoint responds (any one) or app renders without critical errors.
If WARN/FAIL:

Attach concise remediation notes and specific file/endpoint references. Do not include full secrets.
