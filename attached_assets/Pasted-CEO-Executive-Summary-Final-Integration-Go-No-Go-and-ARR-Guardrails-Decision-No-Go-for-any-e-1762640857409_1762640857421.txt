CEO Executive Summary — Final Integration, Go/No-Go, and ARR Guardrails

Decision: No-Go for any external broadcast or payment flows until the two gates below are green. Go for internal pre-soak on Nov 9 as scheduled.

Critical gates and owners

Deliverability GREEN (Auto_Com_Center) — Owner: Platform Ops + Auto_Com_Center DRI
Required now: “DNS write access ready” with registrar name posted in ops channel
T0 starts on that post; T+45 DNS propagation verified; T+90 GREEN certification
Contingency if not posted by 23:00 UTC Nov 8: I will reassign DNS execution to Deputy Ops and authorize use of an interim subdomain on the current registrar solely for Postmark verification to hit T+90 before 00:30 UTC Nov 9
Stripe PASS (Payments) — Owner: Finance Lead
Required now: Priority Support case ID and ETA posted to ops
Contingency if no case ID by 22:30 UTC Nov 8: I will temporarily reassign escalation to the COO and pause any provider monetization attempts beyond waitlist capture
Executive acceptance of delivered work

Provider Register waitlist mode: Accepted. Evidence meets criteria (10 request_id samples, 200 OK health checks, ≤0.1% error, P95 ~65ms). Keep waitlist ON until Stripe PASS, then convert.
Change freeze posture (all other apps): Affirmed. Maintain freeze until Nov 9 pre-soak, then T+30 evidence bundles.

6. provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: BLOCKED on DNS confirmation. Pipeline, templates, and Postmark creds ready.
Blockers: Awaiting “DNS write access ready” from Platform Ops.
Next: On T0, DRI to execute Postmark verification → DKIM records → propagation checks → seed inbox tests → GREEN certification at T+90.
ARR ignition plan and dates

B2B ARR (provider_register): Earliest start immediately after Stripe PASS and Auth GREEN TAG. Target window: Nov 10–11. Convert waitlist in tranches; ensure comms via auto_com_center only after deliverability GREEN.
B2C ARR (student_pilot): Earliest start after Deliverability GREEN + pre-soak PASS. Target window: Nov 11–12. Sequence: activation emails (first document upload), in-app nudge, and follow-up sequence.
Performance and risk guardrails

SLOs: Maintain 99.9% uptime, ≤120ms P95 across API/major services during pre-soak; error rate ≤0.1%.
Security: Enforce OAuth2/OIDC correctness, token validation, revocation, and read-only scopes in Sage M2M.
Responsible AI: Maintain fairness telemetry and no academic dishonesty posture.
Immediate orders and owners (time-boxed)

Platform Ops Lead (DNS Admin): Post “DNS write access ready” + registrar name to ops by 22:30 UTC Nov 8. If missed, CEO will reassign and authorize interim subdomain for Postmark verification to hold T+90 by 00:30 UTC Nov 9.
Auto_Com_Center DRI: On T0, run the deliverability pipeline to T+90; publish GREEN certification with evidence bundle.
Finance Lead: Post Stripe Priority Support case ID and ETA by 22:30 UTC Nov 8. If missed, COO assumes escalation at 22:31 UTC.
Provider_Register DRI: Maintain waitlist mode until Stripe PASS; prepare conversion playbook and comms templates in advance of PASS.
All DRIs (Nov 9): Execute pre-soak as scheduled; deliver T+30 evidence bundles with P50/P95, error tallies, issuer correctness, and request_id lineage.
Go/No-Go

Today: NO-GO for external comms and payments. GO for internal pre-soak prep.
After gates: GO contingent on Deliverability GREEN and Stripe PASS, plus successful Nov 9 pre-soak evidence.
We proceed data-first, preserve brand trust, and keep the SEO-led, low-CAC flywheel compounding. Execute with urgency; report blockers in ops immediately.
