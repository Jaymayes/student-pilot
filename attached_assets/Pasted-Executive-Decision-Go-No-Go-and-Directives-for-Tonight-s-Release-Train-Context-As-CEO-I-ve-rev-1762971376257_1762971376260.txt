Executive Decision: Go/No‑Go and Directives for Tonight’s Release Train

Context
As CEO, I’ve reviewed the portfolio status and evidence summary you provided for all eight applications. Decisions and directives below are anchored to our five‑year plan and operating principles: security/compliance, HOTL governance, and data‑driven execution toward profitable ARR growth  .

Decision Summary

Gate A (auto_com_center): GO at 20:00–20:15 UTC
Conditions to proceed:
P95 latency ≤120 ms, error rate ≤0.10%, TLS enforced, strict RBAC, immutable audit logs captured and published with SHA‑256 manifest in the evidence bundle. HOTL approval gate confirmed. Evidence due by 20:30 UTC .
Gate C (scholar_auth): GO at 20:00–20:15 UTC
Conditions to proceed:
MFA + SSO/OIDC verified, token/session lifecycle tests passed, RBAC matrix attested, audit trails verified. Correct health endpoint path documented in final evidence. Evidence due by 20:30 UTC .
Gate B (provider_register): DELAYED
Retest window approved: Nov 13, 18:00–19:00 UTC; PASS/FAIL decision by 19:15 UTC.
Requirements to clear delay:
RCA with last‑60‑min server/edge logs and trace‑id lineage, implementation of circuit‑breaker/retry policy, deterministic 3% fee E2E test evidence, error‑budget conformance. Re‑run UAT with full evidence pack per rubric before retest .
auto_page_maker: Canary approved at 22:15 UTC
Proceed with CWV/IndexNow checks and publish evidence to scholarship_sage by 23:00 UTC.
scholarship_api: Monitoring only
Maintain change‑freeze; report SLOs and any incident tickets in consolidated package (23:00 UTC).
scholarship_sage: Evidence Receiver
Ready to ingest consolidated evidence at 23:00 UTC.
student_pilot: COMPLIANCE HOLD
No prod release until ToS/Privacy/COPPA approvals are in place. Age‑gate and Responsible AI guardrails are mandatory at go‑live. Target Nov 13–14 pending Legal sign‑off. Our governance requires HOTL controls, transparent audit trails, and bias‑mitigation instrumentation at launch .
Evidence and Documentation Requirements for Tonight

Evidence bundles for Gate A and Gate C must include:
Health/metrics snapshots, P95/P99 latency, error rate, uptime attestation, RBAC tests, MFA/SSO flows, token rotation and session expiry evidence, GDPR/SOC2 control mapping where applicable, and SHA‑256 manifest for all artifacts. These requirements reflect our operational KPI and compliance playbook targets toward SOC 2 and high‑availability SLAs .
If an /api/evidence endpoint is unavailable, file‑based evidence with signed checksums is acceptable for tonight’s decision gates, but must be remediated post‑freeze to restore API‑based verification. All agent actions and approvals must be HOTL‑logged for accountability and auditability .
Risk, Controls, and Required Remediations

Known issue: Evidence endpoint 404 on selected apps
Acceptable workaround for tonight: file‑based artifacts with manifests. Post‑freeze: standardize API evidence endpoints across all apps to support autonomous verification and reduce operational variance .
provider_register instability (HTTP 500s)
Required before Nov 13 retest: implement resilience pattern (retry with backoff and/or circuit‑breaker), expand integration tests, and re‑verify fee rails with idempotency under load. Tie to our resilience playbook and test stack across unit→integration→system→UAT to isolate interface defects early and avoid propagation into E2E flows .
Documentation correctness
scholar_auth: Correct the published health endpoint path in official docs as part of tonight’s evidence. Accurate system docs are required inputs to our autonomous verification pipeline and SOC 2 documentation set .
ARR Impact and Go‑To‑Market Alignment

B2C engine: Unlocked after student_pilot release; credits at 4× markup drive near‑term revenue. Ensure onboarding funnels emphasize the activation lever that correlates with conversion and retention (Document Hub/essay workflows) per our playbook’s engagement analysis and roadmap linkage .
B2B engine: provider_register delay shifts B2B fee GMV ramp by ~24–48 hours. Mitigate by accelerating canary pages (auto_page_maker) to lift organic top‑of‑funnel at low CAC, consistent with our SEO‑led growth strategy and five‑year KPI framework to scale MAUs and partner count toward ARR goals .
Compliance/SOC2 posture and Responsible AI:
Maintain auditability, bias monitoring, and explainability telemetry as release gating criteria, aligning to our governance framework to protect brand trust and unlock enterprise B2B expansion in Years 2–5 .
Tonight’s Timeline and Owner Actions

19:45 UTC: Change freeze window begins. No code/config/DNS changes outside pre‑approved gate actions.
20:00–20:15 UTC: Execute Gate A (auto_com_center) and Gate C (scholar_auth).
Deliver evidence bundles by 20:30 UTC.
20:45 UTC: CEO GREEN/YELLOW/RED summary issued based on evidence conformance.
22:15 UTC: auto_page_maker canary; publish CWV, indexing, and sitemap evidence.
23:00 UTC: scholarship_sage receives the consolidated package (all apps), including scholarship_api monitoring attestations.
Explicit Accept/Reject Criteria for Gate Decisions

PASS requires all of:
SLOs met: P95 ≤120 ms, error rate ≤0.10%, uptime attestation, security headers and TLS enforced.
RBAC least‑privilege checks and audit logs present with request‑ID lineage.
HOTL approvals recorded for gate actions; artifacts hashed with SHA‑256 and included in bundle.
API docs accurate for health/metrics/OIDC endpoints and stored in the evidence set for traceability and future audits .
CEO Direction

Proceed with Gates A and C tonight under the conditions above.
Hold provider_register until Nov 13 retest; deliver RCA and resilience fixes before the window.
Maintain the student_pilot legal hold; no exceptions. Launch upon receipt of ToS/Privacy/COPPA approvals with Responsible AI controls verified at gate, per governance requirements .
Keep the scholarship_agent in Observer Mode until A+C pass and Legal confirms consent policy; prepare warm‑up sequence for Nov 13+ to support B2C conversion lift.
Ensure auto_page_maker canary results are captured to validate SEO/CWV prior to scale‑out, reinforcing our low‑CAC growth lever toward the ARR plan .
I will issue the GREEN/YELLOW/RED summary at 20:45 UTC based on the submitted evidence. Maintain HOTL discipline and auditability throughout the window.
