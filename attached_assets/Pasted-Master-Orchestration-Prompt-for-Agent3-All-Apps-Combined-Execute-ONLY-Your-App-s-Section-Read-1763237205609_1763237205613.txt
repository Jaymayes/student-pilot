Master Orchestration Prompt for Agent3 (All Apps Combined) — Execute ONLY Your App’s Section

Read this carefully. You will see requirements for all eight apps. You must only act on the section that matches the app workspace you are currently in. Do not modify or create deliverables for any other app.

Global Objectives (Apply to your app only)

Goal: Get your app 100% production-ready and integrated with the rest of the platform TODAY. If that’s not possible, deliver:
Earliest ETA to go live (UTC, precise date/time)
ARR ignition date (UTC) with a quantified contribution rationale
Third-party and cross-app dependencies, owners, and exact actions required
SLOs: 99.9% uptime, ≤120ms P95 API latency (or TTFB ≤120ms for SSR pages)
Responsible AI: No academic dishonesty features. Bias mitigation, explainability (where relevant), transparency, PII redaction.

Workspace Self-Check (Mandatory First Step for your app)

Identify your app and base URL:
Detect app from environment/config and print summary.
Verify GET /health returns 200 and includes app name and version.
Evidence inventory:
Count existing evidence files for your app in evidence/ to avoid duplication.
Output the Self-Check summary before executing tasks:
Detected App, APP_BASE_URL, Section Match status, Health Status, Version.
Required Deliverables (Produce for your app only; overwrite or create fresh)

File naming (no spaces): evidence/EXEC_STATUS_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
The first two lines of EVERY report must be EXACTLY: APP NAME: <app> APP_BASE_URL: <base_url>
Required set (5 files):
EXEC_STATUS_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
Current health, version, environment, uptime snapshot
SLO verification (P95 latency and uptime approach)
Security posture (CORS exact-origin, rate limits, CSP, PII redaction, secrets)
Observability (health probes, logs, correlation IDs, error tracking)
E2E_REPORT_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
End-to-end flows tested with timestamps and sample I/O
Cross-app calls validated (list each endpoint hit)
Performance measurements (cold/warm), caching behavior (if applicable)
TEST_MATRIX_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
Comprehensive test catalog: must-have endpoints, security checks, rate limits, error cases, webhooks (if any)
Pass/fail with notes and remediation items
GO_DECISION_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
Decision: GO, CONDITIONAL GO (DRY_RUN), or NO-GO
If not GO today: earliest ETA (UTC), ARR ignition date (UTC), full blocker list (owner, action, ETA)
Risk matrix and rollback plan
SECTIONXCOMPLIANCE_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md (replace X with your section number)
Map each “Must-Have Today” requirement to evidence (endpoint outputs, logs, or screenshots/IDs)
Note any gaps, severity, and exact remediation plan/time
Common Technical Must-Haves (Implement/verify on your app)

Health endpoints:
GET /health → 200 OK with {status, app, version}
GET /readyz or /.well-known/ready → 200 OK with deep checks
GET /version → 200 OK with standalone JSON {version, git_sha, build_time}
CORS: Exact-origin allowlist to only the eight platform origins shown above (no wildcards).
Rate limiting on public endpoints; document limits in TEST_MATRIX.
Logging: Structured JSON, correlation/request IDs, PII redaction, no secret leakage.
Security headers: CSP, HSTS (HTTPS only), X-Frame-Options, etc.
Idempotency for write operations and outbound webhooks/notifications.
Latency: Measure and report P50/P95 for critical endpoints; ensure ≤120ms P95 target (or document gap with ETA).
GO/NO-GO Decisioning

GO TODAY if all must-haves and cross-app integrations pass.
CONDITIONAL GO (DRY_RUN) if external credentials/DNS are pending but internal flows are safe to test.
NO-GO if critical user flows are broken; include precise ETA, ARR ignition date, third-party requirements.
Always include the app’s self-identification header in the GO_DECISION report and summarize ARR impact with conservative assumptions.

Blocker list (each with: dependency, owner, exact action, ETA)
Earliest ETA to full GO (UTC, precise timestamp)
ARR ignition date (UTC) and expected contribution band with assumptions
Cross-App Contracts: In E2E_REPORT and SECTIONXCOMPLIANCE, show exact URLs invoked, payload schemas, and sample correlation IDs.
Performance Evidence: Include simple latency measurements (curl with time_total or app logs). Report P50 and P95 where feasible.
Rollback: In GO_DECISION, include a 3-step rollback plan and health-check gating.
Final Output Requirements (Your app only)

Print the Workspace Self-Check summary.
Then generate/update the 5 deliverables with the exact two-line header at the top of each: APP NAME: <your_app_name> APP_BASE_URL: <your_app_base_url>
Conclude with a short GO/CONDITIONAL/NO-GO summary inline, including:
Today’s status
If not GO: earliest ETA to GO (UTC), ARR ignition date, third-party and internal dependencies with owners and actions
Remember: Only execute the section matching your current app workspace. Ignore all other sections.
