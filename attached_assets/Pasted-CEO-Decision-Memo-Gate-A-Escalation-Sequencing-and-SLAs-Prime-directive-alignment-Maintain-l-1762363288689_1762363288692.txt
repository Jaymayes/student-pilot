CEO Decision Memo – Gate A Escalation, Sequencing, and SLAs

Prime directive alignment: Maintain low-CAC SEO growth, protect student trust, ship evidence-first. We are in a Conditional GO across the stack. The only P0 blocker to the Gate A chain is scholar_auth not registering provider_register’s OAuth client. We will clear this now, then run the event chain through Order B → Order 4 → +2 SEO pages, with evidence at each step. Messaging remains in staging-only posture pending DNS/A2P approvals.

Immediate CEO Orders (timeboxed)

P0 Escalation – scholar_auth (Owner: Auth DRI)

Deadline: 10 minutes from receipt
Action: Register OAuth client “provider-register” with the configuration provided by provider_register DRI (authorization_code + refresh_token, PKCE=S256, Provider role).
Acceptance tests:
The authorization URL for client_id=provider-register returns the consent page (not invalid_client).
JWKS token validation and RBAC=Provider confirmed in logs with request_id.
Evidence required:
e2e/reports/scholar_auth/PROVIDER_REGISTER_CLIENT_REGISTRATION.md
Include exact client record (secrets redacted), curl test output, request_id.
If missed: Move to HOLD and re-baseline the Gate A window; no demo-mode bypass approved.
Order B – provider_register (Owner: Provider DRI)

Trigger: On scholar_auth registration PASS
Deadline: 20 minutes after unblock
Action: Execute end-to-end provider login with PKCE, create/manage a listing via scholarship_api with Provider role.
Acceptance tests:
OAuth redirect, token exchange, RBAC=Provider scoped calls to scholarship_api.
/health returns 200 with dependency checks.
Evidence required:
e2e/reports/provider_register/ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md
Screens, request_id chain, Sentry trace, P95 ≤120ms.
Order 4 – scholarship_api (Owner: API DRI)

Trigger: On Order B PASS
Deadline: 20 minutes post-trigger
Action: Create and activate 2 scholarships; emit scholarship_created events to auto_page_maker with request_id propagation.
Acceptance tests:
Write P95 ≤150ms during creation; Read P95 ≤120ms; error rate <0.1%.
Event emission confirmed; Sentry traces linked across components.
Evidence required:
e2e/reports/scholarship_api/ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md
Include payload hashes, IDs, timings, and request_id chain.
Event-Driven +2 Pages – auto_page_maker (Owner: APM DRI)

Trigger: On scholarship_api event
Deadline: 60 seconds post-event; evidence within 10 minutes
Action: Generate 2 pages; update sitemap; push IndexNow; export metrics.
Acceptance tests:
CWV p75 GREEN; P95 ≤120ms; pages_total incremented by +2.
Evidence required:
e2e/reports/auto_page_maker/ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md
Sitemap diff, IndexNow receipts, CWV and P95 metrics, request_id chain.
Staging Validation – auto_com_center (Owner: Comms DRI; Infra DRI supporting)

Posture: HOLD for production sends
Infra delivery deadline: 15 minutes from receipt
SENTRY_DSN (raw URL)
AWS SQS + DLQ credentials/IAM policy
Postmark + Twilio secrets in secrets manager
DNS records for SPF/DKIM/DMARC on mail.scholaraiadvisor.com
After secrets delivery: T+15 to run staging validation
Acceptance tests:
Unsubscribe SLA <5s; P95 ≤120ms; DLQ=0; queue_depth metrics exported.
Evidence required:
e2e/reports/auto_com_center/staging_validation.md
e2e/reports/auto_com_center/DNS_EVIDENCE.md
Prometheus metrics snapshot and Sentry trace links.
CEO note: 1% production ramp remains NOT APPROVED until DNS/A2P verified and staging validation passes.
M2M for Recommendations – scholarship_sage (Owner: Auth DRI + Sage DRI)

Status: M2M client is configured; finalize secret distribution
Auth DRI deadline: 10 minutes
Generate and load M2M_SCHOLARSHIP_SAGE_SECRET; distribute via approved secure channel.
Evidence: e2e/reports/scholar_auth/M2M_SECRET_DISTRIBUTION.md
Sage DRI deadline: Start 48-hour baseline immediately upon secret receipt
Observe-only posture; no outbound messaging.
Evidence (due at +48h): e2e/reports/scholarship_sage/baseline_metrics_evidence.md
Must include precision@5 methodology, early measurements, coverage %, matchReasons samples, and request_id chains.
Student Frontend – student_pilot (Owner: Student DRI)

Posture: Green; continue weekly cohort reporting and accessibility remediation plan
Evidence cadence: Keep CEO markdown endpoint live and accurate
KPI focus: Activation ≥50%, median time-to-activation ≤24h
Cross-Cutting Requirements (all apps)

Reporting header: APP_NAME | APP_BASE_URL in every artifact and log context.
Observability: Sentry 10% performance sampling, PII redaction, request_id propagation. Confirm /health OK with dependency checks.
Security/Privacy: HTTPS only; scholar_auth token validation via JWKS; RBAC enforced; FERPA/COPPA alignment; audit logs active.
Payments: Stripe remains at 0% rollout until Phase 3.
Approvals and Holds

auto_com_center: Production messaging NOT APPROVED. Staging-only until SPF/DKIM/DMARC and A2P 10DLC verified and staging validation passes. A later 1% ramp requires my explicit sign-off.
auto_page_maker: GO on event; constrained by upstream triggers; proceed immediately once Order 4 fires.
scholarship_api RDS Migration: Proceed per plan; deliver RDS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md by the stated deadline; include rollback steps and zero-downtime strategy.
Stripe: Hold at 0% until Dec 16 go-live window.
Risks and Mitigations

Risk: OAuth client registration delays the entire Gate A chain.
Mitigation: P0 escalation with 10-minute SLA; no demo-mode bypass approved to preserve security posture and audit integrity.
Risk: Messaging compliance (DNS/A2P) delays.
Mitigation: Keep production sends locked; Infra DRI timeboxed to 15 minutes for secrets; publish DNS evidence on completion.
Risk: Data privacy/FERPA scope creep for recommendations.
Mitigation: Enforce read:students_anonymized scope; audit access; matchReasons required in all responses.
KPI Guardrails I am watching in this window

P95 latency: ≤120ms across all public/user flows; ≤150ms writes on scholarship creation.
SEO engine: +2 pages event-driven; CWV p75 GREEN; pages_total/indexed_total evidence.
B2C activation: Activation ≥50%, median ≤24h; student_pilot reporting live.
Error rate: <0.1% across apps; Sentry traces with request_id correlation.
Checkpoints

T+10 minutes: scholar_auth OAuth client registration evidence posted; if missed, we move Gate A to HOLD and re-timebox. No conditional pass.
T+30 minutes: Expect Order B evidence; if posted, scholarship_api executes Order 4 within 20 minutes; auto_page_maker +2 pages within 60 seconds of event.
Staging validation for auto_com_center: Run immediately after secrets; evidence posted within the hour.
scholarship_sage: Start 48-hour baseline the moment the M2M secret is delivered; evidence due at +48h.
Final CEO Notes

We operate evidence-first. If it’s not in e2e/reports with request_id chains and Sentry traces, it’s not done.
Protect the low-CAC SEO engine. Do not compromise security or compliance for speed; our compounding growth depends on trust.
Act with urgency, but keep the chain-of-custody tight. No demo bypasses for auth.
I will be back on the channel in 30 minutes for the next checkpoint or sooner if the P0 unblock is confirmed earlier.
