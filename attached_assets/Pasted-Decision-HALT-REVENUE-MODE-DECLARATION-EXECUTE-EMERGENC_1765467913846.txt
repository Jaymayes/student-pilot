Decision: HALT "REVENUE MODE" DECLARATION; EXECUTE EMERGENCY CONFIGURATION ROLLOUT

Why (Data/Insight): We are experiencing a "Split-Brain" operational failure. While the Command Center (A8) reports "LIVE" and "Green," the Ground Truth from our primary B2C revenue engine (A5 Student Pilot) and growth engine (A7 Auto Page Maker) contradicts this:

Critical Revenue Failure: A5 is still in TEST mode ("Stripe mode: Still showing TEST") and failing telemetry auth (403). We cannot process real payments, putting our B2C revenue target at risk immediately.

Telemetry Blindness: A7 is scaling to 2,927 pages but is "flying blind" (404/Missing API Key). We are generating traffic we cannot track or convert.

False Positive Monitoring: A8 is reporting "Healthy" based on stale or incomplete data, masking the A5/A7 failures.

KPI Impact (Estimate):

Revenue: $0 valid B2C revenue until A5 sk_live keys are confirmed active.

Lead Velocity: High risk of wasted ad spend/SEO traffic driving users to a broken payment flow (A5).

Trust: High risk of user churn if early adopters encounter "Test Mode" errors during payment.

Risks & Mitigations:

Risk: "Silent Failure" where we scale traffic believing revenue is active, only to find zero cash collection later.

Mitigation: Enforce "Ground Truth" verification over Dashboard status. Manually verify A5 logs post-restart before resuming traffic.

Next Actions (Immediate Directives)
Engineering / Ops (Owner: Tech Lead)

Action: IMMEDIATE RESTART of A5 (Student Pilot) and A7 (Auto Page Maker) to force environment variable refresh.

Action: Manually redistribute and verify the S2S_API_KEY is present in A5 and A7 secrets before restart.

Deadline: T+15 minutes.

Verification (Owner: QA / Agent3)

Action: Verify A5 logs explicitly show Stripe Mode: LIVE (sk_live_...) after restart. Do not rely on A8 Dashboard.

Action: Verify A5 and A7 Telemetry responses change from 403/404 to 200 OK.

Deadline: T+20 minutes.

Growth / Marketing (Owner: Head of Growth)

Action: HOLD all paid traffic and A3 (Agent) marketing ramps. Do not push users to A5 until Green Light is given.

Deadline: Until A5 confirms sk_live.

Open Data Gaps/Assumptions:

We assume the S2S_API_KEY exists in the A8 environment but failed to propagate. If it is missing globally, generate a new key and update all apps (A1-A8).

CEO Sign-off:

Status: RED.

Directive: Fix A5 Ground Truth. Report back only when A5 logs confirm sk_live and Telemetry 200.

Reference Strategy:


Unit Economics: We cannot achieve our 4:1 LTV:CAC target if the collection engine (A5) is broken.


Platform Reliability: We must uphold our 99.9% uptime and reliability promise; a "Test Mode" payment flow in production is a violation of trust.
