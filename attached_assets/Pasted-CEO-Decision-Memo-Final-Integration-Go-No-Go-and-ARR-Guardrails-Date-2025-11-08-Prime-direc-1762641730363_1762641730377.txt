CEO Decision Memo — Final Integration, Go/No‑Go, and ARR Guardrails
Date: 2025-11-08

Prime directive alignment: Preserve brand trust, protect the SEO-led low-CAC flywheel, and move decisively toward ARR ignition while holding a strict evidence bar.

Executive decisions

Go/No-Go: No external broadcasts or payment flows until both gates are green: Deliverability GREEN (auto_com_center) and Stripe PASS. Internal pre‑soak on Nov 9 proceeds as scheduled under the existing change freeze and SLO guardrails.
SLO guardrails for pre‑soak: 99.9% uptime; ≤120ms P95 across major services; ≤0.1% error rate; strict OAuth2/OIDC correctness, token validation, and revocation; documented request_id lineage end‑to‑end.
Contingencies and escalations

Gate 1: DNS access for deliverability

If “DNS write access ready” is not posted by 23:00 UTC: I am reassigning to Deputy Ops to provision an interim subdomain under a zone with confirmed write access. Deputy Ops is authorized to proceed immediately with SPF, DKIM (both selectors), and DMARC records required by Postmark. Auto_Com_Center DRI will treat interim subdomain verification as T0 and run the T0→T+90 pipeline.
If access is posted before 23:00 UTC: Auto_Com_Center DRI proceeds with the existing T0 plan and timelines.
Gate 2: Stripe PASS

If Priority Support case ID was not posted by 22:30 UTC: The COO now owns escalation. Actions: open/upgrade Priority Support case, post case ID and ETA in ops, and provide go/no-go recommendation on the first monetization tranche by 10:00 UTC Nov 9. Provider_register stays in waitlist mode until Stripe PASS is confirmed.
Application status acceptance (final pre‑soak posture)

scholar_auth — https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (Frozen). Participate in Nov 9 pre‑soak; produce latency/error evidence and revocation checks.
scholarship_api — https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (Frozen). Participate in Nov 9 pre‑soak; deliver P50/P95, 401/5xx handling, PKCE/M2M conformance, issuer correctness, and request_id lineage.
scholarship_agent — https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (Frozen, observe‑only). Fairness telemetry on; no autonomous external comms until gates are green.
scholarship_sage — https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (Frozen). Read‑only scopes enforced. M2M issuer switch during config window; deliver scope enforcement + latency evidence.
student_pilot — https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (Ready/Blocked; Frozen). Activation anchor = first document upload. Participate in pre‑soak; T+30 E2E evidence on activation funnel.
provider_register — https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (Waitlist ON). Evidence accepted. Hold waitlist until Stripe PASS; prepare conversion playbook as directed below.
auto_page_maker — https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (Frozen; monitor‑only). Preserve stability to protect SEO flywheel. Daily KPI rollup only; no changes through Nov 12.
auto_com_center — https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: BLOCKED pending DNS access confirmation. On T0, execute T0→T+90 deliverability pipeline and deliver GREEN certification with evidence.
Evidence deliverables and timing

Nov 9 pre‑soak (all applicable DRIs): Deliver T+30 evidence bundles including P50/P95 latency histograms, error tallies, issuer correctness, PKCE/M2M validation, and request_id lineage.
auto_com_center (on T0): T+45 DNS verification complete; T+90 GREEN deliverability certification with proof (SPF/DKIM/DMARC, seed inbox placement ≥90%, headers PASS, blocklist checks, bounce rate <0.5%).
Central ops: Maintain a single, time‑stamped evidence index link with all artifacts attached within 15 minutes of each milestone.
ARR ignition plan (earliest windows; contingent)

B2B (provider_register): Earliest Nov 10–11 after Stripe PASS + Auth GREEN TAG. Convert waitlist in tranches; comms only after deliverability GREEN.
B2C (student_pilot): Earliest Nov 11–12 after Deliverability GREEN + pre‑soak PASS. Sequence: activation email for first document upload → in‑app nudge → follow‑up.
Risk and ethics guardrails

Comply with FERPA/COPPA and Responsible AI commitments: bias telemetry, transparency, and no academic dishonesty. Privacy and token scope minimization enforced.
Directive on the conversion playbook (provider_register DRI)

Prepare now; do not send externally until both gates are green.
Deliver a concise, execution‑ready playbook by 12:00 UTC Nov 9 including:
Tranche plan: cohort sizing, prioritization criteria, and pacing (with rollback triggers).
Messaging: email and in‑app templates (subject lines, preheaders, body, CTAs) with UTM conventions; suppression and unsubscribe handling.
Payments: post‑Stripe PASS flow, webhooks, and dunning/retry policy; success/abort criteria.
Ops checks: pre‑send checklist (rate limits, sending domain warmup, seed tests), monitoring dashboards, and on‑call matrix.
KPIs: conversion rate targets, refund thresholds, CAC guardrails, and daily reporting cadence.
Confirm readiness in ops once the playbook is posted. Execution will not begin until Deliverability GREEN and Stripe PASS are confirmed.
Immediate confirmations requested in ops

Platform Ops or Deputy Ops: Confirm which DNS path is active (primary vs. interim subdomain) and declare T0 start time for auto_com_center.
COO: Post Stripe case ID, current status, and ETA. If already posted, reconfirm and state next checkpoint.
Agent3: Post a consolidated status ticker (single message) listing each app with GREEN/FROZEN/READY/BLOCKED and the next timestamped deliverable.
Answer to Agent3’s question

Yes—prepare the conversion playbook now per the directives above; stand by for gate updates before any external execution.
