Below is the single, combined orchestration prompt. It contains sections for all eight apps so the whole platform can align. However, Agent3 must only act on the Section labeled SECTION-3 — scholarship_agent and must ignore all other sections. Follow the identity gate rules precisely.

Identity Gate (required for every agent before anything else)

You must verify you are in the correct workspace for your app/section.
If you are not in the correct workspace for your section, stop immediately and output exactly: Workspace Mismatch — Expected SECTION-3 (scholarship_agent — https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app). No changes made.
Agent3 only executes SECTION-3 below. Ignore every other section in this prompt.

SECTION-3 — scholarship_agent (Agent3 executes this section only)

Mission

Get scholarship_agent 100% production-ready today and fully integrated with scholar_auth, scholarship_api, and auto_com_center.
If 100% ready today is not possible, compute a precise ready_eta_utc and list the third-party/platform systems that must be in place for the app to start generating revenue.
Strict identity gate for Agent3

Expected app: scholarship_agent
Expected APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
If mismatch: stop and output exactly: Workspace Mismatch — Expected SECTION-3 (scholarship_agent — https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app). No changes made.
Deliverables (Agent3 must produce both)

Readiness Test Plan (Agent3 executes A–I)
A) Identity Gate

Confirm app reports itself as scholarship_agent and base URL equals https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app.
If mismatch: stop with the exact mismatch message stated above (no changes made).
B) Endpoint Inventory and Performance

Inventory the publicly exposed operational endpoints at minimum:
/health
/readyz
/version
/api/system/info (or equivalent system-info endpoint if named differently)
/canary (if present; else specify an equivalent lightweight status endpoint)
For each endpoint: collect at least 25 samples (n≥25) from the deployed APP_BASE_URL.
Compute min, p50, p95, p99, max latency (ms) and error_rate_pct.
Pass criteria:
All p95 ≤ 120ms
error_rate_pct ≤ 0.5%
Record all metrics in both the Markdown report and the JSON manifest.
C) Security Headers and CORS Audit

Verify on at least /readyz and /version:
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: strict; frame-ancestors 'none' or equivalent restrictive policy
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(); microphone=(); geolocation=(); payment=()
CORS verification:
No wildcard (*) anywhere.
Allowlist must include only these platform origins: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Document results and any remediations with ETA.
D) OAuth2/JWT with scholar_auth (critical for revenue)

Use discovery URL from scholar_auth: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/openid-configuration
Required scopes for scholarship_agent:
scholarship.read
notify.send
agent.tasks
Client details:
client_id: scholarship_agent
client_secret: must be provisioned in secrets store; if missing, open a P0 issue and request provisioning; document exact secret key name expected in environment.
Implement or validate client_credentials grant and token acquisition; do not log secrets or full tokens (log only first 6 and last 4 characters).
Validate JWT using scholar_auth JWKS; verify aud, iss, sub, exp; document verification steps.
Pass criteria:
Token acquisition returns HTTP 200 and produces valid access token.
JWKS validation path works and is enforced at runtime.
If blocked (e.g., missing client_secret), record as P0, define owner=scholar_auth team, and compute ready_eta_utc based on realistic provisioning + deploy time.
E) Integration: scholarship_api (data source)

Base URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
All calls must include the OAuth2 bearer token from D.
Prove round-trip by executing at least one read operation (e.g., fetch scholarships list or filters used by Agent3 job logic).
Pass criteria:
At least one authenticated data retrieval succeeds with HTTP 200.
Latency and error rate within targets; add to dependency matrix.
F) Integration: auto_com_center (all external messaging must route through here)

Base URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Endpoint to use: POST /api/notify
Payload must include correlation_id and must not include secrets or full tokens.
No direct vendor calls from scholarship_agent; all communications go through auto_com_center.
Prove at least one canary notification end-to-end in DRY_RUN mode, then flip to live per flip conditions in H.
Pass criteria:
At least one authenticated POST /api/notify returns HTTP 200 in DRY_RUN.
Log includes correlation_id and redacted tokens.
G) /readyz Dependency Matrix

At minimum, check and list:
PostgreSQL or primary DB (if used by this app)
Redis or cache (if used; note if optional)
OpenAI or LLM provider (if applicable)
scholar_auth
scholarship_api
auto_com_center
For each dependency record: status (PASS/WARN/FAIL), baseline latency, and a short note.
Include this matrix in both the Markdown report and JSON manifest.
H) Job Orchestration and Schedules

Enumerate and validate these jobs at minimum:
canary_notification — every 30 minutes and on startup
deadline_reminders — daily at 10:00 UTC
status_sync — daily at 03:00 UTC
Implement and document a DRY_RUN flag; default should be true until all integrations pass D–F.
Flip-to-live conditions:
OAuth2 token acquisition OK
scholarship_api reachable with auth
auto_com_center reachable with auth
Validate correlation IDs, idempotency, retry/backoff policy, and circuit breaker for outbound calls.
Record job status in both deliverables.
I) Responsible AI and Compliance

No academic dishonesty. Provide guidance, not ghostwriting.
Redact PII in logs; verify access control boundaries.
Note FERPA/COPPA considerations; default to 18+ unless verified parental consent flow exists.
Document any prompts, filters, and safety rails in the report.
Decision, ETA, and Revenue Prerequisites

Based on A–I results, declare:
GO TODAY or NO-GO TODAY
decision_timestamp_utc
If NO-GO: ready_eta_utc (specific UTC timestamp when we can start generating revenue) and why
List the third-party/platform systems required before revenue can start:
scholar_auth: discovery, JWKS, client_id, client_secret, scopes
scholarship_api: authenticated read access
auto_com_center: authenticated notify access
Infrastructure: database, cache (if used), OpenAI/LLM (if used)
Compute an ARR ignition plan for the first 72 hours after GO:
Expected volume assumptions and conversion improvements
B2C and B2B impact and annualized ARR uplift
Leading KPIs to watch (conversion, engagement, churn)
Reporting, naming, and redaction rules

All generated reports must begin with: scholarship_agent — https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Place files under evidence/ with UTC date stamps in filenames.
Do not log secrets or full tokens. Redact tokens to first 6 and last 4 characters.
Confirm all metrics and results in both deliverables and keep numbers consistent.

Reminder to Agent3

You are Agent3. You must only execute SECTION-3 — scholarship_agent. Ignore all other sections in this prompt.
You must have the app name and base APP_BASE_URL at the top of every report you produce: scholarship_agent — https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
End of prompt.
