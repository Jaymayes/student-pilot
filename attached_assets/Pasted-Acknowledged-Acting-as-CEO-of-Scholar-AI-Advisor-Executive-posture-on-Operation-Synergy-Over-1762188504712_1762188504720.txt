Acknowledged. Acting as CEO of Scholar AI Advisor.

Executive posture on Operation Synergy

Overall: Conditional GO at T+390, pending two gating signals.
Gating signals required:
Auth GREEN: One successful student_pilot auth round-trip using the production issuer (fallback “student-pilot-temp” at T+45 if needed).
Comms Infra GREEN: “GREEN – Canary Stable” posted by T+255 with metrics: heap headroom ≥30%, DLQ growth = 0, error rate ≤0.1%.
Current status by pillar (based on DRI updates)

scholar_auth: GREEN. T+15 deliverables complete; client config drift exists in student_pilot (5 OIDC secrets) and provider_register (issuer updated). Standing by to support E2E.
scholarship_api: GREEN & FROZEN. P95 ~119.5ms; RBAC, standardized errors verified. No blockers.
scholarship_sage: GREEN & FROZEN. P95 ~1ms; security and RBAC verified. No blockers.
scholarship_agent: GREEN & FROZEN. No actions until T+270; ready to emit events during auto_com_center DRY-RUN.
auto_page_maker: GREEN & FROZEN. 2,101 pages live; SEO hygiene validated. No blockers. 2027 refresh budget earmarked.
student_pilot (Frontend DRI): READY pending Auth GREEN; will run 30-sample E2E in T+30–T+150 window and submit evidence bundle.
provider_register (Frontend DRI): READY for T+150–T+270 E2E; issuer set to production; RBAC isolation tests staged.
auto_com_center: STANDING BY. DRY-RUN approved to start immediately after Comms Infra “GREEN – Canary Stable,” allowlisted recipients only, no production exposure.
CEO decisions and directives

Go/No-Go criteria for platform (must all pass):
Platform P95 for top user flows ≤120ms.
Auth success rate ≥98% (student_pilot).
auto_com_center DRY-RUN delivery ≥99%, DLQ growth = 0, opt-out latency <5s, error rate ≤0.1%.
Standardized JSON errors with request_id across services.
Freeze discipline reaffirmed: Only secrets, issuer URLs, autoscaling/GC, monitoring/observability, and incident playbook content may change pre-Go. Any code/schema/API change requires CEO approval and resets freeze.
Capital allocation: Maintain $40–60k reserved for auto_page_maker refresh in 2027 to protect low-CAC engine.
Blocking items and owners

Comms Infra GREEN signal (heap pressure fix, autoscaling/GC tuning, 10-minute soak, metrics post)
Owner: Comms Infra Team
Deadline: T+255
student_pilot OIDC secrets (5) loaded and auth round-trip
Owner: Frontend DRI (student_pilot)
Deadline: T+45 fallback (temp client) or earlier with permanent client
Reporting cadence

All DRIs: 30-minute status cadence with Blocker/Owner/ETA/Risk-to-T+390.
Evidence bundles must include HAR files, screenshots where applicable, latency P50/P95/P99, standardized error examples with request_id, and SHA256 manifest.
Next checkpoints I expect

T+45: If needed, issue and rotate temp client for student_pilot; confirm first successful auth round-trip.
T+150: student_pilot submits 30-sample E2E evidence bundle.
T+255: Comms Infra posts “GREEN – Canary Stable.”
T+270–T+390: auto_com_center DRY-RUN executes with scholarship_agent event volume; evidence bundle submitted.
T+390: CEO Go/No-Go decision.
Action for you
If you want me to submit the Section 7 readiness report as Agent3, specify which application I am assigned by providing the APP_BASE_URL. I will then produce the Section 7 report in the mandatory format using the data you’ve provided and clearly mark any items as “per DRI evidence” versus “independently verified.”
