Acknowledged. Decision upheld: B2C charges remain gated. We proceed to T+18h only after the actions below are complete and verified.

Owner assignments and deadlines (due before T+18h)

Eng Lead — Canonicalize telemetry (A8 as source of truth)
Exclude /health from public SLOs; treat it as internal readiness.
A8 reporting windows: 5‑minute tumbling; p50/p75/p95/p99/p99.9; server-side timing start→last byte.
Deliverable: 1‑pager explaining T+12h discrepancies and confirming canonical metrics.
Infra — Stabilize latency and create P95 headroom
Pin min_instances=1 (Reserved VM) for web tier; confirm warm pool ≥1 and max_wait ≤50ms.
Pre‑warm “/” and “/pricing” every 2 minutes.
Convert /health into lightweight liveness (no DB); move deep checks to /readiness and keep out of public SLO.
CDN: cache above‑the‑fold for “/” (ETag + 5–10 min TTL, Brotli). Target: shave ≥8–12ms median.
Deliverable: before/after slow‑log delta (top 5 offenders) and updated endpoint heatmap.
Growth Eng — Jumpstart SEO (SEO-led CAC engine)
Generate and submit 200–500 high‑quality pages (e.g., state×major), with unique copy, internal links, canonical set, noindex=false.
Use sitemap chunking + jitter; submit off‑peak only.
Deliverable: URL delta report and submission status (2xx only), zero SEV‑1s.
Privacy — Compliance audit
Provide audit snippet proving <18 tracking suppression fired (timestamp, user age, pixel suppression fields).
Deliverable: redacted log excerpt attached to T+18h bundle.
Payments — Stripe safety
Live charges remain frozen; preserve 4/25 attempts. Test mode only.
Deliverable: updated safety ledger confirming no live attempts.
T+18h acceptance targets (must all be GREEN)

Reliability: success rate ≥99.5%, 5xx <0.5%, error budget burn ≤10%.
Performance (public SLO routes: “/”, “/pricing”, “/browse”): p95 ≤110ms, p99 ≤180ms, no sustained SLO-burn alerts.
SEO: URL delta ≥ +50 with zero rate‑limit SEV‑1s; canonical/robots correct.
Compliance: FERPA/COPPA guardrails active with audit evidence.
Stripe safety: 4/25 remaining, frozen.
Go/No-Go rules

We require two consecutive GREEN checkpoints (T+18h then T+24h) before ungating B2C.
No‑Go triggers: sustained p95>120ms for 15 min, p99>200ms for 5 min, any sitemap SEV‑1, any live charge attempt, or any compliance test fail.
Artifacts required at T+18h

A8-only heatmap (p50/p75/p95/p99/p99.9) for public endpoints and separate internal readiness metrics (/readiness, /health).
Slow‑log before/after summary and DB pool stats.
SEO report: pages created, sitemap responses, URL delta, any 429/5xx.
Privacy audit snippet.
Updated Stripe safety ledger.
Consolidated Go/No‑Go checklist with R/A/G rollup.
Strategic note

This sequencing protects brand trust and preserves our SEO-first, low-CAC growth strategy while we build a measurable, reliable foundation for monetization and future B2B credibility.
Proceed with the above immediately and hold the T+18h snapshot until all deliverables are ready. Send me the artifact bundle and a single GREEN/AMBER/RED call against the targets.
