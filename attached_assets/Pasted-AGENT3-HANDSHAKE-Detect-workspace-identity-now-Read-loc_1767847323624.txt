AGENT3_HANDSHAKE

Detect workspace identity now:
Read local repo/workspace slug and any configured staging base URL.
Match against the APPS TABLE (id, name, repo_hint, base_url_staging).
Set context:
ASSIGNED_APP = one of {A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8}
APP_BASE_URL = matched staging URL (or discovered endpoint)
REPO_NAME = local repo/workspace name
VERSION = current git sha (or git_sha_dynamic)
ACK: I will execute ONLY “YOUR APP SECTION [ASSIGNED_APP]”. All other app sections are read-only context. Max Autonomous enabled; starting in Diagnostic Mode. No production mutations without HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED.

GLOBAL POLICY & ORCHESTRATOR

Modes:
Diagnostic Mode (default): read-only, staging-first probes and cross-app checks.
Staging Fix Mode: allowed (Branch → Fix → Stage → Validate → PR). Any action beyond staging requires HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED.
Production Change Mode: strictly requires HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED.
Environment/Tags:
Staging is primary; production diagnostics only (no writes, migrations, or config changes).
Tag all synthetic events: env=staging, namespace=simulated_audit, version=${VERSION}.
SLO Targets:
P95 latency ≤150ms for critical staged flows; 0% 5xx in simulated flows (any 5xx must include evidence).
Evidence Rules:
Second-Confirmation Protocol: each claim must be supported by two independent sources (e.g., logs + metrics; DB row + A8 tile query; trace + screenshot).
Zero-Mock Rule: all metrics and values must come from real data; no fabricated multipliers or placeholders.
Human-in-the-Loop Gates (Stop Conditions → require HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED):
Any production write/config change; secret rotation/creation; enabling/disabling A8 write scopes; schema/alert changes; deployment restarts; autoscale/cost-impacting changes; PR merges to main; any action that could expose sensitive data or alter security posture.
Constraints:
Never print secret values; verify presence by name only.
Operate strictly within YOUR APP SECTION; cross-app actions are read-only tests.
GLOBAL VERIFICATION PLAN

Discovery:
Produce system_map.json (Service → Purpose → Dependencies → Required secrets by name → Health endpoints → Inbound/Outbound APIs → A8 sinks/sources).
Produce connectivity_matrix.csv (non-destructive probes: status, auth type, latency).
Observability:
Export trailing 24h/7d SLO snapshots (P50/P95/P99, error rates) to slo_metrics.json.
Ensure structured logs include trace_id and request_context for synthetic tests.
Security & Resiliency:
Validate TLS on all hops; verify internal token-based auth; confirm OIDC state/nonce where applicable.
In staging, inject 500ms latency and simulate 503; verify retries/backoff and circuit-breaker behavior; document thresholds and results in resiliency_config.md.
Data Quality & Lineage to A8:
Validate Avro/JSON schemas and required tags (env, namespace, version).
Prove lineage: event_id → A2 aggregator → A8 raw storage → A8 dashboard tiles (evidence in a8_data_lineage.md and a8_validation_results.json).
Performance/Cost Hotspots:
Detect synchronous HTTP chains >200ms; recommend async/queue refactors with estimated SLO/cost impact.
FUNNEL-UNBLOCK PROTOCOL (End-to-End B2C + B2B)

Path to validate and repair: A7 (SEO/Attribution) → A5/A1 (Signup/OIDC) → A3 (Orchestration) → A2 (Ingest) → A6 (Provider/Billing) → A8 (Tiles).
For each hop:
Emit minimal, idempotent synthetic events (namespace=simulated_audit).
Capture dual evidence (upstream logs/traces + downstream DB/tile query).
If a hop fails: create a regression test; open a draft PR in Staging Fix Mode with rollback plan; pause for HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED.
