Comprehensive Game Plan: Ship a Business, Not Just Code (A1–A8)

North Star objective (12–18 months)

Prove the path to $10M ARR by validating both engines of growth:
B2C: credits/subscriptions (A5/A4) with low-CAC pSEO (A7) and lifecycle marketing (A3)
B2B: provider marketplace fees (A6/A2) with Stripe Connect and live listings
Operating guardrails: 99.9% uptime; p95 ≤200 ms (≤150 ms for A1 discovery/JWKS); zero PII leakage; Responsible AI posture
System status (from E2E test report)

Green: A1/A2/A8 infrastructure; A5 login currently green; A7 infrastructure (www→apex 301, HSTS, sitemap); telemetry ingestion
Yellow: A3 email channel not proven at scale; A5 historically saw 401 (watch)
Red (revenue readiness): A6 has no provider_connected/listing_created yet; A7 scholarship JSON-LD missing; A7 CTAs missing UTM → attribution blind
Strategy overview

Fix first, then flood: remove revenue blockers before scaling traffic
Prove both revenue paths with “first dollar” tests: one real B2C purchase; one B2B listing → award → 3% fee
Instrument everything: A8 dashboards for latency, funnel, revenue, attribution
Execution plan by horizon

Horizon 0 (next 7–10 days): Unblock revenue and instrument

Success criteria (all must be green)
A6: ≥1 provider_connected and ≥1 listing_created
A7: JSON-LD present on scholarship pages; CTAs include utm_source=auto_page_maker
A3: 1 low-volume send_attempt → delivered/open/click verified
B2C: 1 successful “Booster Pack” purchase; credits +50 visible; A8 payment_succeeded
A8: tiles show A1 config p95 ≤150 ms, A5 login p95 ≤200 ms p50 ≤120 ms (24h), lead_captured, provider_connected, listing_created, payment_succeeded
Horizon 1 (next 30 days): Scale traffic, prove conversion

SEO: 500 incremental pages generated; 100+ new indexed URLs; first 25 organic clicks in GSC to apex
B2C: First paid cohort with trial→paid conversion ≥3%; p95 latency sustained
B2B: ≥3 listings live; ≥1 award triggered; 3% fee calculation validated (test/sim)
Email: 2–3 nurture sequences running with <0.2% complaint, >90% delivered
Horizon 2 (next 60–90 days): Optimize unit economics at scale

SEO: 3–5k pages; measurable CTR uplift via rich results; category hub internal linking
B2C: ARPU ≥$8–10/mo; 7–9% trial→paid target with value-triggered nudges
B2B: Rolling provider onboarding with 10+ active listings; fee capture cadence
Ops: Incident MTTR <60 minutes; weekly E2E regression + load tests in CI; privacy drills executed

Cross-cutting initiatives

Marketing & lead generation

SEO (A7): JSON-LD + UTMs immediately; submit sitemap; inspect top pages in GSC; build internal linking hubs (states, majors)
Email (A3): Warm-up small cohort; measure delivered/open/click; evolve into 2–3-step nurture toward “Upload a transcript” or “Buy credits”
In-product nudges (A5/A4): “Try premium with 5 credits” and “Complete your profile to unlock matches” modals; checkout recovery banner already implemented
Revenue-driving motions

B2C
One controlled purchase test with Stripe (test/live as allowed)
Track payment_succeeded → credits ledger → credit usage in A8
Optional time-boxed offer (e.g., 50 credits for $20) after first value action for conversion measurement
B2B
Concierge calls for 3 providers; complete Connect; publish 1 listing; run a “Scholarship Spotlight” email to relevant students
Simulate/execute award; verify 3% fee calculation and logging (fee_captured)
E2E QA & performance plan (no code change, validation only)

Playwright “business journey” (manual or scripted)
A7→A5 signup + trial; A4 doc upload; A5 purchase; A6 login→Connect→listing; A3 lead form; screenshot+HAR evidence
k6 load tests (staged)
A5 /api/login; A2 search; A7 page fetch; thresholds: p95 ≤200 ms (A5), ≤120 ms (A2), <200 ms (A7); <1% errors
Security/compliance drills
Unauthorized access negative tests; right-to-delete for 1 test student; unsubscribe rate and suppression verified for email
KPIs & weekly operating cadence

Growth: GSC indexed URLs + clicks; A3 leads with UTM; A5 signups via SEO/referral
Conversion: trial→first value → paid; A4 usage per user
Revenue: B2C payments (count, ARPU), B2B provider_connected/listing_created/fee_captured
Reliability: p95 latencies; uptime; 5xx rate; alerts trend
Compliance: unsubscribe/complaints; right-to-delete SLA
Risks & mitigations

Email deliverability risk (A3): start with small cohorts; monitor complaints <0.2%; rotate content; enforce double opt-in if needed
SEO crawler variance (A7): ensure server-rendered JSON-LD; validate via Google Rich Results Test; submit sitemap and monitor Coverage
Provider inactivity (A6): escalate to live onboarding calls; provide quick-start listing template; in-app banner remains as fallback
Intermittent auth (A5): keep 24h watch on 401 spikes with A8 alert; pre-warm login and cache OIDC metadata
