CEO Decision Memorandum — Operation Synergy

Executive summary

FOC status: NOT READY. Path to GREEN within 72 hours is achievable with decisive action.
Primary blockers:
Centralized-auth deviations and leaked client secret(s).
student_pilot E2E blocked by auth client registration/rotation.
auto_com_center governance inconsistency and pending DRY-RUN.
Missing or conflicting Section 7 reports (auto_page_maker, scholarship_agent) and duplicate/contradictory reports (scholarship_sage).
Economic priority reminder: Auto Page Maker must be production-ready and event-driven from scholarship_api; it is our lowest-CAC growth engine. Its missing/partial readiness is a top-line risk.
Final decisions and mandates

One and only issuer
Decision: scholar_auth remains the sole OIDC issuer. No other service may advertise, proxy, or redirect OIDC discovery or token endpoints.
Mandate: Remove all OIDC endpoints from non-auth services and return 404 (no redirects, no “helpful” discovery). Token validation must use scholar_auth JWKS only.
Deadline: T+6h code merged and deployed; T+12h verified in E2E logs.
2. Secret leakage response (compromised secrets in chat/logs)

Decision: Treat every previously displayed client secret as compromised.
Mandate (Auth DRI):
Rotate student_pilot client secret again and any other client secrets mentioned or logged.
Invalidate all refresh tokens issued since the first exposure timestamp.
Enforce “no secrets in logs or chat.” Add log guard rails to strip secrets and authorization headers.
JWKS key-rotation schedule: rolling every 30 days, emergency rotation playbook documented.
Deadline: T+1h rotation complete; T+2h audit trail and verification bundle submitted.
3. student_pilot unblock and E2E

Decision: Proceed with E2E immediately after Auth DRI confirms registration + secret rotation via secure channel.
Acceptance criteria (30-sample run):
Auth success rate ≥ 98%
P95 end-to-end page-to-dashboard ≤ 120ms for API calls; zero critical 5xx
Lighthouse accessibility ≥ 90
Recommendations fetched from scholarship_sage primary path
Deadline: T+4h finish E2E and submit evidence bundle.
4. provider_register issuer configuration

Decision: Update provider_register AUTH_ISSUER_URL to the production scholar_auth immediately.
Mandate: Register client “provider-register” in scholar_auth; enforce Provider role isolation. Execute 30-sample RBAC isolation tests after student_pilot is GREEN.
Deadline: T+6h config + registration; T+12h RBAC test bundle.
5. auto_com_center governance and DRY-RUN

Decision: The canonical state is “no OIDC endpoints present”; comply with Decision #1.
DRY-RUN scope: Postmark (or equivalent) in sandbox mode only, queue, template rendering, bounce/complaint handling, and unsubscribe compliance.
Acceptance criteria:
Zero sends to live channels
Queue durability tests at 5x peak expected load; no message loss
Opt-out flow compliant and auditable
Deadline: T+6h DRY-RUN start; T+18h pass report.
6. scholarship_api stability freeze

Decision: ACCEPTED as READY pending ecosystem E2E. Maintain a freeze on schema/index changes during the E2E window.
SLO: Sustain ≤120ms P95; standardized error payloads.
7. scholarship_sage canonicalization

Decision: scholarship_sage is an Intelligence service. Use the production URL only. Remove any dev hostnames from config/docs.
Mandate: Submit a single canonical Section 7 report with the production APP_BASE_URL and versioned /recommendations contract v1 as the only source of truth.
Deadline: T+4h.
8. scholarship_agent report and eventing

Decision: Missing for FOC. Submit Section 7 for scholarship_agent covering M2M auth (SystemService), ingestion logic, retries/circuit breakers, and event emission to auto_com_center.
Acceptance criteria: Demonstrate resilient fetch/push with exponential backoff and circuit break; standardized event payloads.
Deadline: T+6h.
9. auto_page_maker FOC-critical

Decision: Missing. This is the engine for organic growth and must be GREEN before FOC.
Mandate: Submit Section 7 with:
Verified trigger from scholarship_api create/update
Template population correctness
SEO metadata (titles, descriptions, schema.org) and sitemap updates
Automated deployment to public endpoints
Evidence of 10+ pages generated and indexed-ready (noindex toggle off in prod)
Deadline: T+12h submission; T+24h DRY-RUN SEO checks completed.
10. Compliance and risk controls

FERPA/COPPA and CAN-SPAM/GDPR requirements must be verified in auto_com_center and across data flows.
Add Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) summary in each Section 7 where user data is processed.
Deadline: T+24h DPIA summaries attached to each report.
FOC gating checklist (must all be GREEN)

Centralized auth: scholar_auth only issuer; JWKS validation across all services; CORS restricted to student_pilot and provider_register.
Secrets: All compromised secrets rotated; refresh tokens invalidated; log guards active.
B2C E2E: student_pilot 30-sample pass with acceptance criteria met.
B2B E2E: provider_register 30-sample RBAC isolation pass; Provider-only data access verified.
Intelligence: scholarship_sage recommendations v1 consumed by student_pilot; response schema stable.
Automation: scholarship_agent M2M with retries/circuit breakers; events posted to auto_com_center.
Communications: auto_com_center DRY-RUN pass; queue durability and unsubscribe compliance verified.
SEO engine: auto_page_maker page generation + SEO metadata + deployment verified; sitemap updated.
SLOs: 99.9% uptime target; ≤120ms P95 for all public APIs sustained through E2E window.
Standardized errors: Consistent JSON with request_id everywhere.

Data-first reporting required

Submit a consolidated E2E dashboard by T+24h with:
P50/P95/P99 latency per service (24h window)
Error rates (4xx/5xx) and top 3 standardized error codes
Auth success funnel (authorize → token → app session)
Messaging DRY-RUN delivery metrics and queue depth
Auto Page Maker page counts, crawlability signals, and schema validation pass rate
Lifecycle and revenue cessation guardrails

Infrastructure (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center): Plan for 5–7 year refresh; budget a 2029–2031 modernization track. Monitor for OAuth standard shifts and PQC mandates.
User-facing (student_pilot, provider_register): Plan 3–4 year redesign cadence (2028 window) with incremental accessibility improvements quarterly.
Intelligence/Automation (scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker): Plan 2–3 year refresh (2027–2028), with continuous model/logic upgrades every quarter.
Go/No-Go posture

Current: NO-GO for FOC.
Target: GO within 72 hours, contingent on passing the gating checklist above.
Next executive checkpoint: T+24h with evidence bundles; T+72h final FOC review.
Notes on contradictions detected

scholarship_sage: Conflicting app type and multiple base URLs reported. Resolve to a single Intelligence service with the production URL only. Submit one canonical Section 7.
auto_com_center: Conflicting statements about OIDC endpoints. The final, authorized state is “no OIDC endpoints exposed.” Confirm in code and evidence.
Close
Execute with urgency. The $10M ARR trajectory depends on the B2C engine (Auto Page Maker + student_pilot) and the B2B engine (provider_register) coming online under centralized auth, with zero ambiguity. Report back at T+24h with the consolidated evidence dashboard and any exceptions requiring executive decision.
