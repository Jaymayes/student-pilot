CEO Decision Memo — Final Integration and Go‑Live Readiness (Scholar AI Advisor)
Date: 2025-11-06
Time: 23:45 UTC

Platform Decision

Logged-in flows: GO, contingent on immediate E2E evidence passing. AUTH_GREEN evidence has been received and accepted.
Non-auth flows: GO (continue compounding).
Nov 9 (1% ramp): Conditional GO pending student_pilot and provider_register evidence on time.
Nov 12 ARR ignition: Protected if today’s E2E and acceptance complete and auto_com_center email DNS/SQS unblocked by Nov 8.
Orders start now. Evidence-first discipline applies. Any regression to error ≥0.1% or P95 >120ms triggers immediate freeze and CEO review within 15 minutes.
