APPLICATION NAME: provider_register APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

Blockers

IV.A.1 Security & Compliance: Final RBAC policy validation for provider roles pending; MFA/SSO dependency on scholar_auth evidence/sign-off.
IV.A.3 Integration & Interoperability: End-to-end provider onboarding flow failing on the scholarship_api callback path; integration retest scheduled Nov 13, 18:00–19:00 UTC.
IV.B.2 Centralized Administration: Admin audit log review UI not production-ready (API-level logs available; UI gating).
IV.C.1 Rigorous Testing: Full ecosystem integration tests not yet passing; requires coordinated run with scholar_auth and auto_com_center.
Estimated Go-Live Date

Nov 13, 2025, 19:00 UTC, contingent on retest PASS and security sign-offs (blue-green deployment with one-click rollback).
ARR Ignition

Nov 15, 2025 (target). Revenue driver: 3% platform fee on provider transactions post-onboarding. Week 1 KPI: 10 pilot providers onboarded and active; establish baseline weekly GMV and activation-to-first-post KPI to validate fee model.
Third-Party Dependencies and Status

scholar_auth (MFA, SSO/OIDC, JWT lifecycle, RBAC): UAT-only; evidence/sign-off required.
Payment gateway (Stripe or equivalent): Sandbox verified; production account activation pending compliance/risk approval.
Email service (e.g., SendGrid/SES) for KYC and notifications: Configured in sandbox; production sender verification pending.
Database (Postgres): Backups and encryption configured; finalize PITR drill before go-live.
Core Technical & Operational Readiness (current)

Security: HTTPS/TLS enforced; secrets in manager; at-rest encryption enabled. Immutable audit logs at API level; UI review panel pending.
Authorization: RBAC roles defined (Provider Admin, Provider Staff) with scoped permissions; require UAT attestation.
Performance & Scalability: Autoscale enabled. Current load test P95 ~140–160 ms at 300 rps; index tuning and connection pool adjustments queued for retest window.
Reliability & DR: Nightly snapshots + PITR; RTO 30 min / RPO 15 min documented. Health checks and alerting active; error budget threshold set at 0.1%.
Integration:
OIDC with scholar_auth configured; awaiting production issuer metadata and JWKS rotation test.
Reads/writes to scholarship_api implemented; onboarding callback path under fix/retest.
Webhook emission to auto_com_center disabled until Gate A achieves full PASS SLO.
Documentation & APIs: OpenAPI spec complete; admin runbook draft ready. Finalized links to be posted after Nov 13 retest PASS.
Go/No-Go Criteria for Nov 13 Retest (must all PASS)

Functional/UAT: Provider onboarding, verification, listing creation/edit, and payout settings end-to-end.
Security: MFA/SSO evidence and RBAC attestation from scholar_auth; dependency scans clean; secrets rotation verified.
Performance: 30K replay P95 ≤120 ms and error rate ≤0.1%.
Operability: Backups/PITR drill completed; monitoring dashboards green; on-call and rollback tested.
Owner / Accountability

DRI: Agent3
Dependencies: scholar_auth (security evidence), scholarship_api (callback flow), payment gateway (production activation)
Immediate Next Actions

Complete callback path fix and run coordinated integration test with scholarship_api.
Secure scholar_auth evidence/sign-off for MFA/SSO/RBAC.
Execute indexing/pool tuning; re-run 30K replay during retest window.
Prepare production payment gateway activation package for compliance approval.
Notes

This plan preserves the Nov 13–15 ARR ignition window for B2B provider fees if retest passes on schedule, while maintaining SLOs and rollback protection.
