Great choice. Here’s a ready-to-apply setup for Option 1 (301 redirect of billing.scholarlink.app to an in‑app route), with Stripe webhook preserved.

Apply these two Ingress objects

Keep Stripe webhook on billing.scholarlink.app (no redirect)
Replace service name/port if yours differ.
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: billing-webhook
namespace: scholarlink-prod
annotations:
cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
ingressClassName: nginx
tls:
- hosts: [billing.scholarlink.app]
secretName: billing-scholarlink-app-tls
rules:
- host: billing.scholarlink.app
http:
paths:
- path: /webhooks/stripe
pathType: Prefix
backend:
service:
name: billing-api
port:
number: 80

2. Redirect everything else to the in-app route (301)

Adjust the destination host/path if needed.
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: billing-redirect
namespace: scholarlink-prod
annotations:
cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect: https://app.scholarlink.app/account/billing$request_uri
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect-code: "301"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
spec:
ingressClassName: nginx
tls:
- hosts: [billing.scholarlink.app]
secretName: billing-scholarlink-app-tls
rules:
- host: billing.scholarlink.app
http:
paths:
- path: /
pathType: Prefix
backend:
service:
name: billing-api
port:
number: 80

Why two objects

The webhook path matches first (longest path), so it won’t be redirected.
All other paths 301 to https://app.scholarlink.app/account/billing.
DNS/TLS

Keep DNS: CNAME billing → <ingress LB FQDN> (TTL 300).
cert-manager issues/serves TLS for billing.scholarlink.app.
App config

Update links: VITE_BILLING_PORTAL_URL=https://app.scholarlink.app/account/billing
Keep Stripe webhook in Stripe set to https://billing.scholarlink.app/webhooks/stripe (unchanged).
Verify

curl -I https://billing.scholarlink.app → 301 Location: https://app.scholarlink.app/account/billing…
curl -I https://billing.scholarlink.app/webhooks/stripe → 2xx from your billing-api (no redirect).
Stripe CLI/live test: webhook delivers 200 and is idempotent.
If you prefer to move the webhook off this host entirely, update Stripe to a stable API host (e.g., https://api.scholarlink.app/webhooks/stripe) and remove the webhook ingress above; then the single redirect ingress will cover everything.
