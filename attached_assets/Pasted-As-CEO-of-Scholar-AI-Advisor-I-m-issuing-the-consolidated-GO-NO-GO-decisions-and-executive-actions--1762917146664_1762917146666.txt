As CEO of Scholar AI Advisor, I’m issuing the consolidated GO/NO-GO decisions and executive actions to drive today’s go-live readiness toward our $10M profitable ARR plan. Decisions are based on the evidence and statuses provided. Final verification is required via the posted HTTPS evidence endpoints and standard QA sign-off.

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY
CEO Decision: GO
Rationale and directives:

Evidence endpoints live: /api/evidence, /evidence/{filename}, /openapi.json; manifest, checksums, and immutable caching implemented.
Satisfies SLO posture and API-as-product hygiene for internal orchestration and comms.
Action: Maintain 99.9% uptime and ≤120ms P95. Add rate-limit and abuse detection dashboards to scholarship_sage by EOD+1.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: PROVISIONAL GO (Live, frozen)
CEO Decision: GO; approve post-freeze deployment window
Rationale and directives:

SEO engine is our low-CAC growth flywheel; metrics reported green (CWV p75 green, ≥95% indexation, 100% uptime, ~100ms P95).
Evidence API and /openapi.json clarified for a public site.
Action: Proceed with automated paging rollout post-freeze on Nov 12–13. Guardrails: no CWV regressions; hold rollback plan to ≤5 minutes. Daily SEO-to-activation funnel reporting into scholarship_sage.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: ALL REQUIREMENTS COMPLETE (pending gates)
CEO Decision: CONDITIONAL GO for Nov 13, 16:00 UTC
Rationale and directives:

Evidence API live with checksums; P95 ~55.6ms, 0% errors; OpenAPI and /docs in place.
Conditions to lift: DSAR endpoints operational and tested; Gate C (scholar_auth P95 ≤120ms) passes.
Action: Post DSAR verification and auth gate pass, promote at 16:00 UTC Nov 13. Add WAF/DoS thresholds and per-tenant rate limits to evidence.
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED
CEO Decision: NO-GO until Gate C passes
Rationale and directives:

Central IdP; static evidence serving works, but /api/evidence and /docs returning 404 indicates routing/registration issue.
SSO/MFA/PKCE, RBAC, encryption posture documented; must be verified by live endpoints.
Action (timeboxed): Fix routing and activate API endpoints within 4 hours. Run end-to-end OIDC + session rotation tests with student_pilot and scholarship_api. Schedule Gate C at 20:00–20:15 UTC Nov 12 and post pass/fail evidence immediately. No downstream GA (provider_register) until Gate C passes.
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Waitlist; Conditional GO path)
CEO Decision: CONDITIONAL GO for limited beta upon proof of Gate B pass; NO-GO for GA until auth Gate C passes
Rationale and directives:

Evidence endpoints live (/api/evidence, /openapi.json). Gate B (payments/webhooks/3% platform fee) scheduled; require proof of deterministic fee calc, signature verification, refund flows, finance sign-off.
Action: Post Gate B pass evidence and finance sign-off. If clean, lift to limited beta (5–10 providers) Nov 14, 09:00 UTC; GA on Nov 15, 09:00 UTC only after scholar_auth Gate C pass. Add provider KYC/KYB evidence and transaction-level audit logs to evidence index.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Observer mode)
CEO Decision: GO (Observer mode)
Rationale and directives:

100% uptime, P95 ~16ms; cross-app KPI rollups live; evidence API routing fix reported “within 30 minutes”—confirm live now.
Action: Keep observer-only posture. Enable fairness telemetry Nov 13–14 with bias parity monitors and remediation playbooks. Publish the KPI dashboard links and daily rollups to the evidence index. Add CAC, activation, conversion, ARPU, and provider revenue tiles per Prime Directive.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: ALL ACTIONS COMPLETED (Observer mode)
CEO Decision: GO (Observer mode only); NO-GO for campaign sends until latency SLO met
Rationale and directives:

Evidence endpoints live; HOTL gates enforced; fairness telemetry operational. Reported P95 ~200ms exceeds 120ms SLO.
Action: Deliver a latency reduction plan to ≤120ms P95 within 48 hours (optimize prompts, caching, streaming, and concurrency). No autonomous sends until: latency SLO met, unsubscribe/CAN-SPAM/CASL/GDPR consent workflow verified, and deliverability warm-up plan posted to evidence.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: MISSING REPORT
CEO Decision: NO-GO pending Section V
Rationale and directives:

Critical student-facing app; no current Section V or evidence URLs in the submission.
Action: Submit Section V in required header format with HTTPS evidence endpoints today. Must include: MFA/SSO integration, RBAC, encryption, audit logging, offline-readiness assessment (if mobile), CWV targets, end-to-end integration with scholarship_api and scholar_auth, and UAT results. This app is gating B2C activation and revenue; prioritize.
Portfolio-level executive directives and KPIs

Security and compliance

Verify live audit trails, access logs, and DSAR endpoints for scholarship_api, scholar_auth, student_pilot. Add FERPA/COPPA statements and processor inventories to each app’s evidence.
Schedule third-party penetration test window and SOC 2 readiness checklist; attach scopes to evidence indexes.
SLOs and reliability

Enforce 99.9% uptime and ≤120ms P95 across all apps. scholarship_agent to publish the latency remediation plan within 48 hours. Post synthetic checks and error-budget burn charts to scholarship_sage.
Integration integrity

Require request_id lineage across user journeys: auto_page_maker → student_pilot → scholar_auth → scholarship_api → scholarship_sage, plus provider_register → scholarship_api. Publish an integration test report per flow in each app’s evidence.
Growth and ARR ignition

B2C funnel: auto_page_maker daily SEO rollups, student_pilot “First Document Upload” activation %, free→paid conversion %, and credits ARPU reported in scholarship_sage.
B2B funnel: provider_register active providers, MRR from 3% fee, payment success rate, refund rate, chargeback rate. Evidence of finance reconciliation and webhook determinism required before GA.
KPI targets for this phase:
Activation (student_pilot): ≥30%
Free→Paid conversion: 6–10%
Credits ARPU: $8–$12
Active providers (beta): 5–10 by Nov 15; 25+ by Nov 30
Provider GMV tracked and reconciled daily; 3% platform fee collected and verified
Responsible AI and ethics

scholarship_agent and auto_com_center: document consent, suppression lists, and opt-out mechanisms; publish fairness and selection-parity dashboards; no black-box decisioning. Attach model cards and prompt policies in evidence.
Deployment and rollback

Maintain freeze windows and blue/green or instant restore rollbacks with ≤5-minute MTTR for all apps. Confirm in each app’s evidence index with tested runbooks and timestamps.
Immediate CEO requests

Post live verification screenshots or logs for each app’s /api/evidence, /openapi.json, and a sample evidence file URL returning 200 OK. Bundle links in each app’s evidence index.
scholar_auth: Fix routing and complete Gate C tonight 20:00–20:15 UTC; post PASS/FAIL with logs.
provider_register: Post Gate B results and finance sign-off; request LIMITED BETA approval once posted.
student_pilot: Deliver full Section V and evidence endpoints today; this is a blocker for full ARR ignition.
Prime Directive alignment

Data-first and low-CAC growth: auto_page_maker remains the top priority to protect the SEO flywheel driving the B2C and B2B funnels.
Student value as the economic driver: student_pilot readiness is non-negotiable; prioritize activation experience and speed-to-value.
Lean, autonomous ops with clear gates: agents stay within single-app scope; evidence endpoints are the source of truth; decisions are made on verifiable artifacts.
I will issue final full-GO portfolio authorization once student_pilot Section V is delivered, scholar_auth passes Gate C, scholarship_api DSAR endpoints are verified, and provider_register posts Gate B pass with finance sign-off. Maintain execution velocity and evidence discipline.
