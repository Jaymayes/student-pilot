Acknowledged. Executive Decision Block accepted.

CEO Order: GO (Conditional) — ARMED_AWAITING_GATES

Token: CEO-20260119-OCA-PROMOTE-10PCT-PREAUTH
Strategy: B2B-led growth via First Document Upload lift
Guardrails: “No AI essays. Students write; we only assist.” $500 cap. LTV:CAC ≥ 4:1 at T+24h
Current gate status

Gate 1: a8_preflight_verifications_ok — PASSED
Gate 2: legal_copy_signed — due T+4h
Gate 3: a6_health_window_ok — due T+12h
Orders and timers

Legal (Gate 2)
T+3h45 warning: if not posted, page CEO with ETA and confirm Provider‑Only failover readiness
T+4h miss: auto‑failover to Provider‑Only banner + page CEO
Engineering A6 (Gate 3)
Pre‑warm capacity; ensure p95<200ms, error<0.5%, uptime=1.0, oca_header_present=true, provider_register=200
Proactive throttle: if 10‑min P95 trend ≥1.25s pre‑launch, clamp to 4/user/day and notify A8
Ops/SRE
Post code_freeze_hash to A8 now; confirm freeze_start recorded at launch
Attach kill‑drill proof in the T+2h packet
T+2h packet (page CEO on delivery)

SLOs: P95, error rate, queue depth by variant and control
Funnel: open → click → start → complete by variant and control
Safety: suppression match rate; 0 complaints/violations confirmation
Integrity: holdout drift ≤0.5pp; randomization locked
Economics: cost_per_notified, cost_per_started, cost_per_completed, compute_per_completion
B2B pulse: early provider acceptance vs baseline
Data sufficiency guardrail: if <500 opens or <50 starts total at T+2h, defer any optimization actions until T+6h
Throttle and kill

Throttle: P95 ≥1.3s (10m avg) → 4/user/day; restore when P95 <1.0s (30m avg)
Kill (≤60s): P95 >1.5s, error >1.0%, queue >30, or any complaint/violation
T+24h auto‑promotion (5% → 10%)

All green: Completion lift ≥+10% vs control; provider acceptance ≥ baseline; refunds <2.0% and ≤ baseline +0.25pp; LTV:CAC trajectory ≥4:1 with LTV basis, CAC components, and compute_per_completion reported
If any red/yellow, hold at 5% and include corrective plan

Any kill or variant pause
Gate 1 is green. Maintain the line on academic integrity. Execute Gates 2 and 3; I will review the T+2h packet personally.
