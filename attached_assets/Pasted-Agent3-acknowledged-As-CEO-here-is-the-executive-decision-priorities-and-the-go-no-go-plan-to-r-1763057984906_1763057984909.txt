Agent3, acknowledged. As CEO, here is the executive decision, priorities, and the go/no-go plan to recover schedule, protect security, and hit ARR ignition with confidence.

Executive decisions

Foundation first: Proceed with Path A. Scholar_auth is the critical path; all services depend on it. You are authorized to pause downstream work until service-to-service auth and RBAC are correct and verified.
Correctness over speed: Take the 2 hours to fix the execution packet completely before distribution. No teams start on Gate 0 until your corrected packet is issued.
Feature freeze: Effective immediately, freeze all net-new features across the 8 apps. Only security, integration, defect fixes, and test coverage are allowed until go-live.
De-scope offline mode: Offline mode for student_pilot is out of scope for this release. Reassess for Q1 2026.
Traffic control: Auto Page Maker can continue SEO content and capture leads, but product CTAs must route to a waitlist until Gate 2 passes. No paid acquisition until Gate 2 is green.
Budget approval: Approved to provision Reserved VM/Autoscale for scholar_auth and scholarship_api to meet availability and P95 latency targets. Proceed.
48-hour recovery plan and gates
Gate 0 – Foundations (deadline: Nov 14, 10:00 MST)

Health endpoints: All 8 services must expose /health with dependency checks (DB, outbound providers, and auth reachability).
Configuration: Zero hardcoded URLs. All services must use environment variables; boot-time fail-fast on missing env.
CORS lockdown: Explicit allowlist to student_pilot and provider_register only. Deny-by-default policy.
Auth packet: Finalize and distribute the corrected Env/Auth Standards packet (RS256/JWKS, client credentials, RBAC claims). Exit criteria: 100% services pass /health with dependencies; config audits clean; CORS allowlist in place; Auth packet distributed.
Gate 1 – Security and reliability (deadline: Nov 15, 18:00 MST)

scholar_auth: OAuth2 client-credentials grant, RS256 tokens with kid and JWKS; issuer/audience claims; roles and fine-grained permissions in token; token TTL 5 minutes; rotation guidance (90-day key rotation with overlapping validity and JWKS caching).
JWT validation stability: scholarship_api fixes middleware to select key by kid, cache JWKS with backoff, verify iss/aud/exp/nbf, and load test at expected peak QPS.
MFA verification: Complete integration tests with external provider; document fallback if provider degrades.
Monitoring: Centralized logs for auth decisions, 401/403 rates, and circuit-breakers; alerts on token validation failures >0.1% for 5 minutes. Exit criteria: Auth S2S flow demonstrably works across scholarship_api, scholarship_agent, scholarship_sage (positive and negative tests); P0 security issues = 0.
Gate 2 – E2E workflows (deadline: Nov 17, 12:00 MST)

Student journey: Register → Login (MFA) → Profile → Recommendations → Apply → Confirmation. Must succeed 10/10 runs in CI against production-like staging.
Provider journey: Register → Create Scholarship → View Applicants → Update Status. Must succeed 10/10 runs.
Notifications: Status change in scholarship_api triggers auto_com_center; emails/SMS render correct env-driven URLs and unsubscribe links; bounce/drop monitoring wired. Exit criteria: E2E pass rate 100% in staging, then 2 successful runs in production shadow mode; no P0/P1 defects open.
Gate 3 – Performance and HA (deadline: Nov 18, 18:00 MST)

SLOs: 99.9% uptime target; P95 <120ms for lightweight reads; P95 <250ms for write/compute flows. Confirm Reserved VM/Autoscale settings.
Load tests: auth and API at projected 3x week-1 load. Error rate <0.5%, no Hot Path timeouts. Exit criteria: Meets SLOs under load with headroom. Runbook and scaling policies documented.
Gate 4 – UAT and content readiness (deadline: Nov 19, 15:00 MST)

UAT signoff: Student and provider flows approved by product/ops; legal/privacy checks complete; FERPA/COPPA posture reviewed; secrets validated in platform vault; audit logs present. Exit criteria: Go/No-Go board convenes at Nov 19, 17:00 MST.
Critical path directives by application
scholar_auth (owner: Auth DRI; you coordinate)

Implement OAuth2 client credentials with RS256; publish /.well-known/openid-configuration and JWKS; enforce iss/aud/scope.
RBAC: Include roles and permissions claims for student, provider, admin, service accounts. Deny-by-default authorization across consumers until scopes are present.
CORS allowlist: Only student_pilot and provider_register.
MFA: Complete provider integration tests; document fallback.
Health: /health checks DB, SMTP/MFA provider, JWKS signer state.
HA: Reserve VM/Autoscaling configured. Deadline: Gate 0/1.
scholarship_api (owner: API DRI)

Fix JWT middleware stability; verify kid selection; cache JWKS with backoff and expiry; enforce iss/aud/scope.
Business rules/data integrity: Harden validation for submissions; reject inconsistent states; add idempotency keys for writes.
Notifications: Implement trigger to auto_com_center on status changes.
Health: Include DB, auth, auto_com_center reachability; HA config finalized. Deadline: Gate 1; notifications by Gate 2.
student_pilot (owner: Frontend DRI)

Configuration: Replace all hardcoded URLs with env vars; centralized ConfigManager; boot fail-fast.
Resilience: Graceful error states for auth/API outages; user-friendly messages and retries.
De-scope offline mode for this release. Deadline: Gate 0 for config; Gate 2 for UX resilience.
provider_register (owner: Provider DRI)

P0: Resolve /health 500 within 4 hours. If not root-caused, roll back to last known good.
Configuration and resilience parity with student_pilot.
RBAC alignment: Enforce provider-only actions via permissions claims. Deadline: Health hotfix today; Gate 0/2 parity.
scholarship_sage (owner: Sage DRI)

Blocked until S2S auth. Then validate recommendation quality on production-like data; define acceptance metrics (Top-10 precision >=70%, diversity guardrails, cold-start behavior).
Performance test under anticipated concurrent reads. Deadline: Gate 2 functional, Gate 3 performance.
scholarship_agent (owner: Agent DRI)

S2S auth for scheduled tasks; implement monitoring dashboard and alerting for task success/failure; complete audit logging.
Integration tests with auto_com_center queues. Deadline: Gate 1 auth; Gate 2 integration.
auto_com_center (owner: You as DRI)

Status: Gate 0 URL refactor complete per your note; proceed to load testing and bounce/drop monitoring integration.
Keys and secrets: Confirm all in platform secrets; rotate test keys.
SLA: Establish retry, DLQ, and alert thresholds for delivery failures. Deadline: Gate 1 monitoring; Gate 2 full workflow.
auto_page_maker (owner: SEO DRI)

Continue publishing SEO pages; CTAs to waitlist until Gate 2 passes.
Track indexation and CTR; ensure no broken links to app flows. Deadline: Ongoing; daily report.
Evidence, tests, and KPIs

Single source of truth: Your War Room board is the only status authority. Every claim must be backed by machine-generated evidence: curl outputs, latency snapshots, commit SHA, build ID, and timestamps.
Security acceptance tests:
Positive S2S: scholarship_agent obtains client-credentials token and writes to scholarship_api → 200; audit log entry created.
Negative S2S: wrong audience → 403; missing scope → 403; expired token → 401; unlisted origin CORS → blocked.
E2E tests: Student and Provider journeys must pass 10/10 runs in staging CI; 2/2 in production shadow. Notifications show correct env-driven links.
SLO dashboards: Report P95 latency, error rates, and uptime per service. Thresholds: token validation failure rate <0.1% 5-minute window; API error rate <0.5% under 3x expected load.
Compliance and risk

Secrets: All third-party API keys in platform vault; no plaintext in code or docs.
PII protection: Encrypt sensitive fields at rest; verify role-scoped access; ensure audit logs cannot leak PII.
Responsible AI: Scholarship_sage recommendations must be explainable; log rationale metadata for top recommendations; no automated essay generation that could promote academic dishonesty.
Cadence and communications

War Room stand-up hourly during Gate 0; then every 2 hours through Gate 2.
CEO snapshots: 09:30 and 16:30 MST daily with green/yellow/red per gate and a three-bullet risk list.
Go/No-Go: Nov 19, 17:00 MST. ARR ignition remains Nov 20 only if Gate 4 is green; if not, automatic slip to Nov 25 with a soft-beta and waitlist CTA.
Immediate next actions (you, Agent3)

Deliver the corrected Env/Auth Standards packet within 2 hours, then unblock DRIs.
Auth DRI: Begin OAuth2 client credentials + JWKS finalization; coordinate with API DRI for validation tests. CORS lockdown today.
Provider DRI: Hotfix /health 500 within 4 hours or roll back.
You as DRI for auto_com_center: Complete load test and monitoring wiring; publish evidence pack.
Replace any conflicting status notes with machine evidence on the War Room board. No conflicting, anecdotal statuses allowed.
Authority confirmation

You retain Integration Lead authority for gates, standards enforcement, and go/no-go recommendations. Escalate P0 blockers immediately. You are authorized to halt any deployment that violates Gate criteria.
Report back at 12:00 MST with:

Auth packet delivered confirmation and link
scholar_auth S2S token issuance and a successful API call evidence (request/response redacted)
provider_register health status resolution
auto_com_center load test baseline and alert configuration summary
Let’s execute with precision and close the gaps to hit ARR ignition with quality and security intact.
