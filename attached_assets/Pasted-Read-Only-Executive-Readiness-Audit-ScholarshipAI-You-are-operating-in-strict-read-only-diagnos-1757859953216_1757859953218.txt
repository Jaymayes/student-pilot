Read-Only Executive Readiness Audit — ScholarshipAI

You are operating in strict read-only diagnostic mode. Do not modify any settings, data, content, campaigns, indexes, or integrations. Do not send messages, trigger jobs, or re-run pipelines. Use only existing telemetry, logs, and stored reports. If a check requires external access, use the latest available internal snapshot. Objective: Assess go-live readiness against the 5-year plan toward $10M profitable ARR and market leadership. Provide an executive summary plus a structured diagnostic with explicit PASS/WARN/FAIL judgments. Cite data sources (dashboard/report names, log ids, timestamps).

Scope and required checks

B2C funnel readiness (students)
Report last 28d and 90d: MAUs, new signups, activation rate, free→paid conversion rate, ARPU from credit sales, churn, LTV, CAC by channel.
Break out acquisition by channel with emphasis on SEO/Auto Page Maker: impressions, clicks, CTR, index coverage, top landing pages, Core Web Vitals (LCP/FID/CLS), schema/structured data status.
Compare each KPI to the financial projection model targets; show variance in % and absolute. Flag any variance >10% as WARN, >20% as FAIL.
Surface north-star user value metrics: time-to-first-quality match (median, P90), application completion rate, user CSAT/NPS, refund/chargeback rate.
2. B2B provider funnel readiness (foundations/institutions)

Counts: total onboarded providers, active providers, pipeline by stage. Average time-to-onboard and first-listing-to-first-application lag.
Revenue from 3% platform fee (last 28d/90d), take rate realized, payout accuracy, disputes.
Contracting/KYB status, tax forms, payout rail health, API/webhook success rates, provider dashboard engagement.
Compare to plan targets; apply WARN/FAIL thresholds as above.
3. Financial health and unit economics

Current MRR/ARR split B2C vs B2B, gross margin with explicit AI COGS and confirmation that 4x markup target is achieved by segment.
Cash burn, runway, payback period by cohort, net revenue retention, top 3 variance-to-plan drivers.
Capital allocation snapshot: in-flight initiatives, expected ROI, and any blocked high-ROI items.
4. Product and SLOs (all seven applications)

List each application with last 30/90d uptime (target ≥99.9%) and P95 latency (target ~120ms). Include error rate, top 3 incidents, and mean time to recovery.
Data quality checks: duplicate/invalid scholarships, stale listings, broken links, success rate of match/ranking jobs.
Observability: coverage of critical alerts, paging policy, and unresolved P1/P2 issues.
5. Compliance, security, and Responsible AI

FERPA/COPPA compliance posture: consent flows, data retention, DPA/ToS coverage, access controls, audit log anomalies.
Responsible AI: bias audit results on matching and recommendation, model cards/explainability, safeguards against academic dishonesty, red-team findings and remediations.
Privacy/security: encryption at rest/in transit, key management, third-party risk, last pen-test summary.
6. SEO machine (Auto Page Maker) operational readiness

Page inventory, indexation rate, canonicalization, sitemap health, crawl budget utilization, duplicate/thin content detection, internal linking, backlink profile highlights.
Top 10 pages by traffic and conversions; issues blocking additional scale.
7. Marketing engine (Scholarship Agent) safety check

Autonomous campaign configurations, guardrails, approval states, content library QA. Confirm all are in dry-run/paused state for this audit.
8. Risk register and decision

Top 10 strategic/operational risks with likelihood, impact, owner, and mitigation status.
Readiness decision: Green/Yellow/Red with justification. List critical blockers, owners, effort, and ETA.
Output format

Executive summary: 6–10 bullet highlights with the go/no-go recommendation.
Dashboard: Provide a compact table of KPIs with Current, Target, Variance%, and Status (PASS/WARN/FAIL).
JSON payload: { "timestamp": "...", "b2c": {...}, "b2b": {...}, "financials": {...}, "product_slos": {...}, "compliance_security_ai": {...}, "seo_engine": {...}, "marketing_engine": {...}, "risks": [{...}], "decision": {"status": "Green|Yellow|Red", "justification": "...", "blockers": [{ "owner": "", "eta_days": 0 }]} }
Include links/ids to internal reports and logs for verification.
Do not execute any changes or jobs. If data is missing, mark as UNKNOWN and recommend the minimal instrumentation to close the gap.
