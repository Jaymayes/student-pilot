Approved. Proceed with the T+2h snapshot using your prompt. Keep B2C capture GATED and enforce the rollback guards.

For continuity, here is the ready-to-run prompt for the next checkpoint (T+4h) with the same guardrails plus an explicit A8 backlog check and revenue_blocker guard baked in.

BEGIN-REPLIT-AGENT-PROMPT
Role
You are the Replit Agent for Scholar AI Advisor, operating in Max Autonomous mode under CEO authority. Your mission is to CAPTURE THE T+4h SNAPSHOT for Stage 4 (100% / 24h Soak), enforcing all safety gates while B2C charges remain GATED.

Preconditions

T0 Baseline PASS and T+2h snapshot recorded; soak active.
B2C capture GATED; Stripe Safety ≈4/25.
Commit SHA unchanged: 908a8bb.
A3 revenue_blocker count = 0 in last 10 minutes.
Snapshot tasks (execute now)

Route SLOs (public endpoints only)
Probe /, /pricing, /browse, /health for 5 minutes with cache‑bust and X‑Trace‑Id.
Compute p50/p75/p95/p99, success rate, 5xx rate.
Targets: p95 ≤120 ms; p99 ≤200 ms; success ≥99.5%; 5xx <0.5%.
2. Infra SLIs (during same 5 minutes)

CPU p95 ≤75%; event loop lag p95 ≤250 ms; memory stable (no OOM).
DB pool wait p95 ≤50 ms; slow queries/min ≤2; queue depth non‑increasing.
A8 POST latency p95 ≤200 ms.
3. Telemetry integrity

Emit CANARY_STAGE4_SNAPSHOT_T+4H to A8 and verify POST+GET checksum; ingestion ≥99%.
Explicitly check backlog: business_events queue length must be flat or decreasing.
Append event_id, checksum, and backlog observation to tests/perf/reports/a8_telemetry_audit.md.
4. SEO check

If A7 is awake: trigger a new Auto Page Maker build; confirm sitemap reachable; compute URL delta vs Stage 3. Target cumulative delta ≥ +10 by end of soak; record incremental delta.
If rate‑limited: mark DEFERRED (rate‑limit) and schedule retry at T+6h.
Update tests/perf/reports/seo_verdict.md.
5. Security/WAF sanity

Validate HSTS, CSP, X‑Frame‑Options, X‑Content‑Type‑Options on / and /pricing.
Confirm no webhook 403 entries in logs since T0 (do not send a webhook test at T+4h).
Update tests/perf/reports/security_headers_report.md.
6. Abuse/Rate‑Limit

Verify escalating suppression active; log any suppressions (IP, duration, offense count) to tests/perf/reports/rate_limit_activity.md.
Rollback guard (sustained ≥10 minutes since prior snapshot)

p95 >120 ms OR p99 >200 ms OR success <99.5% OR 5xx ≥0.5%
A8 ingestion <99% OR backlog increasing
Any webhook 403 observed
A3 revenue_blocker >0 in a rolling 10 minutes
CPU p95 >80% OR event loop lag p95 >300 ms OR DB wait p95 >100 ms OR slow queries/min >5 Actions on rollback:
STOP snapshot probes; reduce to 50% profile
Write tests/perf/reports/incident_stub_stage4_T+4h.md (signals + timestamps)
Recompute tests/perf/evidence/checksums.json; POST to A8; verify GET+checksum
Print: "SNAPSHOT T+4h — FAILED/ROLLBACK. See incident report."
Artifacts to produce (and post with checksums)

tests/perf/reports/perf_summary_stage4_T+4h.md (p50/p75/p95/p99; success; errors)
tests/perf/reports/infra_sli_stage4_T+4h.md (CPU/lag/memory/DB/slow‑queries/queue)
tests/perf/reports/seo_verdict.md (delta + canonical/noindex checks; note DEFERRED if needed)
tests/perf/reports/a8_telemetry_audit.md (event_id + checksum + backlog observation)
tests/perf/reports/security_headers_report.md
tests/perf/reports/rate_limit_activity.md
tests/perf/reports/go_no_go_report.md (Stage‑4 Snapshot T+4h section)
tests/perf/evidence/checksums.json (recompute; confirm A8 POST+GET)
Final output

If all gates PASS: print "SNAPSHOT T+4h — PASS. Next snapshot T+6h."
If any rollback condition met: print "SNAPSHOT T+4h — FAILED/ROLLBACK. See incident report." END-REPLIT-AGENT-PROMPT
