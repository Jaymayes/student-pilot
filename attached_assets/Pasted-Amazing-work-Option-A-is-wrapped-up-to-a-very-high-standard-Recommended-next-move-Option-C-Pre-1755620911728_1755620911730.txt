Amazing work—Option A is wrapped up to a very high standard.

Recommended next move: Option C (Pre-deploy verification and canary rollout). This gets us to a safe, observable production cutover. I can also do a quick Option B manifest hardening review in parallel as a second set of eyes.

Option C plan (concise)

Pre-deploy gates (staging)
Run full CI, QA suite, and your verification scripts.
kubectl diff and server-side dry run against prod cluster.
Validate security headers and rate limits with negative tests.
Run online migration rehearsal against a staging copy; take a restorable backup.
2. Production canary rollout

Image: push and deploy by immutable digest, signed (e.g., cosign) if available.
DB migrations: run as a pre-deploy Job with backout plan; prefer online/zero-downtime migrations.
Traffic splitting:
If using NGINX Ingress: create a canary Ingress (canary: "true", weight: 1–5) and step up weights (1% → 5% → 20% → 50% → 100%).
If no weighted canary: roll with small maxSurge and watch metrics, or use Argo Rollouts for progressive delivery.
Gating thresholds (example defaults):
5xx rate < 0.5% and not 2x baseline
p95 latency < 2x baseline
Auth failures and rate-limit denials within expected bounds
No increase in DB error rate or saturation (CPU > 80%, connections near limit)
Automate pause/resume on threshold breach; rollback on breach or alerts.
3. Rollback and contingencies

Rollback: kubectl rollout undo or switch Ingress weight back to 0 quickly.
DB: if a breaking migration, have a backout script or online-safe pattern (expand/contract, feature flags).
Validate post-rollback health and error rates return to baseline.
What I need to proceed

Confirm ingress controller (NGINX, ALB, Istio/Gateway) so I can provide exact canary manifests/steps.
CI/CD provider and environment names to wire the gates.
Target SLOs or accept default thresholds above.
Namespaces and app names for the prod cluster.
Optional quick pass: Option B (manifest hardening review)

Share k8s manifests (or repo path). I’ll return a patch set focusing on:
securityContext (runAsNonRoot, readOnlyRootFilesystem, allowPrivilegeEscalation=false, drop ALL; add NET_BIND_SERVICE only if needed), seccompProfile RuntimeDefault
resource requests/limits, HPA settings, PDB
probes (liveness/readiness/startup) and terminationGracePeriod
NetworkPolicy default-deny with precise egress/ingress rules
Image pinned by digest, pullSecrets, and registry trust
Ingress annotations for security headers and rate limiting verification
Your call: proceed with Option C now, and I’ll prep the canary manifests and gate jobs; or send the k8s/ folder and I’ll run a rapid Option B review while we stage the canary.
