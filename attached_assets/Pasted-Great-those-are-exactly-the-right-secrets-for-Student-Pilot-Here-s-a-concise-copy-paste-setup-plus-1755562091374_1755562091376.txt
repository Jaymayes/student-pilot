Great—those are exactly the right secrets for Student Pilot. Here’s a concise, copy/paste setup plus quick verification and smoke tests.

What to set in Student Pilot (in Replit Secrets)

SHARED_SECRET: long random string (must match Command Center)
COMMAND_CENTER_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
AGENT_NAME: student_pilot
AGENT_ID: student-pilot
AGENT_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Optional: HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS=60000
Tip to generate a strong secret

Node: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"
Or: openssl rand -hex 48
What to set in Auto Com Center (Command Center)

SHARED_SECRET: same value as Student Pilot
AGENTS_ALLOWLIST: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
JWT_ISSUER=auto-com-center
JWT_AUDIENCE=scholar-sync-agents
Optional: ADMIN_AUDIENCE=scholar-sync-admins (if you gate dispatch)
After setting secrets

Restart both apps.
Within 60 seconds, Student Pilot should auto-register and heartbeat.
Quick verification

Agent capabilities: curl -s https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/agent/capabilities Expect capabilities: ["student_pilot.match_scholarships","student_pilot.analyze_essay"]
Command Center sees the agent: curl -s https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/orchestrator/agents Expect an entry for agent_id "student-pilot" with status online
Health: curl -s https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/health
End-to-end smoke tests

Match scholarships:
curl -s -X POST https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/orchestrator/tasks/dispatch 
-H "Content-Type: application/json" 
-d '{
"action":"student_pilot.match_scholarships",
"payload":{"student":{"gpa":3.7,"major":"Computer Science","level":"undergrad","country":"US"},"limit":10},
"requested_by":"qa",
"resources":{"timeout_ms":20000,"retry":1}
}'
Then poll:
curl -s https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/orchestrator/tasks/<task_id>
Expect: status=succeeded with matches[] and scores

Analyze essay:
curl -s -X POST https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/orchestrator/tasks/dispatch 
-H "Content-Type: application/json" 
-d '{
"action":"student_pilot.analyze_essay",
"payload":{"prompt":"Why is STEM important to you?","essay":"From an early age...","options":{"tone":"supportive","maxSuggestions":5}},
"requested_by":"qa",
"resources":{"timeout_ms":30000,"retry":1}
}'
Expect: status=succeeded with feedback { strengths, improvements, score }

Security check (optional)

Invalid JWT direct call should be rejected: curl -s -X POST https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/agent/task -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer not-a-valid-token" -d '{"task_id":"t1","action":"student_pilot.match_scholarships","payload":{"student":{"gpa":3.0}}}' Expect: 401/403
Events audit (optional)

curl -s https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/orchestrator/events Expect recent events from source student-pilot with types like scholarships_matched or essay_analyzed
Common pitfalls

“Agent routes disabled” persists: one of the required vars is missing or the app wasn’t restarted.
Not listed in Command Center: AGENTS_ALLOWLIST missing Student Pilot URL, or SHARED_SECRET mismatch.
Dispatch returns “no agent supports action”: capabilities not advertised; ensure /agent/capabilities includes the two actions and wait for the next heartbeat (or restart).
Secret rotation (recommended)

Add NEW_SHARED_SECRET, allow both for verification during a short window, restart both, then remove the old. Keep iss=auto-com-center and aud=scholar-sync-agents consistent.
If you want, I can generate a small Postman collection or bash script preconfigured for Student Pilot to run these tests in one click.
