Acknowledged. Gate 2 MISSED. Failover is now the authoritative state.

Decision: FAILOVER ACTIVATED
Status: DEGRADED — Provider-Only Mode
Clock: T+07:44 (Current 05:55Z; Gate 2 limit 02:11:13Z)

Immediate orders (execute and post A8 evidence)

Ops/SRE
Flip to Provider-Only mode (if not already). Post:
oca_failover_activated with lock_event_id, missed_deadline_ts
provider_only_banner_active = true (screenshot_id)
student_notifications_suppressed = true (queue_count=0, suppression_rule_hash)
Correct dashboards: status → Gate 2 Missed / Failover Active.
Purge or hard-hold any queued student emails/modals; confirm zero sends after 02:11:13Z.
Budget/SLO guardrails unchanged; maintain kill ≤60s and throttle policies.
General Counsel
Page CEO with RCA/ETA. Post legal_incident_created with doc_hash placeholder and remediation plan. No hot-fixing copy during freeze.
Engineering (A6)
Continue toward Gate 3 by 10:11:13Z (≈4h16m from current time). Provider-only canary still requires a6_health_window_ok.
Pre-warm capacity sized for provider-only traffic (~10% of original expectation). Keep proactive throttle on.
Launch condition (Provider-only)

Auto-launch on receipt of a6_health_window_ok. Emit oca_canary_started with mode = provider_only.
T+2h packet (Provider-only version; page CEO on delivery)

SLOs: P95, error, queue
Provider funnel: banner impressions → clicks → onboard start → verification task created → acceptance
Safety: 0 complaints/violations
Integrity: OCA header present; no PII in logs
Cost telemetry: cost_per_notified, cost_per_started, cost_per_completed (provider flow), compute_per_completion
Provider metrics: acceptance vs baseline, time-to-first-review, decline reasons (top 5)
Evidence: kill-drill proof attached; screenshots of provider banner; confirmation of student suppression (post-02:11Z)
T+24h decision (Provider-only)

No student promotion. Success measured on B2B:
Provider acceptance ≥ baseline
Incidents/complaints = 0
SLOs within thresholds; refunds/chargebacks = 0
Unit economics: compute_per_completion within margin; LTV:CAC trajectory ≥4:1 (provider-side)
Postmortem requirement (Legal miss)

GC to deliver 5-point brief: root cause, why detection failed before T+3h45, containment, corrective actions, new sign-off path with auto-reminders.
Reminder

Code Freeze remains absolute.
Integrity line stands: “No AI essays. Students write; we only assist.”
Eyes on Gate 3. Page me on a6_health_window_ok, any kill/complaint, or any deviation from Provider-Only mode.
