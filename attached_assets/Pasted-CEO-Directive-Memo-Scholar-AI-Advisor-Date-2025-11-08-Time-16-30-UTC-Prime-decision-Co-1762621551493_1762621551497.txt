CEO Directive Memo — Scholar AI Advisor
Date: 2025-11-08 | Time: ~16:30 UTC

Prime decision

Continue deep remediation on scholar_auth immediately, while keeping auto-slip communications fully staged. Gate rules remain unchanged. Quality bar is non-negotiable.

Status acknowledgement

JWKS P95 117ms: Green.
Discovery P95 ~200ms and wrong issuer: Red. Root cause appears to be a routing precedence conflict (catch‑all intercepting /.well-known/*), compounded by a suspected build/caching artifact.
Token/Authorize not yet revalidated under the new fast-path stack.
Executive decisions and deadlines (UTC)

16:50: Post “route precedence” proof: route table dump showing explicit handlers registered ahead of any catch‑all; include server start logs with mount order.
17:10: Clean-build and cold-start plan executed across all workers/pods. Artifacts required: build logs, image/tag IDs, and process list to rule out stale TypeScript transpilation.
17:30: Canary A/B results for all four endpoints on fast-path (≥5% traffic, 5 minutes). Success threshold: ≥30% P95 improvement versus baseline.
18:15: Discovery endpoint must be Green on both correctness (issuer, jwks_uri, endpoints, scopes) and performance (P95 ≤120ms) under canary. If not green by 18:15, execute Contingency A below without waiting for further approval.
18:45: Headroom target: P95 ≤110ms @ 500 rps for all four endpoints.
19:15: Pre-soak verification: ≥500 samples/endpoint, latency histograms, error rate ≤0.1%.
20:00: Soak test gate (non-negotiable): P95 ≤120ms and error ≤0.1% for all four endpoints, ≥1,000 samples each, sustained 10 minutes. Any miss → auto-slip to Nov 10.
Controls and guardrails

Security is paramount: No temporary changes that weaken token integrity, issuer correctness, or revocation semantics.
JWKS/Discovery must not touch the DB; verify via query logs and middleware timings.
Keep-Alive on; compression off for the four fast-path endpoints until after gate; event loop latency <10ms; CPU <70%.
Contingency A (if Discovery not green by 18:15 UTC)

Isolate /.well-known/* and /oidc/* into a pre-mounted “front-of-line” router with explicit paths that cannot be shadowed by any catch‑all. Require:
Correct issuer EXACTLY matching the public base URL used by all relying parties.
Static, signed Discovery responses are prohibited. Dynamic responses must come from the authoritative OIDC provider instance configured with the correct issuer and jwks_uri.
Cache headers: ETag + Cache-Control: public, max-age=300 for Discovery and JWKS only.
Evidence: route order proof, OIDC configuration snapshot (issuer, jwks_uri, authorization_endpoint, token_endpoint), and a downstream validation via oidc-client conformance script.
Resourcing and escalation

Assign an SRE peer for pair-review on routing/mount order and build pipeline. If the issue persists past 18:15 UTC, pull in the Architecture Lead to review issuer construction and reverse-proxy rewrites.
2. provider_register (Stripe hard gate)
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision and deadlines (UTC)

16:35: Immediate status ping. If ANY item is at risk, escalate now to CFO and open Stripe priority support. Up to $500 approved pending CFO confirmation.
18:00: Hard deadline for production readiness:
Live STRIPE_SECRET_KEY loaded (production).
Webhook registered and verified in Stripe Dashboard.
200 OK test event received in production mode.
Consequence: If missed, B2B remains blocked regardless of auth outcome.
Evidence required

Screenshot or export of Stripe Dashboard settings, webhook secret, event delivery logs, and server logs showing verified signature and 200 OK.
3. auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision

Proceed with “both messages staged” posture. Do not broadcast unless triggered by the 20:00 soak outcome.
Maintain SMS disabled. Ensure email deliverability safety:
DMARC/DKIM/SPF alignment confirmed and documented.
Seed-list inbox placement checks ready.
Unsubscribe and frequency caps verified.
4. auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Acknowledgement

2025-11-08 06:00 UTC KPI rollup delivered early (16:12 UTC). Good. Maintain daily 06:00 UTC cadence under change freeze.
Next-week KPI goals (organic engine)

Pages live: +10% week-over-week.
IndexNow success ≥95%.
CWV p75 green across all top templates.
Error rate ≤0.2%; P95 ≤120ms; uptime ≥99.9%.
5. student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision

Remain change-frozen. E2E harness executes T+30 after AUTH GREEN TAG. Prepare evidence package with full request_id lineage and mobile/desktop parity.
6. scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision

Remain change-frozen; monitor-only. Ensure token validation against scholar_auth issuer reflects the corrected Discovery metadata once fixed. Evidence harness ready.
7. scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision

Remain change-frozen; M2M evidence executes T+30 after AUTH GREEN TAG. No changes.
8. scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision

Observe-only through Nov 12. Continue daily fairness rollups at 12:00/12:15 UTC. No changes.
Revenue timing and gates (unchanged)

B2C earliest ignition: Nov 10 00:00 UTC, contingent on AUTH GREEN TAG.
B2B earliest ignition: Nov 9 01:30–03:00 UTC, contingent on Stripe by 18:00 UTC and auth soak pass at 20:00 UTC; else align to next green window post-auth.
If 20:00 soak fails: auto-slip to Nov 10 00:00–00:15 UTC gate. No exceptions.
Evidence schedule to CEO (UTC)

16:50: scholar_auth routing/build evidence snapshot.
17:30: Canary A/B results with per-middleware timing histogram and rollout decision.
18:15: Discovery endpoint Green-or-Contingency A execution proof.
19:15: Pre-soak verification package (≥500 samples/endpoint).
20:05: Soak outcome and go/auto-slip confirmation.
23:35: Final evidence review (if soak passed) for 00:00–00:15 gate.
Direct answer to Agent3’s question

Continue debugging now under the plan above and execute Contingency A automatically at 18:15 UTC if Discovery is not Green. Auto-slip communications remain staged. Gate rules stand.
Guard the gate.
