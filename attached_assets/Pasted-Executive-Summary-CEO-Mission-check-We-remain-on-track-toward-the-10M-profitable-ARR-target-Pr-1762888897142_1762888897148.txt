Executive Summary (CEO)
Mission check: We remain on-track toward the $10M profitable ARR target. Priority for the next 36 hours is to pass Gate A and Gate C without interrupting the student funnel, hold the SEO flywheel gains, and lock down cross-cutting compliance by the Nov 12–14 deadlines. Proceed exactly as ordered; escalate immediately for any SLA risk >15 minutes.

Cross-Cutting Deadlines and Ownership

Monitoring Runbooks (Nov 12, 12:00 UTC): All apps deliver paging policies, health checks, SLOs, and incident runbooks. Owners: Respective DRIs; scholarship_sage to aggregate SLO dashboards.

Business Events Schema (Nov 12, 12:00 UTC): scholarship_api, provider_register, auto_com_center finalize canonical events; scholarship_sage validates queryability.
Privacy/Regulations (Nov 14, 18:00 UTC): student_pilot, scholar_auth, scholarship_api finalize DSAR endpoints and documentation; scholarship_sage consolidates into CEO pack.
Data Retention Schedule (Nov 14, 20:00 UTC): Centralized document covering all 8 apps. Draft for CEO preview Nov 12, 22:00 UTC. Final due Nov 14, 20:00 UTC. Owner: Agent3 (see policy below).
Answer to your question: Yes—create the final CEO-required Data Retention Schedule now.

Authoritative Data Retention Policy (CEO-approved standards to implement)

Core principles:

Minimize data; retain only what drives student value and compliance.
Default to aggregated/anonymized where possible.
Enforce crypto-shredding and documented deletion paths; honor legal holds.
Retention by data class:

Authentication logs (IP, device, auth events): 30 days hot; 180 days warm; 365 days aggregated. IPs truncated after 7 days.
Application logs (non-PII): 14 days hot; 90 days warm; roll-up metrics 400 days (13 months) for YoY comparisons.
Business events (activation, deliverability, fee accrual, matches, conversions): 400 days (13 months).
Student profile PII: Until account deletion. DSAR timeline: acknowledge 7 days, fulfill within 30 days; backups purged via rotation within 35 days.
Uploaded documents and application drafts: Active use; purge 90 days after account deletion unless legal hold or explicit student request to delete earlier; provide “Delete now” control.
Provider data (offers, payouts, KYC): Offers retained while live; takedown within 7 days on request. Financial/KYC: 7 years (accounting/AML norms).
Scholarship catalog content (public facts): Indefinite with quarterly accuracy review; respect provider takedowns in 7 days.
Email deliverability telemetry (seed inbox artifacts, ESP logs): 90 days; aggregate metrics 400 days.
Fairness telemetry and model explanations: 365 days; violations and remediations 2 years.
Security incidents and audit evidence: 5 years.
Web analytics (cookie-less/aggregated wherever possible): Aggregated 25 months; no raw PII.
Children’s data (COPPA): Under 13 not permitted; if detected, purge within 24 hours and record incident.
Storage, encryption, and lifecycle:

At rest: Provider-managed encrypted Postgres (Neon) and object store with server-side encryption (AES-256). In transit: TLS 1.2+ (prefer 1.3) and HSTS.
Lifecycle policies: S3-compatible object store lifecycle to transition hot→warm→cold→delete; database cron jobs for row-level expiry; scheduled DSAR workflows with audit trails.
Backups: PITR 7 days; weekly full backups retained 4 weeks; monthly retained 12 months; RPO ≤15 minutes, RTO ≤30 minutes.
Deletion and DSAR:

Single control plane to orchestrate deletions across all apps within 30 days; propagate to backups via rotation and key revocation (crypto-shredding).
Legal hold override with auditable approvals.
Ownership and reviews:

DRI per app responsible for implementation; scholarship_sage maintains the central register.
Quarterly CEO review; emergency update on any regulatory change.
Deliverable instructions for Agent3

Produce “DATA_RETENTION_SCHEDULE_2025-11-14.md” with per-app sections, data-class matrices, lifecycle diagrams, and DSAR flow. Include the required header for each app section: APPLICATION NAME: [App] APP_BASE_URL: [URL]
Draft due Nov 12, 22:00 UTC for CEO preview. Final due Nov 14, 20:00 UTC.
Risk Register (top)

DKIM provisioning delay → Mitigation: 14:00 UTC pivot authority already granted; execute if not provisioned.
Gate A failure risk → Mitigation: Immediate in-app fallback; student funnel continues.
DSAR endpoints completion by Nov 13, 16:00 UTC → Mitigation: scholar_auth + student_pilot + scholarship_api joint DRI session today, 21:00–22:00 UTC to finalize access/export/delete APIs.
ARR Ignition Milestones

B2C credits revenue earliest Nov 13–15, contingent on Gate A+C+student_pilot GO. Maintain zero-CAC SEO growth via auto_page_maker freeze and CWV/indexation guardrails.
B2B 3% fees earliest Nov 14–15, contingent on Gate B+C and CEO FULL GO. Keep provider_register in waitlist until then.
Final CEO Orders

Proceed with all gates and evidence SLAs exactly as scheduled. No relaxation.
Student funnel must not pause under any circumstance.
Immediate escalation to me for any SLA risk >15 minutes with root cause, mitigation, revised ETA, and impact.
Confirm receipt and begin the Data Retention Schedule now. Draft is due Nov 12, 22:00 UTC; final Nov 14, 20:00 UTC.
