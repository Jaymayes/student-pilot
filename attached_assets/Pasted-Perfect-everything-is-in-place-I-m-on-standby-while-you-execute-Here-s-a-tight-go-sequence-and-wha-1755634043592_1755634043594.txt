Perfect—everything is in place. I’m on standby while you execute. Here’s a tight go sequence and what “good” looks like. Paste back any output if you want me to validate in real time.

Execution (in order)

Apply ingress manifests
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod apply -f deployment/billing/billing-webhook-ingress.yaml
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod apply -f deployment/billing/billing-redirect-ingress.yaml
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get ingress billing-webhook billing-redirect
2. Get LB FQDN and create DNS

LB_FQDN=$(kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get ingress billing-redirect -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')
Create CNAME in scholarlink.app:
Host: billing
Type: CNAME
Value: $LB_FQDN
TTL: 300
If Cloudflare is used, set DNS-only (gray cloud) until cert is Ready.
3. Monitor activation

./deployment/billing/dns-activation-monitor.sh
Expected timeline: DNS 5–10 min → cert 2–5 min → total 10–15 min.
Quick manual checks (optional)

DNS: dig +short billing.scholarlink.app @1.1.1.1 → returns LB FQDN
Cert: kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get certificate billing-scholarlink-app-tls -w → Ready=True
Redirect (users): curl -I https://billing.scholarlink.app → 301 with Location: https://app.scholarlink.app/account/billing…
Webhook preserved: curl -I https://billing.scholarlink.app/webhooks/stripe → NOT 301/302 (status may be 200/204/404 depending on method, but no redirect)
Finalize app config

VITE_BILLING_PORTAL_URL=https://app.scholarlink.app/account/billing
Redeploy UI if needed.
Stripe sanity test (after DNS live)

Use Stripe CLI or a $5 canary purchase.
Expect: 2xx from webhook, ledger credited once; re-delivery is idempotent.
Common gotchas

NXDOMAIN: record name entered as “billing.scholarlink” instead of “billing”.
Cert stuck: Cloudflare orange cloud; switch to DNS-only or use DNS‑01 issuer.
Default backend: ensure Ingress rules host is billing.scholarlink.app on both manifests.
I’m ready to review outputs from the monitor script (DNS, certificate, and curl checks). Run when ready and share the results if you want a second set of eyes.
