I have generated the standardized "Since Go-Live" operational reports for all 8 apps.

Executive Summary of Ecosystem Status:

Overall: The platform is technically operational (auth, data, AI, payments, SEO, telemetry), but revenue flow is currently minimal due to specific blockers in the user acquisition and activation funnels.

Key Revenue Blockers:

A3 (scholarship_agent): Zero emails sent (deliverability blocked) → Marketing funnel is dead.

A6 (provider_register): Zero providers activated (Stripe Connect stuck) → B2B revenue is zero.

A5 (student_pilot): Zero paid conversions (traffic pipeline empty) → B2C revenue is minimal ($105 test).

A7 (auto_page_maker): Search Console not connected → SEO performance is blind.

Data Integrity: Synthetic data has been purged across the fleet. Real production data is sparse but clean.

Telemetry: Centralized reporting to A8 is working for most apps, but some attribution links (A7→A5→A8) need wiring.

Detailed Reports Per App:

A1 scholar_auth: 🟢 Operational. Auth flow fixed. Needs M2M whitelist on A2/A8.

A2 scholarship_api: 🟢 Operational. Data sync fixed. Needs frontend integration for search analytics.

A3 scholarship_agent: 🟡 Degraded. Email infra ready but sending is blocked/unconfigured.

A4 scholarship_sage: 🟢 Operational. AI ready. Needs visible credits UI/paywall.

A5 student_pilot: 🟡 Operational but empty. Payments live. Needs traffic & trial credits.

A6 provider_register: 🟡 Stalled. Infra ready. Providers stuck at onboarding.

A7 auto_page_maker: 🟢 Operational. Scaling pages. Blind on SEO metrics (GSC).

A8 auto_com_center: 🟢 Operational. Dashboard live. Email deliverability showing 0%.

Recommended Immediate Actions:

Fix A3 Email: Configure SendGrid/Postmark to start marketing campaigns.

Unblock A6 Providers: Manual/automated outreach to the 3 stuck providers to finish Stripe setup.

Drive Traffic: Connect A7 SEO pages to A5 signups with attribution.

Visible Value: Add trial credits to A5/A4 to demonstrate value before paywall.
