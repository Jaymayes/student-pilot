Executive Review and Go/No‑Go Decisions (CEO)

Context and Prime Directive
Our path to $10M+ ARR requires disciplined, low‑CAC growth, airtight governance, and SLOs that build trust. The five‑year playbook emphasizes an SEO‑led funnel, accelerating B2B monetization, and strong operational controls; keep all decisions anchored to that plan and its Year‑2 targets (SOC 2, analytics, and MAU scale) to compound into leadership by Years 3–5 . Human‑over‑the‑loop governance and explainability remain non‑negotiable across autonomous components  .

CEO Decisions by Application

scholar_auth — Status: CONDITIONAL GO
Decision: Proceed to pre‑soak and Gate C with compensating controls active. Hard gate remains P95 ≤120 ms by Nov 12, 20:00 UTC. Maintain HOTL governance, full auditability, and request_id traceability; ensure explainability for access decisions where applicable . Admin MFA enforcement go‑live on Nov 15 is accepted; require TOTP/WebAuthn enrollment window to open immediately with staged enforcement plan.
Evidence required: Attach latency under load report, auth success/error distribution, and audit trail excerpts.

scholarship_api — Status: FULL GO (Frozen)
Decision: Affirmed. Keep freeze to Nov 12, 20:00 UTC. Daily 06:00 UTC KPI rollups, 100% request_id coverage, and immutable audit posture continue. Ensure unified API governance and documentation quality consistent with “API‑as‑a‑product” standards so agents and partners can integrate predictably at scale .
Evidence required: Current P95 latency, uptime, error rate, API docs link, and rate‑limit fallback plan post‑freeze.

auto_page_maker — Status: FULL GO (Frozen)
Decision: Affirmed. Continue 06:00 UTC KPI exports for scholarship_sage ingestion. This remains our lowest‑CAC growth engine; protect CWV and indexing to sustain the SEO flywheel and MAU targets outlined in the playbook .
Evidence required: Indexation rate, CWV p75, organic traffic, and conversions in latest rollup.

provider_register — Status: CONDITIONAL GO (Waitlist)
Decision: Maintain waitlist until three gates are GREEN. Stripe “PASS” confirmation is required before any charge flow. Preserve auditability and deterministic 3% fee calculations; no “black box” pricing .
Evidence required: Stripe production credential validation, end‑to‑end payment sandbox logs, and audit trail sample.

student_pilot — Status: HOLD
Decision: Production‑ready is noted. Launch decision is Nov 13, 16:00 UTC, contingent on Gate A (deliverability) and Gate C (auth P95). Keep “first document upload” activation telemetry front‑and‑center; this is a core lever for B2C conversion per playbook learnings .
Evidence required: UAT results, activation funnel telemetry, and rollback/refund runbook.

scholarship_agent — Status: CONDITIONAL GO (Observer/Frozen)
Decision: Observer mode only until student_pilot is live and email deliverability is GREEN. Continue daily fairness rollups with rationale coverage and selection‑parity monitoring; retain HITL/HOTL approval gates for any outbound actions  .
Evidence required: Fairness dashboard snapshot, incident thresholds, and override controls.

scholarship_sage — Status: CONDITIONAL GO (Observer/Frozen)
Decision: Continue ingesting Auto Page Maker KPI files. Finalize fairness integration spec by Nov 12, 22:00 UTC with explicit explainability, decision traceability, and parity metrics to meet our Responsible AI bar .
Evidence required: 5/6 metrics validation logs and the finalized spec for Nov 12.

auto_com_center — Status: CONDITIONAL GO (Comms Gated)
Decision: No outbound email until Gate A passes. Gate A criteria: verified SPF/DKIM/DMARC, domain warm‑up, inbox placement ≥80% on seed tests, complaint rate ≤0.1%, bounce ≤2%. If Gate A fails at Nov 11, 20:00 UTC, switch to in‑app notifications and retry Nov 12, 12:00 UTC.
Evidence required: Postmark/ESP verification screenshots, seed test results, suppression list hygiene.

Gate Schedule and Owner Actions

Gate B (Stripe PASS) — Nov 11, 18:00 UTC
Owner: provider_register + Finance
Deliverable (within 15 min): PASS/FAIL, impact, next actions.

Gate A (Deliverability GREEN) — Nov 11, 20:00–20:15 UTC
Owner: auto_com_center
Deliverable: PASS/FAIL summary, seed test evidence, contingency status.

Gate C (Auth P95 ≤120 ms) — Nov 12, 20:00–20:15 UTC
Owner: scholar_auth
Deliverable: Load test results, error/failure modes, and SLO headroom.

student_pilot GO/NO‑GO — Nov 13, 16:00 UTC
Owner: student_pilot DRI
Deliverable: Final GO package with activation KPIs, credit purchase flow proof, rollback plan.

Security, Reliability, and Compliance Directives

Security posture: Maintain RBAC, PKCE, TLS 1.3/HSTS, no‑PII logs, and continuous auditability. HOTL gates must be provable (approvals, overrides, alerts) per our autonomy governance framework .
Availability and performance: 99.9% uptime, P95 ≤120 ms across user‑critical paths, with integrated observability. Continue reserved VM and monitoring practices aligned to production readiness guidance; keep clear separation of environments, secrets hygiene, and rollback workflows .
Responsible AI: Enforce fairness metrics, decision traceability, and user‑visible rationale where relevant; integrate periodic audits and redress mechanisms as we scale agentic functions .
SOC 2 trajectory: Confirm Year‑2 SOC 2 plan milestones are reflected in the evidence bundles and workback schedule, in line with the Playbook .
Evidence and Reporting Requirements

Central index: Provide a single “Executive Root Index” link with one‑click access to each app’s Section V status report, test results, API docs, uptime dashboards, and audit trail samples. The index must clearly show each app’s APPLICATION NAME and APP_BASE_URL per Section V.
Daily KPI: Deliver 06:00 UTC rollups starting Nov 11 for all live/frozen apps; scholarship_agent fairness rollup at 12:00 UTC. Use consistent templates so scholarship_sage can assemble cross‑app summaries.
Gate summaries: Submit within 15 minutes of each gate deadline (B, A, C) with PASS/FAIL, quantified impact, and next actions.
ARR Ignition and Risk

B2C credits: Earliest revenue Nov 13–15, contingent on Gate A + C; keep friction low around the “first document upload” activation step to maximize conversion in line with the roadmap emphasis on activation levers .
B2B 3% fee: Earliest revenue Nov 14–15, contingent on Gate A + B + C. Keep provider communications gated to protect sender reputation and brand trust.
Key risks to watch: Email deliverability readiness (primary), admin MFA enforcement timing (secondary), rate‑limiting fallback (post‑freeze remediation). Ensure disciplined post‑freeze backlog execution and change control.
CEO Closing
Stay on schedule. Protect the SEO flywheel to keep CAC near zero. Maintain SLOs and auditability. Our plan and governance standards—autonomy with HOTL, explainability, and strong API discipline—are the foundation for durable leadership and the $10M+ ARR trajectory   .

Action for Agent3 now

Share the live “Executive Root Index” link with per‑app Section V reports and evidence.
Confirm owners and timings for Gate B, A, and C deliverables.
Acknowledge this CEO decision set and flag any blockers immediately.
