Acknowledged. Executive Decision Block accepted.

CEO Order: GO (Conditional)

Authorization: CEO-20260119-OCA-PROMOTE-10PCT-PREAUTH
Strategy: B2B-led growth; “Editor/Coach” to secure First Document Upload and feed high-intent applicants to partners
Guardrail: “No AI essays. Students write; we only assist.” Non‑negotiable across all surfaces
Launch gates and automation

Auto-GO only when BOTH are posted to A8:
legal_copy_signed (GC_7721, SHA256, repo_path, commit_sha, signed_at)
a6_health_window_ok (p95<200ms, error<0.5%, uptime=1.0, provider_register_status=200, oca_header_present=true)
If Legal misses T+4h: auto-failover to Provider‑Only banner; page CEO with ETA and risk
SLOs, budget, and kill logic

Budget cap: $500
SLO thresholds: P95 ≤1.5s; error <1.0%; queue ≤30; refunds <2.0% and ≤ baseline +0.25pp; complaints = 0; violations = 0
Kill within 60s on breach; rollback + incident filed to A8 with proof
Measurement and controls

Core Activation Metric: First Document Upload
Control: 10% holdout (no notifications)
Cost telemetry: cost_per_notified, cost_per_started, cost_per_completed, compute_per_completion
Throttle policy: if P95 ≥1.3s for 10 min → 4/user/day; restore when P95 <1.0s for 30 min
Owner actions (time-bound)

Ops/SRE (Immediate)
Run 1‑minute kill drill; attach proof to A8
Verify compliance line renders identically in student/provider variants
Confirm schema flags live: holdout_control=true + all cost fields
General Counsel (T+4h)
Post legal_copy_signed; if delayed, trigger Provider‑Only banner and page CEO
Engineering A6 (T+12h)
Post a6_health_window_ok; pre‑warm capacity
Marketing (Immediate)
Enforce suppression for under_13 and no_consent; verify UTM/A8 attribution
Reporting packets (must page CEO on delivery)

T+2h: SLO by variant, queue depth, funnel by variant + control (open→click→start→complete), suppression match rate, 0 complaints/violations confirmation, cost telemetry
T+6h: Trends vs T+2h, refunds/chargebacks, provider acceptance vs baseline, top failure signatures, interim A/B + control lift
T+24h: Full readout + evidence pack (5 seed validations: OCA header, banner, Report Issue, audit entry, A8 IDs), ROI view (ARPU lift, payback, unit economics vs $500 cap)
Promotion rules

5% → 10%: Auto-promote at T+24h if all green using the token
10% → 25%: Prepare T+36h brief; require P95 ≤1.2s (last 6h), error <0.7%, completion lift ≥+12% vs control, provider acceptance ≥ baseline, and cost-per-completion within target margin
Variant quality safeguards

If provider acceptance dips below baseline for any variant, immediately pause that variant and notify CEO with a rapid QA plan
What pages me

oca_canary_started event, any gate miss, any provider complaint, any kill trigger
The configuration is locked. Guardrails are set. Execute.
