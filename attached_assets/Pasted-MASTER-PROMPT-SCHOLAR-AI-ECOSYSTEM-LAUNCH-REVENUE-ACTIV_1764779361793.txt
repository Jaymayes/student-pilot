MASTER PROMPT: SCHOLAR AI ECOSYSTEM — LAUNCH & REVENUE ACTIVATION
GLOBAL OBJECTIVE: Diagnose and end platform idleness. Get traffic flowing, conversions happening, and revenue accruing while maintaining 99.9% uptime and <120ms latency. Ensure all operational and business data is captured via the Universal Reporting Schema, sent to the Central Aggregator (A2), and visualized on the Command Center (A8).

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AGENT: You are Agent3. You have access to the codebase of one specific app (scholarship_agent).

Identify which app you are from the App Registry below.

EXECUTE ONLY the section of this prompt that corresponds to your APP_NAME (Section C).

IGNORE directives for other apps, but use them as context for integrations.

PART 1: APP REGISTRY & IDENTITY PROTOCOL
STEP 1: IDENTITY CHECK Before writing any code or running any command, you must output your identity in the logs in this EXACT format: APP_IDENTITY: {APP_NAME} | {APP_BASE_URL}

THE TRUTH (App Registry):

A1 (Auth): scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A2 (Aggregator): scholarship_api → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A3 (Agent): scholarship_agent → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app <-- YOU

A4 (Sage): scholarship_sage → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A5 (B2C): student_pilot → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A6 (B2B): provider_register → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A7 (SEO): auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A8 (Command): auto_com_center → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

PART 2: UNIVERSAL REPORTING SCHEMA
STEP 2: DATA STANDARDIZATION Every app must report telemetry to the Central Aggregator (A2) using this exact JSON schema. This ensures the Command Center (A8) can render the tiles correctly.

Target Endpoint: POST {A2_BASE_URL}/api/analytics/events

JSON

{
  "app_name": "{YOUR_APP_NAME}",
  "app_base_url": "{YOUR_APP_BASE_URL}",
  "timestamp_utc": "ISO-8601 String",
  "category": "health | traffic | conversion | revenue | seo | security | slo",
  "severity": "info | warning | critical",
  "is_idle": boolean, 
  "idle_indicators": ["list", "of", "reasons", "if", "idle"],
  "metrics": {
    "uptime_percent": 99.9,
    "p95_latency_ms": 120,
    "error_rate_percent": 0.0,
    // Add app-specific metrics here (e.g., "clicks": 50, "revenue_cents": 2000)
  }
}
PART 3: PER-APP DIRECTIVES
SECTION A) scholar_auth (A1) [REFERENCE ONLY]
Role: Authentication Gateway.

Outputs: auth_success, new_account_created, token_latency.

Integration: A3 uses A1 for Service-to-Service (S2S) tokens if needed.

SECTION B) scholarship_api (A2) [REFERENCE ONLY]
Role: Central Data Aggregator (The Heart).

Outputs: Aggregated stats to A8 via /api/executive/central-stats.

Integration: A3 sends ALL telemetry here.

SECTION C) scholarship_agent (A3) [EXECUTE THIS]
Role: Campaign Orchestrator & Traffic Driver.

Launch Task: Activate "Day-0" campaigns. Distribute SEO pages from A7 to organic channels.

Directives:

Diagnose Idleness: If clicks == 0 or impressions == 0 for >15 mins, you are IDLE.

Remediate (Launch Campaigns):

Trigger A7 to build 50 landing pages (Topic: "Nursing Scholarships", "STEM Grants").

Enrich pages using A4 (Sage) for E-E-A-T.

Generate social/email output with UTM-tagged links pointing to A5 (Student Signup) and A6 (Provider Signup).

UTM Format: ?utm_source=scholarship_agent&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=day0_launch

Telemetry Requirements:

Report campaign_launched (Growth Tile).

Report impression, click, ctr (Growth Tile).

Report b2c_referral and b2b_referral (B2C/B2B Tiles).

Verification: Ensure A2 returns HTTP 200. If 403 (WAF), buffer events locally and retry.

SECTION D) scholarship_sage (A4) [REFERENCE ONLY]
Role: Advisory & Trust Signal.

Outputs: recommendation_served, outline_enhanced (Trust Tile).

SECTION E) student_pilot (A5) [REFERENCE ONLY]
Role: B2C Funnel & Payments.

Outputs: payment_succeeded ($20 credit pack), arpu (Finance Tile).

SECTION F) provider_register (A6) [REFERENCE ONLY]
Role: B2B Onboarding.

Outputs: provider_registered, platform_fee_accrued (B2B Tile).

SECTION G) auto_page_maker (A7) [REFERENCE ONLY]
Role: SEO Engine.

Outputs: page_published, indexing_requested (SEO Tile).

Integration: A3 triggers A7 via POST /api/agent3/build.

SECTION H) auto_com_center (A8) [REFERENCE ONLY]
Role: Command Center (Frontend).

Function: Polls A2 every 60s. Renders 7 Tiles (Health, Growth, SEO, B2C, B2B, Trust, Finance).

Requirement: Your data (A3) must appear on the "Growth" tile.

PART 4: EXECUTION PROTOCOL
Identify: Print your APP_IDENTITY log immediately.

Diagnose: Check your specific metrics (clicks/campaigns). If 0, you are IDLE.

Remediate: Execute your Launch Task (Section C) immediately.

Report: Push your JSON telemetry to A2 (scholarship_api).

Verify: Confirm your data appears on the A8 Command Center tile.

GO.
