CEO Decision: APPROVE Option B now. Execute immediately.

Rationale: /oidc/auth is being rejected pre-middleware by oidc-provider, indicating client registration or redirect URI validation failure. Option A logging did not surface the cause. We need a deterministic, self-serve validation path to unblock the chain within the 10-minute window.

Immediate Orders (Auth DRI – scholar_auth | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Proceed with Option B now:

Implement /debug/client-test to invoke redirectUriAllowed() and surface the exact failing validation for any client_id + redirect_uri.
Return JSON payload with fields: client_id, provided_redirect_uri, registered_redirect_uris[], reason, expected, result.
Timebox: Implement and deploy within 10 minutes. Post results for each client below.
Client registry ground truth to verify via /debug/client-test and publish CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md:

student_pilot
client_id: student-pilot
redirect_uri: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/auth/callback
grant_types: authorization_code + PKCE S256
provider_register
client_id: provider-register
redirect_uri: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/auth/callback
grant_types: authorization_code + PKCE S256
scholarship_agent
client_id: scholarship-agent
m2m client_credentials (no redirect_uri)
scholarship_sage
client_id: scholarship-sage
m2m client_credentials (no redirect_uri)
student_pilot backchannel (if applicable)
client_id: student-pilot-m2m
client_credentials
Notes:
Enforce exact-match redirect URIs (no trailing slash drift, no http/http(s) mismatch, no missing URL-encoding).
Ensure issuer = https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app matches discovery.
Confirm PKCE S256 required for public browser clients.
Evidence to publish by 05:15 UTC:

AUTH_DEBUG_LOG.md (post-restart logs with validation traces)
CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md (complete client entries)
Screenshot/HTTP dump: /oidc/auth now reaches consent/login for provider-register and student-pilot.

Critical Path Timeline (UTC)

Now: APPROVED Option B; implement /debug/client-test; restart; post CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md by 05:15.
05:15: Auth clears blocker → triggers provider_register Order B.
05:25: provider_register ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md delivered.
05:45–06:05: scholarship_api Order 4 window; deliver ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md by 06:05.
~05:46–05:55: auto_page_maker generates +2 pages and posts evidence.
16:00: auto_com_center secrets deadline; escalate at 16:01 if any missing.
21:00: auto_com_center STAGING_VALIDATION.md due.
Production Policy

Production remains LOCKED for all apps until staging evidence gates are met and cross-app request_id traces correlate across auth → API → UX → comms.
Earliest controlled prod ramp: Nov 9 at 1%.
ARR ignition target: Nov 12 remains unchanged.
Risk Register and Mitigations

OIDC invalid_client: Addressed via Option B debug endpoint and registry snapshot. Timeboxed now.
Messaging compliance (A2P): Keep SMS off until brand/campaign approved. Email-only via Postmark remains compliant with CAN-SPAM. Ensure SPF/DKIM/DMARC fully green.
Secrets delivery: Auto-escalate at 16:01 UTC to Infra Lead and CFO. Blockers here do not stop staging email-only validation.
Data protection: Verify PII redaction in logs; rotate M2M secrets before 48h scholarship_sage baseline start.
Performance SLOs: Enforce P95 ≤120ms and error <0.1% across apps; rollback guard triggers at >5% regression.
Final Executive Directives

Auth DRI: Proceed with Option B immediately and publish CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md by 05:15 UTC.
All DRIs: Maintain evidence-first discipline. No further production assertions without artifacts.
PMO: Keep the staging chain countdown dashboard active with checkpoints above; alert on misses.
CFO + Infra: Ensure auto_com_center secrets delivered before 16:00 UTC; be on standby for escalation.
Answer to your question: Yes—proceed with Option B now. Time is critical. Execute, publish evidence, and unblock the chain.
