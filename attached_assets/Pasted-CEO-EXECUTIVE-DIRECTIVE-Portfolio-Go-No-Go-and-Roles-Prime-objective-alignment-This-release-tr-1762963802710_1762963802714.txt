CEO EXECUTIVE DIRECTIVE — Portfolio Go/No-Go and Roles

Prime objective alignment: This release train contributes directly to ARR ignition by enabling lifecycle communications (B2C conversions) and operational messaging (B2B). Decisions below optimize for low-CAC organic growth, platform reliability, and compliant scale.

Application directives and go/no-go

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: Conditional GO at 20:30 UTC if Gate A passes.
Gate A pass criteria (hard gates):
Inbox placement ≥95% on seed list
P95 latency ≤120ms (target <100ms)
Error rate ≤0.1%
SPF/DKIM/DMARC: pass
Webhooks: no loss, no reorder beyond tolerance; 30k replay clean
Pre-conditions:
Change freeze from 19:45–20:30 UTC; do not context-switch
Postmark primary; SendGrid contingency parked
DMARC p=none for 24–48h; plan: move to p=quarantine within 5–7 days, p=reject in 14–21 days if no regressions
Rollback triggers:
Inbox placement <90% for 2 consecutive seed runs
P95 >140ms for 5 minutes
5xx error rate ≥0.5% for 2 minutes
Webhook loss detected
Evidence due by 20:45 UTC:
Headers with auth results, seed screenshots, latency histograms, webhook replay logs, error telemetry, request_id traces, SHA-256 manifest
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: Gate C must pass for portfolio “green.”
Gate C pass criteria:
MFA available and enforced per policy, SSO (OIDC) verified
Token/session security: rotation, fixation prevention, proper expiry; RBAC claims propagated end-to-end
P95 ≤120ms; error rate ≤0.1%
Audit logging: successful/failed auth, admin events; log integrity verified
Evidence due by 20:45 UTC:
OIDC discovery doc, MFA policy export, latency/error dashboards, RBAC matrix sample, audit log samples with checksums
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: Gate B determines provider onboarding readiness; it does not block auto_com_center go-live.
Gate B pass criteria:
Auth via scholar_auth with RBAC enforcement
Provider onboarding E2E functional, 3% platform fee deterministic and auditable
Webhooks/APIs operational; request_id lineage intact
P95 ≤120ms; error rate <0.1%; audit logs enabled
Evidence bundle with SHA-256 manifest
If FAIL at 18:20 UTC:
Proceed with auto_com_center Gate A/C regardless
Issue remediation ETA and hotfix plan; do not ship partial provider fees logic to prod
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: GO-LIVE READY in Observer Mode; sends remain blocked.
Unblock conditions:
Gate A pass, Gate C pass, Legal sign-off, CEO greenlight post-20:45 UTC review
Prepare day-1 warm-up cohorts and suppression rules; no sends until authorized
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: DELAYED pending Legal (ToS/Privacy/COPPA). Do not launch before sign-off.
COPPA age gate remains server-side enforced; feature flag stays OFF until Legal clears language.
Risk, compliance, and SLAs

Responsible AI and compliance: Ensure no features enable academic dishonesty; preserve explainability in scholarship recommendations; maintain auditability for key decisions.
Regulatory: COPPA/FERPA posture reviewed; confirm DPA with Postmark and subprocessor list. Retention and deletion policies must be published.
SLOs: 99.9% uptime, ~120ms P95 latency across portfolio. Pager triggers aligned with rollback thresholds above.
ARR ignition and KPI focus

ARR ignition window: Nov 13–15 remains ON TRACK contingent on tonight’s gates and Legal.
KPIs to track daily post-go-live:
B2C: free→paid conversion, ARPU from credits, email-driven conversion lift
B2B: active providers, GMV, 3% fee revenue
CAC: organic SEO lead volume and conversion from Auto Page Maker pages
Reliability: deliverability %, P95 latency, error rates
Roles, access, and execution orders

Agent3 role confirmation:
You are DRI for auto_com_center Gate A.
You are Release Captain for provider_register Gate B and portfolio evidence consolidation.
Repository access:
Proceed to auto_com_center workspace now. If access is missing, Ops will grant immediate access; escalate to Ops On-Call with priority P1.
Critical window discipline:
From 19:45–20:30 UTC, do not context-switch from Gate A.
Assign a backup reviewer to collect provider_register evidence if it arrives during this window; final PASS/FAIL remains due by 18:20 UTC.
Deliverables and reporting standards (Section V compliance)

For each app above, publish a Section V-compliant status report with:
Application name and APP_BASE_URL
Status: GO-LIVE READY, DELAYED, or Conditional GO
Evidence links and SHA-256 manifest
If delayed: blockers, realistic go-live date/time, ARR ignition date, third-party dependencies and status
Consolidated package to scholarship_sage by 23:00 UTC:
Gate A/B/C results, auto_page_maker canary, KPI rollups, audit trails, SHA-256 manifest
Answers to open questions

Current UTC time: Use your system clock and CI/CD pipeline timestamps as source of truth for scheduling. Do not rely on manual time calls; all evidence must carry UTC timestamps from the pipeline.
Final approvals

Postmark remains primary; no SendGrid pivot.
auto_com_center: Conditional GO at 20:30 UTC upon Gate A PASS.
scholar_auth: Gate C must PASS; otherwise no portfolio-wide “green.”
provider_register: Gate B is independent; do not block Gate A/C.
student_pilot: Hold pending Legal.
Execute. Provide me:

Gate B PASS/FAIL by 18:20 UTC
Gate A/C evidence summary by 20:45 UTC with clear green/yellow/red indicators
Consolidated evidence by 23:00 UTC
Our 5-year target requires decisive, data-first execution. Keep CAC low via organic growth, protect deliverability, and convert inbox outcomes into revenue.
