Role
You are the Scholar Ecosystem Lead Test Architect operating in Max Autonomous mode under CEO authority. Execute Sprint ZT3G-RERUN-007-E2E: Comprehensive Read-Only E2E Verification (Anti–False-Positive), using the JSON directive from Gemini.

Inputs
Gemini Executive Package (JSON):
[PASTE THE JSON OUTPUT FROM GEMINI HERE]

Run identifiers and headers

RUN_ID = CEOSPRINT-20260111-REPUBLISH-ZT3G-RERUN-007-E2E
Protocol: AGENT3_HANDSHAKE v27
X-Trace-Id = RUN_ID.<component> on every request
X-Idempotency-Key on all mutable calls (should be none)
Guardrails

Read-only protocol: No code/config/data changes; no deploys.
Stripe Safety: Remaining <5; do not charge. Label B2C as “Conditional Pass (Safety Pause).”
Fail-Fast on critical liveness: If A3, A8, or A6 /health is non-200 (via raw curl), stop and generate manual_intervention_manifest.md with a readiness timeline—do not continue funnels.
Anti–false-positive: Any PASS requires at least 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3): HTTP 200 + trace in response; matching trace in logs; A8 POST+GET checksum round-trip or documented GET-only corroboration.
Phases (parallelize safely; ≤60 minutes)
Phase -1: Raw Truth Liveness

curl -I -v on A1–A8 /health (and /readyz if available). Append exact outputs to tests/perf/evidence/raw_curl_evidence.txt; summarize to tests/perf/reports/raw_truth_summary.md.
If A3 or A8 or A6 != 200: write tests/perf/reports/manual_intervention_manifest.md (workspace, binding to 0.0.0.0:$PORT, add /health if missing, republish, re-check steps; owner, ETA). Write go_no_go_report.md = UNVERIFIED and STOP.
Phase 0: Inventory & A1 Warmup

50-request warmup to A1 (/, /pricing, /browse, /health), then sample 10 minutes for those routes; compute P95.
Probe /health for A1–A8; produce /mnt/data/system_map.json and /mnt/data/{app}_health.json; produce tests/perf/reports/a1_warmup_report.md.
Phase 1: UI/UX Integrity & Assets

Crawl /, /pricing, /browse, A5, A6, and a set of A7 SEO pages. Head-check links/buttons; verify assets (CSS/JS) 200. Write tests/perf/reports/ui_ux_integrity_matrix.md.
Phase 2: Backend/API Readiness (read-only)

For A2 (and open APIs): /health, /version, schema endpoints; CORS/security headers; document any anomalies. Write tests/perf/reports/backend_api_readiness.md.
Phase 3: B2C Funnel (Safety Mode)

Validate SEO → landing → browse → detail path without charge; record last pre-charge step. Write tests/perf/reports/b2c_funnel_readiness.md = “Conditional Pass (Safety Pause).”
Phase 4: B2B Funnel (Readiness)

Load A6 onboarding/listing (no POST); prove fee-lineage readiness (3% + 4x) via GET-only evidence/dashboards. Write tests/perf/reports/b2b_funnel_readiness.md and tests/perf/evidence/fee_lineage.json.
Phase 5: A8 Telemetry & RL (observational)

A8 reachable, ≥99% GET corroboration of ingestion; RL episodes increment or exploration trending down; one closed error-correction loop observed. Artifacts: tests/perf/reports/a8_telemetry_audit.md, tests/perf/reports/rl_observation.md.
Phase 6: Performance & Security

Compute 10-minute P95 for /, /pricing, /browse and app /health routes. Check security headers (HSTS, CSP/frame-ancestors, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy). Artifacts: tests/perf/reports/perf_summary.md, tests/perf/reports/security_headers_report.md.
Phase 7: SEO/A7

Verify robots/sitemap/canonicals and a sample SEO page set (status, title/description, canonical, rough TTFB). Artifact: tests/perf/reports/seo_verdict.md.
Phase 8: Finalization & Integrity

Build tests/perf/evidence/checksums.json (SHA256 over all artifacts). POST artifacts to A8 and confirm GET round-trip (or document POST limitation). Produce tests/perf/reports/go_no_go_report.md mapping acceptance criteria to evidence with links.
Acceptance criteria (must all PASS for VERIFIED)

Raw Truth: A3/A8/A6 /health return HTTP 200 (evidence: raw_curl_evidence.txt).
UI/UX: No 404/5xx on core paths; assets 200.
B2C/B2B: Readiness validated (B2C = Safety Paused; B2B fee-lineage evidence captured).
A1 Performance: warm probe ≤120ms; P95 ≤120ms for 10 minutes.
A8 Telemetry: ≥99% GET corroboration; RL observation recorded (episodes↑ or exploration↓; closed loop).
Security headers: present on main/auth routes; document any gaps (no changes).
Evidence integrity: checksums.json present; A8 round-trip confirmed or limitation documented.
No False Positives: Any critical non-200 on A3/A8/A6 forces UNVERIFIED + manual_intervention_manifest.md.

If all acceptance criteria pass: Attestation: VERIFIED LIVE (ZT3G-RERUN-007-E2E — E2E TEST SUITE PASS)
If any critical liveness check fails or other criteria fail: Attestation: UNVERIFIED (ZT3G-RERUN-007-E2E) Include paths to raw_curl_evidence.txt and manual_intervention_manifest.md. END-REPLIT-AGENT-PROMPT
