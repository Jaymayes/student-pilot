CEO Executive Readiness Decision and Orders
Date: 2025-11-07
Time: ~06:40 UTC

Decision: Conditional GO for ecosystem readiness, gated by scholar_auth GREEN TAG at Nov 8, 00:00 UTC. ARR ignition for Nov 12 remains ON. Evidence-first discipline and freeze remain in force.

Portfolio RAG and Directives (by application)

scholar_auth APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app Status: YELLOW (P0 gating risk; OIDC provider 9.5.1 behavior under fix) Orders:
Deliver GREEN TAG by Nov 8, 00:00 UTC with evidence: OIDC discovery + PKCE S256 + client_credentials, token mint/refresh/revoke, session expiry, key rotation, and protected-route redirect proofs.
Provide AUTH_FIXLOG including change diff, timestamps, and rollback plan.
If GREEN TAG is missed at 00:00 UTC, immediate executive escalation. Trigger Contingency A (below).
2. scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (performance headroom; ACID; request_id propagation)
Orders:

Maintain freeze; no schema/RBAC changes.
Within 1 hour of student_pilot E2E completion, post ORDER_4_EVIDENCE with cross-app traces (auth→api→app), latency P95, error budget, and token validation logs.
3. scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (observe-only; fairness telemetry running)
Orders:

Keep auto-apply OFF through Nov 9.
Deliver FAIRNESS_24H_SUMMARY_2025-11-10 by Nov 10, 12:00 UTC (selection parity, FPR by segment, rationale coverage, examples).
4. scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: YELLOW (M2M secret pending)
Orders:

Start M2M baseline within 15 minutes of secret delivery; post baseline evidence by Nov 8, 16:00 UTC.
Ensure advice safety filters GREEN; bind to scholarship_api for context retrieval and log request_id lineage.
5. student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: YELLOW (ready; blocked on auth)
Orders:

Execute 95-step E2E within 30 minutes of AUTH GREEN TAG; post E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE with cross-browser results, First Document Upload, request_id correlation, and error budget snapshot.
6. provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: YELLOW (ready; blocked on auth)
Orders:

Execute ORDER_B within 30 minutes of AUTH GREEN TAG; post ORDER_B_EVIDENCE with client/server validation captures, fee transparency (3% platform fee), and request_id lineage.
7. auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GREEN (SEO/CWV compounding; freeze active)
Orders:

Continue daily 06:00 UTC rollups through Nov 12: pages indexed, IndexNow ≥95%, CWV p75 GREEN, 0% error, P95 ≤120ms, uptime ≥99.9%.
Keep graceful degradation to lead capture ON.
8. auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: YELLOW (external dependencies pending)
Orders:

Confirm SPF/DKIM/DMARC by Nov 8, 12:00 UTC; confirm SQS credentials by Nov 8, 16:00 UTC.
Post deliverability seed-inbox results and spam compliance evidence; verify triggers from scholarship_agent and student_pilot.
Contingency A (if scholar_auth GREEN TAG misses Nov 8, 00:00 UTC)

Immediate exec escalation to me with a 30-minute incident brief.
Enable “closed beta” degraded mode:
Keep all non-auth surfaces live; maximize lead capture (auto_page_maker + student_pilot non-auth funnels).
Pause logged-in E2E/ORDER_B; preserve ARR via SEO compounding and provider waitlist intake.
New deadline for AUTH GREEN TAG: Nov 8, 12:00 UTC hard stop. If missed, contingency B will be enacted (cut scope to basic PKCE web-only + limited client roster, defer refresh token rotation to follow-up, keep hardened revocation path).
Evidence and Reporting Requirements (non-negotiable)

Prominently include Application Name and APP_BASE_URL at top of every report.
Use standardized evidence artifacts:
Auth: AUTH_FIXLOG.md, OIDC_DISCOVERY.json, TOKEN_LIFECYCLE.md, Protected Route Redirect video/GIF, key rotation proof.
API: ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md with request_id end-to-end traces and P95 under load.
Student/Provider: E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md / ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md with validation snapshots and correlation IDs.
Sage/Agent: Baseline/Fairness reports with safety/fairness metrics and examples.
Auto Page Maker: seo/daily_rollup/YYYY-MM-DD.md with CWV, IndexNow, P95, uptime.
Auto Com Center: DNS verification proofs, seed-inbox deliverability, complaint/soft-bounce rates.
Daily consolidated readiness brief at 06:00 UTC through Nov 12: KPI snapshot, freeze compliance, risks, ARR status.
Financial and ARR Guardrails (reaffirmed)

CAC: Organic-only; no paid campaigns before Nov 12.
ARPU: 7-day sensitivity mini-forecast due Nov 10 brief; include conversion assumptions and bands.
Margin: Maintain 4x AI services markup and 3% provider fee; no emergency cost increases.
ARR ignition: Protected by non-auth SEO compounding regardless of logged-in slip within Nov 10 window.
Risk Register (current)

P0: scholar_auth GREEN TAG by Nov 8, 00:00 UTC. Owner: Auth DRI. Escalation: immediate to CEO if missed.
External: auto_com_center DNS/SQS by Nov 8, 12:00/16:00 UTC. Owners: Infra/NetOps, SecOps. Agent3 to track and report.
Responsible AI: scholarship_agent fairness GREEN + scholarship_sage safety GREEN required before any auto-apply. Owner: Agents DRI.
On-Call Roster

Deliver names, roles, and contact channels in the Nov 8, 06:00 UTC brief as committed.
Next Checkpoints I will personally review

Nov 7, 12:00 UTC: Auth interim evidence and risk call; Sage M2M secret status and baseline start.
Nov 8, 00:00 UTC: scholar_auth GREEN TAG evidence package.
Nov 8, 00:30–01:00 UTC: student_pilot E2E and provider_register ORDER_B evidence.
Nov 8, 12:00 UTC: Auto Com Center DNS verification and seed-inbox results.
Nov 8, 16:00 UTC: SQS credentials confirmation; Sage baseline evidence.
Daily 06:00 UTC through Nov 12: Consolidated readiness briefs.
Executive Note

Freeze discipline is non-negotiable through Nov 12 except scoped auth fix documented in AUTH_FIXLOG.
No advancement without documented proof. Evidence gates protect ARR and brand trust.
Student value is business value: do not enable auto-apply until fairness and safety gates are GREEN.
Agent3: proceed per above. Maintain escalation readiness. I expect the 00:00 UTC auth GREEN TAG; if not, invoke Contingency A immediately and brief me within 30 minutes.
