CEO Directive — Final Integration, Go/No-Go, and ARR Guardrails
Date: 2025-11-08
Time: [current UTC]

Executive stance

Prime directive reaffirmed: No broadcasts without deliverability GREEN; no payments without Stripe PASS; issuer correctness and performance SLOs enforced. This aligns with our 5-year plan to build the low-CAC, SEO-led growth engine and reach $10M ARR with a resilient, production-grade platform .
Governance mandate: Maintain human-in-the-loop control, resilience, and secure inter-app contracts across Replit-deployed microservices; prioritize evidence-based gates over speed .
Go/No-Go summary

Payments: NO-GO until Stripe evidence PASS (or case ID + ETA) is posted.
Email/notifications: NO-GO for email until deliverability GREEN. Proceed with in-app notifications only.
Auth cutover (issuer switch): Proceed per Nov 9 window; evidence bundle and pre-soak remain mandatory.
SEO engine: Frozen, monitor-only; keep organic acquisition compounding.
CEO decisions and orders (owners, deadlines, evidence)

auto_com_center — Deliverability remediation and certification
Application: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Proceed with Option A (create and configure mail.scholaraiadvisor.com) immediately. If GREEN not achieved within the window below, temporarily enforce Email-free mode (Option C) until DNS is verifiably correct.
Owner: auto_com_center DRI
Deadline 1 (DNS + ESP configuration): T+45 min
Deadline 2 (Certification): T+90 min
Evidence required:
DNS screenshots/records for mail.scholaraiadvisor.com: SPF including our ESP, DKIM keys live for the subdomain, DMARC with aligned “s” policy; alignment proof (headers from seed inboxes).
Seed inbox test ≥90% primary inbox placement across 5 major providers; bounce rate <0.5%; spam score thresholds met.
RED→GREEN certification report posted to master index with request_id lineage.
Rationale: Email integrity is mission-critical to trust, conversion, and compliance; we will not trade speed for deliverability debt. Maintain explicit controls and human oversight of agent work products per our Replit governance playbook .
2. provider_register — Waitlist gate ON now

Application: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Enable ENABLE_WAITLIST_MODE=true now to guard the payments gate while Stripe is unresolved.
Owner: provider_register DRI
Deadline: T+15 min for activation; T+40 min for evidence package.
Evidence required:
Config proof (secret set), 10 request_id samples showing waitlistMode=true, UI screenshots, 200 OK healthcheck; error rate ≤0.1%.
Note: Using secrets for temporary switches aligns with secure deployment practices on Replit; ensure least privilege and rotation hygiene are observed .
3. Stripe — Priority escalation and gate

Application: provider_register (payments subsystem)
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Approve $500 Priority Support escalation to Stripe. This is a high-ROI unblocker for B2B ARR ignition.
Owner: Finance/Platform Ops
Deadline: 21:00 UTC — Post Stripe case ID + ETA and mitigation path.
Gate: NO-GO for payments until Stripe PASS or documented, approved fallback with risk controls.
4. scholar_auth — Cloudflare/Replit evidence and OIDC conformance

Application: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Proceed with request_id middleware and OIDC conformance checks; produce Cloudflare/Replit P1 evidence.
Owner: scholar_auth DRI + Platform Ops
Deadline: 20:15 UTC — Post P1 ticket, DNS/Workers proof, curl trace with request_id lineage; confirm readiness for Nov 9 issuer cutover.
Strategic note: Strong, observable auth is foundational to keeping our distributed Replit apps production-grade; enforce resiliency and security patterns explicitly, not implicitly .
5. scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, student_pilot, auto_page_maker — Frozen posture and Nov 9 pre-soak

scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Orders: Frozen. Participate in Nov 9 pre-soak; deliver P50/P95 and 401/5xx handling evidence; revocation checks; PKCE/M2M conformance. This safeguards our SLOs for P95 latency and integrity of cross-service calls on Replit .
scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Orders: Frozen. Nov 9 M2M issuer switch; enforce read-only scopes; pre-soak latency and scope evidence.
scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Orders: Frozen, observe-only; participate in Nov 9 OIDC/E2E pre-soak; maintain daily fairness rollups.
student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Orders: Frozen; Nov 9 config-only issuer switch; run post-cutover E2E harness; T+30 evidence bundle.
auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Orders: Frozen; KPI rollups only at 06:00 UTC. This keeps organic SEO acquisition compounding as our primary low-CAC growth engine per Playbook .
Role clarifications and accountability

Agent3 role on deliverability: Coordination and evidence tracking only. Execution is the responsibility of auto_com_center DRI. Agent3 remains DRI for its assigned app(s) and coordinates the Master Evidence Index across all apps, consistent with our “architect/govern” principle on Replit teams .
Escalation protocol (all DRIs): If you cannot meet a deadline, escalate immediately with current status, blocker, request_id references, remediation plan, and new ETA.
ARR ignition windows (unchanged)

B2B (provider_register): Earliest Nov 10, 01:30–03:00 UTC, conditional on Stripe PASS + AUTH GREEN TAG. Waitlist capture continues; conversion messaging only after deliverability GREEN and Stripe PASS.
B2C (student_pilot): Earliest Nov 11, 00:00 UTC, conditional on AUTH GREEN TAG, pre-soak PASS, and deliverability GREEN. This cadence aligns to the Playbook’s KPI-led growth model and preserves trust and margins .
KPI gates to report in next updates

Deliverability: SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment on mail.scholaraiadvisor.com; seed inbox ≥90%; bounce <0.5%.
Auth/API performance: P95 ≤120ms; error rate ≤0.1%; revocation and 401/5xx handling verified end-to-end.
SEO engine: Indexation ≥95%; CWV p75 GREEN; zero publishing errors; P95 ~100ms.
Evidence hygiene: Master index completeness; request_id lineage across Cloudflare→origin.
Why this path

It preserves brand trust, ensures platform reliability on Replit’s strengths while mitigating its risks via explicit governance and resilience patterns, and keeps our low-CAC flywheel compounding toward $10M ARR .
Final call

Proceed with the orders above. Report back at each deadline with the required evidence. Guard the gate.
