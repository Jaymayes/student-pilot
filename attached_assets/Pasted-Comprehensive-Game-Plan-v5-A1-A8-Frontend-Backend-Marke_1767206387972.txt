Comprehensive Game Plan v5 (A1–A8): Frontend, Backend, Marketing, Lead Gen, Revenue

North Star

Objective: Validate a repeatable path to $10M ARR via dual engines
B2C credits/subscriptions: pSEO + lifecycle marketing + first-value product
B2B marketplace fees (3% on awards): provider onboarding → listings → award
Principle: Fix first, then flood. The fleet is green; Phase 1 focuses on validating revenue signals and attribution, then scaling traffic.
Phase 1 sprint (48–72 hours): what we will deliver without changing scope today

Targets by T+72h
A6: ≥1 provider_connected, ≥1 listing_created
A7: JSON‑LD live (validated) + UTMs in CTAs; sitemap re-submitted; first rich-results validation PASS
A3: one warm-up send with delivered/open/click proof; complaint <0.2%
A5: one purchase test (payment_succeeded; credits +50; refund path validated)
A8: dashboards show green windows (A1/A5 latency); tiles for A3 leads, A6 provider events, A7 GSC coverage/clicks, payment_succeeded
Task board (by app): owners, estimates, acceptance criteria, KPIs

Marketing & lead generation plan (Phase 1)

SEO (A7 primary)

Actions now that JSON‑LD is live
Resubmit apex sitemap; Inspect top 50 high‑intent pages; confirm “Redirected” for www URLs
Add internal linking hubs (states/majors) to boost crawl depth (Phase 2 build; Phase 1 plan)
What to watch
GSC Coverage (indexing growth), Rich results eligibility, CTR shifts
KPI: +100 indexed URLs in 30 days; ≥25 UTM clicks in first week
Email (A3 primary)

Warm-up send (5–10 inboxes)
Content: “Upload your transcript to unlock AI matches (5 free credits included)”
Validate delivered/open/click; enforce suppression/cap; log message IDs
KPI: delivered >90%; complaint <0.2%
In‑product nudges (A5/A4 with A8 journeys)

Activation: “Start Free (5 Credits)” hero, empty-state “Upload transcript” prompt
Value → purchase: time‑boxed offer (e.g., 50 credits) after first value (doc upload or first match)
Recovery: checkout abandonment banner (already present) + optional reminder email if consented
B2B provider motion (A6)

Concierge onboarding to unlock provider_connected → listing_created
Spotlight: when listing live, run “Scholarship Spotlight” email to relevant students (A3) to drive 50 qualified applications
KPI: first award (sim/live) → 3% fee calculation validated (Phase 2)
Evidence pack & go/no‑go gates (end of Phase 1)

Evidence required
A7: Rich Results PASS + sitemap resubmission screenshot; A8 UTM click tile ≥25 clicks in week 1
A6: A8 provider_connected + listing_created events (IDs and timestamps)
A5: A8 payment_succeeded + credits ledger +50 + refund proof
A3: ESP deliverability screenshot (delivered/open/click) + A8 lead_captured with UTMs (≥10)
A8: dashboard snapshots with alert settings; first green windows for A1/A5; revenue tiles lighting up
Go/No-Go to Phase 2 (Traffic & Conversion)
YES if: A6 ≥1 provider_connected + listing_created; A7 JSON‑LD validated + UTM clicks trending; A3 email deliverability proven; A5 purchase validated; A8 dashboards complete
NO if any of the above is missing or A5 login p95 >200 ms spikes persist
Risks & mitigations

Email deliverability risk: start small; enforce caps; pivot to double opt‑in if complaints ≥0.2%
SEO rendering variance: confirm JSON‑LD server-rendered; validate with Rich Results Test; resubmit sitemap; monitor Coverage
Provider inertia: concierge live calls; if no conversion by T+48h, escalate and queue backup providers
Telemetry gaps (A1→A8 M2M): P2; not blocking revenue; schedule fix in Phase 2 to restore full observability
