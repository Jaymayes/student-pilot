Agent3 — Executive Direction from CEO, Scholar AI Advisor

Prime directive reminder
All go/no-go decisions and guardrails below are made to accelerate us toward $10M profitable ARR, with zero/low CAC via SEO as the primary B2C engine, strict SLOs, and Responsible AI compliance.

Scope and authority

Your authority today:
Release Captain for the 5-app release train.
DRI with write access for auto_com_center only.
Your obligations as Release Captain:
Coordinate, gate, and approve using evidence from each app’s DRI.
Do not push code to non-owned apps without their DRI’s approval and change control.
Enforce evidence discipline and SLO guardrails; escalate exceptions.
CEO decisions and gates

auto_page_maker
Decision: GO-LIVE READY with canary at 20:00–22:00 UTC; ≤5-minute rollback enforced.
Canary pass criteria:
CWV p75 GREEN sustained.
P95 latency ≤120 ms; error rate ≤0.1%.
IndexNow success ≥95%; indexed pages stability ≥92% retention.
Guardrails:
Rollback if any threshold breached.
Maintain daily 06:00 UTC SEO rollups to scholarship_sage.
Rationale: Zero-CAC SEO engine is our B2C top-of-funnel and is critical to ARR ignition.
2. scholar_auth

Decision: Execute Gate C load test at 20:00–20:15 UTC; conditional GO pending results.
Pass criteria to unblock GA dependencies:
P95 ≤120 ms during test window.
Auth success ≥99.9%; error rate ≤0.1%.
MFA/SSO/RBAC evidence affirmed; token/session security verified.
Roadmap for WebAuthn/FIDO2 accepted for post-GA.
Evidence due: Publish results by 20:30 UTC. If fail, optimize and re-run by 22:00 UTC.
3. provider_register

Decision: CONDITIONAL GO for limited beta after Gate B PASS at 18:00–18:15 UTC; GA blocked until scholar_auth Gate C PASSES.
Gate B pass criteria:
Stripe webhook HMAC signatures verified.
Deterministic 3% platform fee and refund policy tests pass.
Finance sign-off captured in evidence.
P95 ≤120 ms; error ≤0.1%; OpenAPI current; audit logs immutable with request_id lineage.
Evidence due: 18:15 UTC.
4. auto_com_center (your DRI app)

Decision: PROCEED with Gate A at 20:00–20:15 UTC if DKIM checkpoint passes at 14:00 UTC.
DKIM checkpoint success criteria:
SPF/DKIM/DMARC verified and passing; Postmark domain VERIFIED.
Test message shows correct authentication in headers.
Pivot plan: If not VERIFIED by 16:00 UTC, execute ESP fallback (SendGrid or SES) and re-run verification to preserve tonight’s window.
SLO guardrails: 99.9% uptime; P95 ≤120 ms; error ≤0.1% with alerts.
5. scholarship_api

Decision: Proceed post-freeze at 20:00 UTC with DSAR endpoints; join DSAR session 21:00–22:00 UTC.
Requirements:
DSAR endpoints (access, export, delete, status) behind auth; complete audit logging; idempotency where applicable.
WAF/DoS thresholds and per-tenant rate limits documentation due by tomorrow 12:00 UTC.
Maintain P95 ≤120 ms.
Evidence due: DSAR artifacts by 16:00 UTC tomorrow.
6. student_pilot

Decision: COPPA age gate approved behind feature flag; do not enable until Legal sign-off received by 18:00 UTC today.
After Legal approval:
Enable FEATURE_COPPA_AGE_GATE = true by 18:30 UTC.
Confirm ToS/Privacy updates and audit logging for all COPPA blocks.
Confirm onboarding redirects and denial UX in evidence.
Note: If mobile footprint is in scope, prepare offline mode plan by EOD+2.
7. scholarship_sage

Decision: GO (Observer Mode). Continue daily 06:00 UTC cross-app KPI rollups.
Deliverables:
Rate-limit/abuse dashboards fed by auto_com_center telemetry by Nov 13, 23:59 UTC.
CAC and provider revenue tiles by Nov 14 EOD.
PII minimization and clear lineage of data sources in evidence.
8. scholarship_agent

Decision: Observer mode only; no campaign sends.
Requirements to unlock sends:
Scholar_auth P95 ≤120 ms sustained.
auto_com_center deliverability warm-up plan in motion; 14–21 day plan adopted.
Consent workflow verified; HOTL approvals enforced; fairness telemetry active with rationale coverage.
Evidence discipline: Maintain /api/evidence with checksums and Prometheus /metrics exposure.
Cross-app integration and compliance

Mandatory end-to-end checks before GA escalation:
SSO via scholar_auth; RBAC enforced; token/session management validated.
student_pilot reads from scholarship_api; provider_register writes and reconciles fees; email flows via auto_com_center.
HTTPS/TLS verified across apps; audit logs enabled; data at rest encryption confirmed by DRIs.
DSAR joint session tonight 21:00–22:00 UTC:
Validate discovery scope, response SLAs, export format, erasure flow, and evidence artifacts.
Responsible AI:
Maintain bias mitigation, transparency, and anti-cheating safeguards.
scholarship_agent remains HOTL-gated; no autonomous campaigns.
Revenue ignition plan and KPIs

B2C funnel (auto_page_maker → student_pilot credits):
Targets for first 7 days post-canary:
2,500 organic sessions/day
12% “First Document Upload” activation
4% conversion to credits; ARPU $12 per converting user
Daily B2C revenue target after go: ~$1,200; weekly run-rate ~$8,400.
B2B funnel (provider_register):
Limited beta goals by Nov 20:
20 active providers; avg 5 scholarships/provider
Monthly payout volume $50k; 3% fee ≈ $1,500 MRR equivalent; expand to 100 providers by end of Q1.
CAC: Maintain SEO-led zero paid acquisition; grow indexed pages and impressions ≥10% WoW.
Report these KPIs nightly in scholarship_sage rollup and in the 23:00 UTC consolidated evidence:
P95 latency, error rate, uptime by app
Organic sessions, activation, conversion, credits ARPU
Providers onboarded, payout volume, fee revenue
DSAR status and compliance exceptions
Risks and mitigations

DKIM not verified by 16:00 UTC → Pivot to secondary ESP with pre-created DNS templates and re-verify.
scholar_auth Gate C misses P95 target → Immediate optimization sprint and 22:00 UTC retest; provider_register GA remains blocked.
Legal delay on COPPA → Keep feature flag off; publish interim comms and block under-13 flows server-side as implemented.
Evidence drift → Release Captain halts promotion if required artifacts or checksums are missing.
Deliverables and reporting standards

By 14:30 UTC: Publish DKIM checkpoint result and decision path.
By 18:15 UTC: Provider_register Gate B evidence bundle posted and linked.
By 20:30 UTC: Scholar_auth Gate C results posted; PASS/FAIL summary with remediation plan if needed.
By 22:15 UTC: auto_page_maker canary decision posted; proceed or rollback evidence.
By 23:00 UTC: Consolidated evidence update posted to scholarship_sage, including KPI rollup and go/no-go board.
Section V formal status report format requirement
For each app, publish a Section V-compliant status report with:

APPLICATION NAME
APP_BASE_URL
Status: GO-LIVE READY or DELAYED
Brief confirmation of Section IV compliance or explicit blockers
Links to final verification evidence (test reports, API docs, security artifacts) Deadline: include these in the 23:00 UTC consolidated evidence package.
Clarification on scope confusion
I am affirming your Release Captain role and auto_com_center DRI ownership. All other apps remain under their respective DRIs. You may coordinate and gate using evidence, but do not expand your write scope without explicit CEO approval. If a DRI is non-responsive or a blocker threatens today’s train, escalate immediately.

Final confirmation

Your plan and infrastructure are approved with the conditions above.
Execute the DKIM checkpoint at 14:00 UTC and manage the release train per schedule.
Hold a strict line on evidence discipline and SLO guardrails.
Communicate PASS/FAIL decisions within the stated SLAs and escalate exceptions.
Act with urgency. We are protecting the zero-CAC engine, lighting up monetization paths, and moving decisively toward the $10M profitable ARR objective.
