Status: CONDITIONAL GO-LIVE (Private Beta only)

Executive decision

Approve Conditional PASS for Private Beta under strict guardrails. Do not enable public/production campaigns until the hard performance SLO is met.
Rationale: Functional correctness is perfect (30,000/30,000 accepted; zero idempotency/ordering violations). Current P95 latency is materially improved but still above the ≤120ms SLO; risk is acceptable for a capped private beta with automated kill‑switches while we finish the Redis/BullMQ path. We will use phased rollout and fast rollback controls consistent with our deployment playbook , and deepen observability to close the SLO gap in the next retest window leveraging the “Sense-Plan-Act” metrics/logs/traces stack .
Section IV compliance summary (applies to auto_com_center)

Security & compliance: Auth on inbound webhooks (Bearer + HMAC), role-based admin endpoints, TLS enforced. Audit logging active; expand decision traceability for webhook lineage to satisfy our governance standard on explainability and accountability .
Scalability & performance: Architecture updated to 202‑then‑queue; bottleneck now queue concurrency. Redis/BullMQ introduction scheduled to unlock parallel consumers.
Integration & interoperability: Inbound events from scholar_auth; downstream evidence export wired to scholarship_sage; no external sends in observer mode.
Reliability & maintainability: Health checks, structured logs, and disaster rollback plan in place; canary-first with automatic rollback via error/latency thresholds, aligned to our Replit deployment readiness guidance .
Data management & analytics: Event store normalized; lineage metrics to be expanded for end‑to‑end P50/P95/P99 latency and request_id propagation.
Go-live readiness

Functional: PASS. 30K webhook replay Acceptance 100%; Idempotency 0; Ordering 0.
Performance: CONDITIONAL. P95 ≈231ms (goal ≤120ms). Risk accepted only for capped private beta with live SLO monitors and kill‑switch.
Testing: Functional, security, and integration tests complete. Performance retest scheduled post-mitigation (see timeline).
Guardrails for private beta

Rate cap: ≤150 rps. If sustained P95 >250ms for 10 minutes, auto-disable external sends and page on-call.
Error budget: 0.1% max during beta; tripping the budget halts rollout.
Canary: 10% traffic shard; increase only after 60-minute stable window.
Rollback: One-click revert (no data migration dependency), per Replit phased rollout best practice .
Mitigation plan to hit ≤120ms P95

Introduce Redis/BullMQ with 4–6 concurrent consumers; O(1) idempotency set; batched DB writes (10–50 events/txn).
Expand observability: latency histograms at ingress, queue, consumer, DB; distributed request_id lineage to speed RCA .
Tune DB pools and add covering indexes.
Evidence to include decision/audit trace per governance standard .
Timeline

22:00 UTC today: Post‑mortem + owner assignments complete.
00:30–01:30 UTC: Deploy Redis/BullMQ + 1K smoke (P95 ≤120ms required).
02:00 UTC: Full 30K replay PASS checkpoint for SLO.
If PASS: Enable production integration window Nov 13, 16:00 UTC.
ARR ignition

Earliest contribution: Nov 13–15 window, contingent on Gate C (scholar_auth) evidence and Legal clearance for student_pilot, consistent with our FY playbook milestones .
Third‑party dependencies and status

Redis/BullMQ: Pending provisioning for queue + idempotency (BLOCKER for hard SLO).
PostgreSQL/Neon (event store): Active; pool tuning in scope.
Sentry/log pipeline: Active; add span attributes for webhook lineage.
Replit deployment (autoscale/canary/rollback): Active; follow production checklist controls .

CEO directives to close Gate A

Proceed with private beta under guardrails above.
Provision Redis immediately; target ≤120ms P95 by 02:00 UTC retest.
Deliver evidence bundle with latency histograms, lineage traces, RBAC test matrix, and immutable audit log chain.
Maintain observer mode for scholarship_agent until Gate A and Gate C PASS.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY

Section IV compliance summary (applies to scholarship_api)

Security & compliance: TLS enforced; RBAC on admin; audit logging enabled.
Scalability & performance: P95 <10ms; 100% uptime over the last attested window; no change window violations.
Integration & interoperability: Serves as the system of record; documented endpoints for student_pilot, scholarship_sage; aligns with our “API-as-a-Product” governance and centralized observability guidance for autonomous services .
Reliability & maintainability: Backups and DR procedures in place; blue/green-ready deployments and instant rollback per Replit checklist .
Data management & analytics: Data integrity checks and BI extracts available for scholarship_sage.
ARR support

Indirect revenue driver: Powers B2C/B2B flows; ready to support ARR ignition dates in the Playbook V2.0 plan .
Evidence

SECTION_V_SCHOLARSHIP_API_STATUS.md (operational attestation)
SCHOLARSHIP_API_MONITORING_CONFIRMATION.md (SLO, uptime)
SEV2_REDIS_DEGRADATION_TICKET.md (preventive action plan)
Portfolio notes (for cross‑gate alignment)

scholar_auth (Gate C): Require MFA/SSO/token lifecycle/RBAC/audit evidence by next checkpoint to align with our Responsible AI and security posture commitments .
student_pilot: HOLD pending Legal ToS/Privacy/COPPA; otherwise ready for B2C ignition.
auto_page_maker: Canary GO at 22:15 UTC with CWV guardrails; critical to our low‑CAC growth engine per strategy .
Next executive checkpoints

22:00 UTC: Gate A post‑mortem sign‑off; Gate C evidence review.
00:30–01:30 UTC: Gate A mitigation deploy + 1K smoke.
02:00 UTC: Gate A 30K replay PASS/FAIL decision.
09:00 UTC Nov 13: GO/NO‑GO for production enablement.
This decision maintains velocity toward the Nov 13–15 ARR ignition window while honoring our SLOs, governance, and Responsible AI commitments.
