Decision: Option A — parallel, time-boxed verification now, then run the live-$ test

Rationale

We optimize for urgency and low-CAC growth. A fast, parallel verification to first live dollar aligns to the Playbook’s growth engine and our path to scale via SEO and partnerships while building the B2B engine over time .
We maintain a security-first posture on the way to SOC 2 as a revenue enabler, without stalling execution .
What to do now (15 minutes, parallel)
Assign one owner per app; run in their own workspace. Share only key prefixes/screenshots, never full secrets.

scholar_auth (IdP) — Owner: Auth Lead
Prove JWKS 200 and latency
Issuer and audience values
401/200 round-trip (or documented JWKS-only flow) GO gate: Same issuer/audience across all apps
2. scholarship_api — Owner: API Lead

AUTH_JWKS_URL points to scholar_auth JWKS
CORS allowlist = ecosystem origins only (no wildcards)
Protected endpoint 401 w/o token; 200 with token
Credit ledger endpoints (purchase, balance) listed and reachable
3. provider_register — Owner: Payments Lead

Replit Secrets: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (sk_live_), VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY (pk_live_), STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (whsec_) — screenshot prefixes only
Stripe Dashboard (LIVE mode) webhook screenshot: URL to /stripe/webhook; events payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.payment_failed
NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET present; prefix match with auto_com_center
4. auto_com_center — Owner: Comms Lead

NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET present (matches provider_register first 8 chars)
POST /send-notification smoke test returns 200
5. student_pilot — Owner: Frontend Lead

SCHOLARSHIP_API_BASE_URL configured
Browser console screenshot at /checkout or /billing (no CORS/401/403)
Network tab: “Pay” routes to provider_register domain and then Stripe
GO criteria (must be true)

All 8 artifacts pass (above)
No wildcard CORS; JWT iss/aud aligned; Stripe LIVE keys + LIVE webhook; secrets match between provider_register and auto_com_center
NO-GO triggers (any = stop)

Issuer/audience mismatch
Missing or TEST Stripe keys/webhook
Open CORS (*) on scholarship_api
Notification secret mismatch
Immediate execution after GO (13 minutes)

T+0: Issue GO; open billing/checkout in student_pilot
T+2: Execute $9.99 purchase (test card per Stripe LIVE policies if applicable)
T+6: Verify credits posted; capture API balance + ledger screenshots
T+10: Confirm receipt email sent by auto_com_center
T+13: Package “First Live Dollar” bundle for the board: Stripe payment ID, credits granted, API balance, notification message ID
Same-day follow-ups (execution to revenue)

B2C engine: Prioritize Auto Page Maker to compound organic traffic (core lever for MAU growth) and tighten the SEO loop with fresh sitemap.xml and linking back to student_pilot. This is our low-CAC growth flywheel per the Playbook .
Security posture: Lock CORS, JWT validation, and secrets handling; plan SOC 2 track as a revenue enabler (B2B trust) per roadmap .
Accountability and reporting

Each owner posts proof artifacts in one thread with time stamps.
After the live-$ run, I want:
First-dollar KPI snapshot: CAC (est.), ARPU baseline from credits, conversion rate from checkout, notification delivery metric
“Production Status Report: [APP_NAME]” in the 4-section format across all apps by EOD (Current Status %, Integration Check, Revenue Readiness with time-to-MVP if No, Third-Party Dependencies with env detection)
If any owner is blocked, signal immediately; we’ll reassign to maintain the 15-minute clock.

Proceed with Option A.
