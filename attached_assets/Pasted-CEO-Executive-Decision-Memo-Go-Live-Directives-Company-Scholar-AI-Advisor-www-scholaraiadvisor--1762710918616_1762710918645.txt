Company: Scholar AI Advisor (www.scholaraiadvisor.com)
Date/Time: 2025-11-09, 18:10 UTC

Prime directive reaffirmed: Protect brand trust and the SEO flywheel while executing the go-live plan toward $10M profitable ARR. Evidence-first posture. No external comms or charging until CEO GREEN after posted evidence.

Immediate Executive Decisions and Orders

DNS_READY missed at 17:30 UTC — Escalation authorized now
Decision: Proceed with CTO escalation and execute the pre-approved fallback subdomain per the deliverability runbook immediately.
Requirements:
Treat fallback as T0. Start T+90 certification as soon as DNS propagation and ESP verification complete.
Postmark: add sending domain, return DKIM CNAMEs to Ops, confirm SPF/DMARC alignment, DMARC p=quarantine enforced.
Evidence due within 15 minutes of T+90 completion: DNS record proofs, ESP verifications, 7 seed inbox headers/placement, bounce and blocklist screenshots, and a clear GREEN/RED call.
2. Tonight’s pre-soak (20:00–21:00 UTC) — Proceed

Decision: Authorized for student_pilot and all participating dependencies.
Guardrails (all must PASS; breach triggers immediate rollback + 60-minute RCA):
Uptime ≥99.9%
P95 ≤120ms service-side (≤200ms E2E)
Error rate ≤0.1%
request_id lineage across auth → API → app
PKCE correctness + immediate token revocation proof
No PII in logs (FERPA/COPPA) + Responsible AI controls active
Evidence due 21:30–22:00 UTC: P50/P95 histograms, uptime, error tallies, PKCE and revocation proof, request_id lineage, no-PII log validation, concise exec summary with PASS/FAIL.
3. Payments (Stripe PASS) — Deadline enforced

Decision: Maintain freeze on charging until Deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS + CEO GREEN.
If Stripe PASS not delivered by the stated deadline, escalate to COO immediately with ETA and mitigation. Test refunds must remain at 100% in the meantime.
4. scholar_auth background token cleanup

Decision: Non-blocking for pre-soak; must be fully resolved with RCA by Nov 12 EOD to proceed to GA. Track any recurrence in tonight’s evidence.
5. Change-control posture — Maintain

No vendor switch. No dedicated IP unless seed placement remains <80% after two documented remediations.
Freeze on non-essential changes remains in effect through soft launch.
No external comms or charging until CEO GREEN after evidence review.
Go/No-Go Framework for Soft Launch

GO (Nov 11, 16:00 UTC): Pre-soak PASS + Deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS + posted evidence.
CONDITIONAL GO (Nov 12, 16:00 UTC): One gate slips ≤24h with mitigation and posted evidence; CEO approval required.
NO-GO: Any unresolved gate or missing/late evidence.
KPI and SLO Targets (locked)

Deliverability: ≥90% inbox, ≤10% Gmail Promotions (transactional), ≤0.3% bounce, zero blocklists, ≥40% open on activation.
Activation (student_pilot): ≥35% first-session activation (first document upload).
Payments: ≥95% auth success, 100% test refunds.
Platform SLOs: ≥99.9% uptime, P95 ≤120ms, error ≤0.1%.
