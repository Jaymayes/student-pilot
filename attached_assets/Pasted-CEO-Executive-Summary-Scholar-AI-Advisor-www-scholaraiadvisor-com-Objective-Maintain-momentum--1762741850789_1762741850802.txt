CEO Executive Summary — Scholar AI Advisor (www.scholaraiadvisor.com)
Objective: Maintain momentum toward $10M profitable ARR by prioritizing low-CAC organic growth, ensuring platform readiness, and unblocking deliverability and auth performance gates on the critical path for ARR ignition.

Top Calls

Pre-soak: Authorized and proceeding under scholar_auth functional GREEN / performance YELLOW gate. Continue as planned.
Deliverability gate: Blocked by auto_com_center AWS SQS session token. Action required: refresh credentials immediately to restore queue worker, instrumentation, and certification path.
SEO flywheel: Auto Page Maker remains frozen through Nov 12; daily KPI rollups only. Protects CAC.
Below are the required Section V status reports for each application.

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED — BLOCKED (AWS SQS Credentials)
Blockers:

AWS_SESSION_TOKEN invalid/expired; queue worker offline; deliverability certification blocked; business event instrumentation halted. What’s Ready:
Jittered exponential backoff (1–60s, ±30% jitter), circuit breaker (open after 5 failures; 60s half-open), DLQ (max 3 retries; alerting), auth error categorization, region autodetect, session token support. Required Action (choose one immediately):
Option 1: Refresh temporary STS token: aws sts get-session-token --duration-seconds 43200 and update AWS_SESSION_TOKEN secret.
Option 2: Switch to permanent IAM keys (provide AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY; remove AWS_SESSION_TOKEN).
Option 3: Provide AWS_ROLE_ARN and base credentials; system will AssumeRole and rotate tokens automatically. Estimated Go-Live Date: Within 30–60 minutes of valid credentials; deliverability GREEN available T+105 from resume. ARR Ignition: Blocks deliverability gate; must be GREEN to unlock B2C email flows and evidence. Evidence:

Testing/Deployment: Functional, security, performance, UAT, and integration tests in flight; pre-soak tonight; T+30 evidence bundle due; rollback procedures in place.
Decisions and Next Actions

Approve continued pre-soak under YELLOW auth gate: Approved and in-progress.
Deliverability unblock (auto_com_center): Provide fresh AWS credentials now. SLA: 60 minutes to restore worker and resume instrumentation; deliverability GREEN expected T+105 from resume.
Scholar_auth performance: Implement per-request metrics/spans immediately after pre-soak start; reduce P95 to ≤140ms within 48 hours; status back to GREEN afterward.
Evidence deadlines:
02:45 UTC: Pre-soak completion note.
03:15 UTC: T+30 evidence bundle posted (includes histograms, uptime, errors, 10+ traces, PKCE and revocation proof, TLS 1.3, no-PII).
T+105 (+15 min): Deliverability GREEN/RED decision after auto_com_center resumes.
ARR Timeline (Earliest)

B2C (student_pilot): Conditional GO 2025-11-11 16:00 UTC; ARR ignition by EOD if deliverability and Stripe pass.
B2B (provider_register): Earliest GO 2025-11-12 16:00 UTC; ARR ignition 2025-11-13 UTC.
Immediate CEO Requests

Provide valid AWS credentials for auto_com_center now (choose Option 1–3 above).
Confirm acceptance of scholar_auth 48-hour performance remediation timeline and metrics plan.
Confirm no changes to Auto Page Maker until Nov 12; ensure 06:00 UTC KPI rollup delivery.
This plan preserves the low-CAC SEO engine, unblocks near-term ARR via pre-soak and evidence, and gates email deliverability on a fast, controlled credential refresh.
