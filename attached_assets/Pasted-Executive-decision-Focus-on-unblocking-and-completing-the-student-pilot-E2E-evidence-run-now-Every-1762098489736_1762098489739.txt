Executive decision: Focus on unblocking and completing the student_pilot E2E evidence run now. Everything else is secondary until Gate 3 E2E is GREEN.

Why this is first

It’s the CEO’s highest-priority deliverable with a 2-hour clock.
It validates our B2C funnel, which drives low-CAC, SEO-compounding growth.
All downstream tracks (B2B RBAC, T+24 Section 7 submissions) depend on this being green.
What you do in the next 120 minutes
0–20 minutes: Remove the “invalid_client” blocker

Auth DRI (owner): Register the production OIDC client for student_pilot at the production issuer.
Issuer: https-only production URL for scholar_auth.
Client ID: student-pilot (confirm exact value in auth registry).
Redirect URIs: production callback routes for student_pilot only. Do not include dev or preview wildcard URIs in production client.
Grants/Scopes: authorization_code + refresh_token; openid, email, profile, offline_access.
Token endpoint auth method: client_secret_post (or the configured standard).
Rotate secrets immediately; do not paste them in chat. Store in secrets manager only.
Frontend DRI (you): Remove any dev issuer from student_pilot config; set the production issuer. Clear caches, rebuild, redeploy.
20–40 minutes: Prove the login round-trip

Verify /.well-known/openid-configuration resolves for the production issuer.
Exercise the full login flow via the UI. Confirm valid ID/Access/Refresh tokens issued; session established; logout clears session.
Capture a HAR of the full auth journey (no secrets included).
40–90 minutes: Execute E2E + evidence capture

Paths to test: Dashboard → Profile → Search (scholarship_api) → Recommendations (scholarship_sage) → Application CRUD.
Evidence to collect (≥30 samples):
Latency: P50/P95/P99 for each critical endpoint; target P95 ≤120 ms.
Success rates: ≥98% auth success; 0 critical 5xx.
RBAC: 401/403 behave correctly when tokens/scopes are missing.
Lighthouse: accessibility ≥90; capture report.
Security: verify the 6/6 headers; CSRF protections in place.
Screenshots: key flows.
Flag any endpoint exceeding the budget; open a ticket with request IDs.
90–120 minutes: Package and submit

Assemble the evidence bundle (HAR, metrics, Lighthouse, screenshots, summary).
Submit the Gate 3 E2E report with a one-page executive summary: status, KPIs, outliers, and remediation items.
Secondary tasks while E2E runs

scholarship_sage DRI: Keep /recommendations contract published and enforce RBAC/scopes; ensure M2M pull from scholarship_api is ready. No failover endpoint needed right now.
scholarship_api DRI: Sustain P95 ≤120 ms; monitor RBAC/JWKS; no new endpoints pre-E2E. Keep failover recommendation endpoint behind a flag and OFF.
auto_com_center DRI: Stay in prep; we’ll validate unsubscribe→send DRY-RUN after infra clears the canary heap pressure.
provider_register DRI: Queue 30-sample RBAC isolation tests after E2E is GREEN.
Risk and escalation rules

If the OIDC client isn’t registered in 20 minutes, escalate to me. Do not proceed with dev issuers or insecure flows. No workarounds that bypass production issuer.
Any secrets previously posted must be rotated now. Treat them as compromised.
Definition of done for this window

student_pilot E2E evidence bundle delivered and GREEN.
Auth success rate ≥98%, critical API P95 ≤120 ms, Lighthouse ≥90, zero critical 5xx.
Recommendations widget verified against scholarship_sage with valid JWT.
Answering your direct question: Focus on student_pilot E2E setup and evidence collection right now. Pair with Auth DRI immediately to register the production OIDC client and clear the invalid_client error. Once you confirm auth GREEN, run the 30-sample E2E and deliver the bundle within the 2-hour window. After that, move to provider_register RBAC evidence.
