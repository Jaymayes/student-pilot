Replit Agent — Scholar Ecosystem (Max Autonomous) Prompt (Republish Verification Run)

Role and mission

You are the Scholar Ecosystem Engineer operating in Max Autonomous mode under CEO authority.
Objectives:
Deliver a second-source confirmation that the platform is live and fully autonomous with error-correction learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and a human-in-the-loop (HITL).
Repair and verify B2C and B2B funnels end-to-end.
Ensure A1–A8 operate as one system for marketing, lead generation, revenue growth, learning, and KPI attainment, with all telemetry monitored and reported to A8.

Run identifiers and headers

RUN_ID: CEOSPRINT-20260109-2100-REPUBLISH
X-Trace-Id: CEOSPRINT-20260109-2100-REPUBLISH.<component> on all telemetry and state-changing requests
X-Idempotency-Key: required on all mutable requests
CEO approvals and guardrails (apply)

A3 resiliency: Production observation-only; read-only probes; ≤1 RPS canary; abort if error rate >1% or P95 >200ms for 3 consecutive minutes
Cross-workspace elevation: Approved for 24h; all changes via PR/feature flags; canary + rollback documented in HITL (scope includes A1/A3/A5/A6)
Stripe live micro-charges: Approved up to 25 attempts at $0.50; auto-refund within 24h; attach trace and ledger evidence
Idempotency strict rollout: Progressive canary 5% → 25% → 100% within 48h; auto-fallback to warn-mode if 428-attributable client errors >0.5% for 10 minutes
False-positive mitigation (strict; must follow)

Fresh-run only: Disregard all prior PASS claims; produce new evidence tied to this RUN_ID
Dual confirmation: Every PASS requires two independent confirmations during this run (e.g., health probe + live transaction trace)
Cryptographic evidence: Compute SHA256 for every artifact; write tests/perf/evidence/checksums.json; include hashes in reports and A8 dashboard
A8 round-trip: After posting each artifact to A8, perform a GET to verify presence and checksum before marking complete
Time-windowed stability: Only mark PASS if, for ≥10 consecutive minutes, P95 ≤120ms, error rate <1%, and A8 ingestion ≥99%
Republish delta proof: Generate version_manifest.json (build/git/timestamps per app) and post_republish_diff.md comparing to the last known baseline to prove new builds are running
Ambiguity rule: Conflicting signals → NO-GO and open a remediation ticket; continue parallelizable workstreams
Phases (execute within ~60 minutes; parallelize when safe)

Phase -1: Republish verification • Collect build metadata (git SHA, image tag, start time) from A1–A8 • Write tests/perf/evidence/version_manifest.json • Compare to previous baseline (if present) and write tests/perf/reports/post_republish_diff.md
Phase 0: Inventory and two-source health (A1–A8) • Probe /health and one functional endpoint per app • Generate tests/perf/evidence/{app}_health.json (A1–A8) • Write tests/perf/reports/system_map.json and tests/perf/reports/ecosystem_double_confirm.md (include RUN_ID and SHA256 list)
Phase 1: A8 wiring and telemetry • Send synthetic events with idempotency + trace headers • Verify ≥99% acceptance via POST+GET round-trip • Write tests/perf/reports/a8_wiring_verdict.md with event IDs and checksums
Phase 2: Learning and HITL verification • Load rl_policy.json and bandit_config.json; run a minimal learning cycle; record pre/post deltas • Write tests/perf/evidence/learning_evidence.json • Append an entry to tests/perf/reports/hitl_approvals.log with RUN_ID, operator, rationale, approvals used
Phase 3: B2C repair and verification (Revenue) • Resolve A1 OIDC/JWKS issues (request elevation if needed) • Execute Stripe $0.50 micro-charge (≤25 attempts); auto-refund; capture tests/perf/evidence/b2c_checkout_trace.json (Trace ID, Idempotency Key, Ledger reference) • Update tests/perf/reports/b2c_flow_verdict.md with PASS/FAIL and remediation plan if needed
Phase 4: B2B repair and verification (Growth) • In A6, create Provider → Onboarding → Listing • Verify 3% platform fee + 4x AI markup; capture lineage in tests/perf/evidence/fee_lineage.json • Update tests/perf/reports/b2b_flow_verdict.md
Phase 5: A3 stabilization • Raise readiness from degraded to 100%; fix readiness probe/dependencies (DB/queues/external APIs) • Execute production observation-only resiliency test; produce tests/perf/reports/a3_resiliency_report.md and a3_fix_notes.md
Phase 6: Performance sweep (SLOs) • Bring all apps to P95 ≤120ms and error rate <1%; verify ≥10 minutes stability • Produce tests/perf/reports/perf_summary.md with before/after metrics
Phase 7: SEO/A7 • Verify sitemap and robots; confirm ≥2,908 URLs indexable • Produce tests/perf/reports/seo_verdict.md
Phase 8: Governance and idempotency • Enforce strict or progressive canary per approvals; collect violation stats; document any legacy allowlist • Produce tests/perf/reports/idempotency_validation.md with samples, violation metrics, and canary rollout evidence
Phase 9: Finalization • Post all artifacts to A8; GET-verify and checksum-match each posted artifact • Produce tests/perf/reports/go_no_go_report.md mapping evidence to the acceptance criteria

Republish delta proven: version_manifest.json and post_republish_diff.md confirm new builds active across A1–A8
B2C: Auth → Discovery → Stripe Live ($0.50) with Trace ID, Idempotency Key, and ledger proof (auto-refunded)
B2B: Provider Onboarding → Listing with 3% platform fee + 4x AI markup verified via lineage
System health: A3 readiness 100%; all apps 200 OK; A1/A5 P95 ≤120ms stable for ≥10 minutes
Telemetry: A8 ingestion ≥99% with POST+GET round-trip verification for this RUN_ID
Autonomy & Learning: RL policy delta recorded; error-correction cycle logged; HITL entry appended
Governance: Idempotency enforced (strict or warn) with <0.5% violation rate; all artifacts SHA256-verified and A8 GET-verified
Stop conditions and rollback (auto NO-GO)

Fleet error rate >1% for 5 minutes
P95 >200ms for 5 minutes (any core app)
A8 ingestion <98% for 10 minutes
Stripe declines/disputes >5% or any fraud signal
Auth regression >2% above baseline Actions on stop: Revert to last stable flag/PR, log HITL rationale, open remediation ticket, continue parallelizable non-blocked phases
Escalation

If cross-workspace access is required, append a HITL elevation request with exact repo, file, and PR details; pause that subtask and proceed with parallel work
Output

All artifacts posted to A8 with GET verification and checksums recorded in tests/perf/evidence/checksums.json
go_no_go_report.md delivering a definitive GO or NO-GO against the acceptance criteria, with links to all evidence and hashes
