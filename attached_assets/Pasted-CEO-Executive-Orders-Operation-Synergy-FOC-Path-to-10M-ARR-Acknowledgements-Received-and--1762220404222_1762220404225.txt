CEO Executive Orders – Operation Synergy (FOC Path to $10M ARR)

Acknowledgements

Received and reviewed the latest Section 7 reports and 60-minute status updates for: scholar_auth, scholarship_api, scholarship_agent, scholarship_sage, student_pilot, provider_register, auto_page_maker, auto_com_center.
Conditional FOC services: scholar_auth, scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, student_pilot, auto_page_maker, scholarship_agent (observe-only). Remaining gates: provider_register OAuth unblock and auto_com_center infrastructure canary GREEN + DRY-RUN pass.
Executive Decisions (Effective Immediately)

Auth DRI – Provider OAuth Unblock (Order A prerequisite for Order B)
Decision: Execute a “fire-drill” client registration now.
SLA: 15 minutes from receipt of this order.
Actions (must all be completed):
Create or fix OAuth client for provider_register with:
Redirect URIs: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/auth/callback and https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/callback
PKCE S256: enabled
Scopes: openid email profile roles offline_access
CORS origin: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Deliver client_id and client_secret securely to provider_register DRI.
Evidence bundle: OIDC client JSON (redacted secret), JWKS validation sample, and a successful authorization URL test returning code.
Fallback if SLA is missed:
Create a temporary client with a 2-hour secret TTL scoped only to provider role, deliver immediately, and proceed with Order B using that client.
Post-mortem due within 24 hours on why the original client remained invalid.
2. provider_register – Order B GO on Delivery

Decision: Pre-approved to GO immediately upon evidence completion.
Gate: Start as soon as Auth DRI delivers valid credentials.
Required evidence (25 minutes total from credential receipt):
10-minute PKCE verification bundle (HAR, ID token decode, JWKS signature verified, roles=Provider present, request_id chain).
15-minute B2B smoke test: create/update/delete scholarship (Provider=200), negative RBAC test (non-Provider=403), tenant isolation proof, 3% fee disclosure on UI, request_id traces.
SHA256 manifest of artifacts.
CEO will issue provider_register = GO upon receipt; no additional approvals needed if evidence passes.
3. Comms Infrastructure Team – auto_com_center Canary GREEN (Order C)

Decision: Resolve canary heap pressure and turn canary GREEN.
SLA: 60 minutes from receipt of this order.
Acceptance criteria:
Heap utilization ≤85% sustained for 15 minutes at idle and ≤90% during a 10-minute synthetic burst (500 msgs/min).
P95 end-to-end processing ≤120ms in canary; error rate <0.1%; DLQ = 0 during burst.
Allowed mitigations (pick and execute immediately as needed):
Right-size memory/instances; tune GC; reduce message prefetch/concurrency; scale queue partitions; enable backpressure at producer.
Fallback if SLA is missed:
Execute reduced-volume canary (250 msgs/min) to achieve GREEN; increase to 500 msgs/min within the next 60 minutes after initial GREEN.
If still blocked, shift canary to alternate region/runner; proceed with DRY-RUN there.
4. scholarship_agent – Order D DRY-RUN Authorization

Decision: Pre-authorized to launch DRY-RUN immediately when auto_com_center declares canary GREEN.
DRY-RUN parameters (as proposed):
Volume: 30,000 messages @ 500/min for 120 minutes.
Pass criteria: P95 ≤120ms end-to-end, failure rate <0.1%, DLQ growth = 0, opt-out latency <5s, 10 end-to-end request_id traces verified.
Evidence bundle due within 30 minutes post-run (10 artifacts + SHA256 manifest).
Abort conditions:
Any DLQ growth >0, or sustained P95 >150ms for 3 minutes, or failures >0.2% over 5 minutes. On abort, roll back to observe-only and deliver partial bundle + root-cause hypothesis.
5. student_pilot – Order E Monetization Switch

Decision: Pre-authorized to initiate Stripe live mode Phase 1 (10% traffic) immediately after provider_register = GO. Marketing fan-out remains disabled until auto_com_center DRY-RUN PASS.
Guardrails:
Keep observe-only marketing posture; allow only Stripe-native transactional emails.
Rollback to test mode within 60 seconds if payment failure >1% in 24h or refunds >3%.
Phase advancement:
Phase 2 (50%) and Phase 3 (100%) permitted after 24-hour metrics stability and auto_com_center DRY-RUN PASS.
6. Full FOC Declaration Gate

Sequence to Full FOC:
provider_register = GO (Order B evidence approved by CEO).
auto_com_center canary GREEN (Order C acceptance criteria met).
scholarship_agent DRY-RUN PASS with 10-artifact bundle (Order D).
CEO issues production fan-out authorization; declare Full FOC.
If Order C is delayed >4 hours:
Proceed with limited B2C monetization (student_pilot Phase 1 live payments) using Stripe transactional receipts only; keep communications center observe-only; re-evaluate every 2 hours.
Risk, Compliance, and SLO Guardrails

FERPA/COPPA: Audit trails with request_id correlation remain mandatory across all production flows.
Responsible AI: Maintain explainability in scholarship_sage (matchReasons) and never assist academic dishonesty.
Security: Centralized auth only (scholar_auth), HTTPS/TLS everywhere, standardized error format with request_id, RBAC enforced on all protected routes.
SLOs: Uptime ≥99.9%, P95 ≤120ms, error rate ≤0.1%. Any breach triggers an immediate rollback to the last known-good posture.
Week-1 KPI Targets (post-FOC)

B2C:
Organic sessions/day: ≥1,000 (auto_page_maker baseline sustained).
Visitor→signup: 8–12%.
Free→paid: 3–5% (Day 1–7).
ARPU: $8–$12 per paid user (credit packages at 4× AI markup).
B2B:
Providers onboarded: 5–8.
Active listings: 40–60.
GMV equivalent to yield ≥$2,000 in week-1 fee accrual potential.
Ops:
Zero RBAC violations, zero DLQ growth, P95 ≤120ms across services.
Lifecycle and Capital Allocation Confirmation

Infrastructure (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center): 5–7 year horizon; track standards evolution (beyond OAuth 2.0) and scale limits.
User-facing (student_pilot, provider_register): 3–4 year horizon; major UX refresh likely in that window.
Intelligence/Automation (scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker): 2–3 year horizon; draw from the approved $100k Q2 FY2027 refresh reserve; early triggers include API/model EOL, ≥20% performance or quality regression, or competitive price compression on AI services.
Owner, SLA, and Next Update Cadence

Auth DRI (Order A prerequisite): 15-minute SLA to deliver provider OAuth client credentials. Report back with evidence immediately upon completion.
provider_register DRI (Order B): 25-minute SLA from credential receipt to evidence submission. Pre-approved to GO on evidence acceptance.
Comms Infra Team (Order C): 60-minute SLA to canary GREEN. Report status at T+30 and T+60.
scholarship_agent DRI (Order D): Launch DRY-RUN within 5 minutes of canary GREEN; evidence bundle due T+30 post-run.
student_pilot DRI (Order E): Launch Phase 1 immediately after provider_register GO; hold at 10% until DRY-RUN PASS.
Status cadence: Maintain 60-minute updates until Full FOC; shift to daily executive metrics thereafter.
