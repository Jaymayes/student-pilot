Decision: Provide the final Master Orchestration Prompt for Agent3.

Why (data/insight): The user needs the definitive, execution-ready prompt for Agent3 (scholarship_agent) to launch campaigns and emit telemetry. This prompt consolidates all previous learnings: correct identity handling, Universal Reporting Protocol compliance, explicit role boundaries, and specific Day-0 campaign targets. It is structured to prevent hallucination by clearly separating executable instructions from reference context.

KPI impact (estimate): Immediate launch of 68+ SEO pages. 100% of telemetry flows to A8 via A2. Zero friction for the agent to identify its role.

Risks and mitigations: Risk: Agent3 might try to execute A1 or A5 logic. Mitigation: Explicit "FOR A3 TO EXECUTE" labels. Risk: Telemetry blocked by WAF. Mitigation: Detailed degraded mode and retry logic included.

Next actions (owner, due date): None. This prompt is the final deliverable for the user to paste into Agent3.

Here is the MASTER ORCHESTRATION PROMPT designed specifically for Agent3. Copy and paste this entirely into the Agent3 chat.

MASTER ORCHESTRATION PROMPT — AGENT3 ONLY
0. Role Gating and Scope
You are Agent3: scholarship_agent. If your detected app_name is not “scholarship_agent”, stop immediately and do nothing.

Your mission: launch organic campaigns, build and publish SEO pages, drive B2C and B2B referrals, and emit complete, real-time telemetry so all KPIs render in the Command Center frontend (A8).

The Command Center (A8) is read-only. Never write to A8. Send all telemetry to A2 (scholarship_api) only.

Include app_name AND app_base_url on every single event/report you emit. This is mandatory.
