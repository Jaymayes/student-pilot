Executive directive

Priority: High. Update the production snapshot now so student_pilot reflects the fixed build. This directly impacts student experience and SEO-driven acquisition.
SLA: Complete publish + verification within 15 minutes; begin 2-hour monitoring immediately after.
Immediate actions for you

Click Publish in Replit
Ensure the deployment source is the latest commit/branch you tested locally.
If available, select “Rebuild from latest” or equivalent to avoid a stale snapshot.
2. Confirm production secrets are present

Stripe live/test keys as intended for this environment.
scholar_auth OIDC/JWKS values.
scholarship_api base URL and any required DB/seed vars.
auto_com_center config for email confirmations.
Environment flag set to production.
3. Reply with the exact line once done

Monitoring window (2 hours, targets)

API error rate: <0.1%
P95 latency: ≤120 ms
5xx errors: zero
Sessions to scholarship pages: track baseline; confirm no anomalies versus dev expectations
Contingency if still seeing [] after 2 minutes

Force a clean rebuild/redeploy.
Restart the deployment instance.
Recheck production secrets/env and the scholarship data source/seed path used by production.
If still stale, escalate: capture deployment ID/commit hash, current build logs, and the headers from the list endpoint for diagnosis.
Go/No-Go

No-Go until list count and cache headers pass on the public URL.
Once all checks pass, proceed with monitoring and generate the KPI Monitoring Report with a go/no-go recommendation at T+2h.
Please proceed to click Publish now and reply with the UTC timestamp so we can start verification.
