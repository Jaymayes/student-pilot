APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Go/No-Go at 20:00–20:15 UTC)

Summary

Primary ESP: Postmark. DNS (DKIM) propagation underway; DMARC set to p=none per CEO directive.
Contingency: SendGrid pre-staged. Pivot only if both conditions hit at 16:00 UTC: Postmark DKIM not verified or inbox placement <95% after 30 minutes, AND SendGrid fully verified.
Section IV compliance snapshot

Security/Compliance: Auth via scholar_auth; RBAC enforced; HTTPS/TLS; secrets in Replit Secrets; audit logging on. Prepared for SOC 2-style evidence capture. Webhook signing validation on.
Scalability/Performance: Async email queue + rate limits; target P95 ≤120ms; autoscaling rules defined; health checks in place.
Integration: OIDC with scholar_auth; event webhooks consumed by scholarship_sage; campaign orchestration gated by scholarship_agent; notifications to student_pilot; API contracts documented.
Reliability/Maintainability: 99.9% uptime SLO; monitors/alerts configured; daily backups; blue/green deploy with rollback.
Data/Analytics: Event pipeline to scholarship_sage; seed-list deliverability testing; BI exports enabled.
Blockers

DNS: DKIM and Return-Path CNAME verification pending global propagation.
Deliverability: Seed-list test must meet ≥95% inbox placement during Gate A.
Dependencies: Gate C (scholar_auth P95 ≤120ms) must pass.
Estimated Go-Live

Decision window: 20:00–20:15 UTC tonight.
If Postmark passes: GO-LIVE at 20:30 UTC.
If pivot to SendGrid required: GO-LIVE slips to Nov 13, 16:00 UTC.

APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Observer Mode; sends blocked)

Summary

Monitoring and fairness telemetry active; HOTL approval gates enforced; campaign sends locked pending Gate A (auto_com_center), Gate C (scholar_auth), and Legal sign-off.
Next step

Await CEO greenlight post-Gates A + C and Legal. Warm-up plan 14–21 days then scaled sending.
ARR Ignition

Dec 4+ after warm-up completion; earlier value via insights/targeting to student_pilot.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Conditional GO)

Summary

COPPA age gate implemented behind feature flag; server-side <13 block; audit logging active; UX flows complete.
Blockers: Legal sign-off on ToS/Privacy; dependency on Gate A (deliverability) and Gate C (auth latency).
Estimated Go-Live

Nov 13, 16:00 UTC, contingent on above gates and Legal.
ARR Ignition

Nov 13–15 via B2C credit sales at 4x markup.
Third-Party Dependencies

scholar_auth, auto_com_center, analytics stack.
CEO decisions and directives

Approve Gate A deliverability target at ≥95% and DMARC p=none for tonight only. If ≥95% sustained for 48 hours, move DMARC to p=quarantine, then p=reject after 7 days of stable domain health.
Enforce 16:00 UTC pivot rule exactly. Do not pivot if SendGrid is not fully verified by 16:00 UTC.
Evidence discipline: Every gate must publish artifacts within 30 minutes of window close. Missing evidence = FAIL.
Security posture: Confirm MFA and SSO active on scholar_auth and admin consoles; verify RBAC policy coverage across all apps before any public traffic ramp.
Legal: Student_pilot cannot go live without ToS/Privacy sign-off. If not received by 18:00 UTC today, escalate to me with red/amber status and a 24-hour remediation plan.
CAC strategy: No paid acquisition until Auto Page Maker SEO canaries pass tonight’s health checks; publish canary evidence by 22:15 UTC.
Next checkpoints (UTC)

15:30: Auto_com_center readiness check (SPF/DKIM/DMARC/webhooks/seed-list).
16:00: Pivot decision (Postmark vs SendGrid).
18:15–18:20: Provider_register Gate B evidence; Release Captain issues PASS/FAIL.
20:00–20:15: Gates A (auto_com_center) and C (scholar_auth).
20:45: CEO review of Gate A/C evidence; greenlight decision for scholarship_agent warm-up pending Legal.
22:15: Auto_page_maker canary evidence.
23:00: Consolidated evidence package.
Act with urgency. Keep evidence flowing. If any gate risks slipping, escalate to me immediately with a one-line cause and a concrete, time-bound recovery plan.
