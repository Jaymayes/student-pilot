Read-Only Post-Rollback Verification Audit — ScholarshipAI Student Pilot
Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Strict read-only diagnostic. Do not modify data, configs, jobs, or integrations. Do not trigger migrations, reindexing, cache clears, or external calls. Use only existing telemetry, stored reports, and read-only endpoints. If anything is missing, return UNKNOWN and list the minimal instrumentation to collect it.

Objective
Verify that the rollback to the last known-good state was executed and that all P0 blockers are cleared or have met interim thresholds. Provide PASS/WARN/FAIL with evidence IDs and a go/no-go decision to move from RED to YELLOW.

Verification checks (must include evidence IDs: log/report names + timestamps)
A) Rollback confirmation

Expect: App build/version and DB migration tag match “last known-good”; no schema drift alerts.
Evidence: version banner or /about info, migration log/report ID, and last 24h application logs with 0 occurrences of 42P01 (or equivalent “relation does not exist”).
B) DB schema integrity

Expect: cohort_users relation exists and is accessible to the app; dependent queries succeed.
Evidence: latest app logs showing successful cohort queries; diagnostics with row count and last_write_timestamp (read-only).
C) Analytics/BI availability

Expect: TtvDashboardTile renders successfully; medianTTV, p95TTV, MAU, conversion, ARPU are numeric (non-null; zero allowed).
Evidence: dashboard render trace IDs and sample API payload with values and timestamp.
D) Revenue observability

Expect: Read-only ARR summary available (B2C, B2B, Total) with last-generated timestamp.
Evidence: report name/ID or cached snapshot log lines with values.
E) SLO performance (last 24h)

Expect: P95 latency ≤ 250ms and error rate ≤ 1.0% (interim); show P50/P95/P99.
Evidence: performance dashboard/log IDs and distribution snapshot.
F) Security parity

Expect: HSTS/CSP/X-Frame-Options present; /.well-known/security.txt returns 200 with Content-Type: text/plain.
Evidence: header capture and endpoint status.
G) SEO sanity

Expect: Valid sitemap; URL count reported; no XML errors.
Evidence: sitemap fetch log ID and validator reference (internal).
H) Guardrails

Expect: Agent Bridge disabled or dry-run; no autonomous campaigns executing.
Evidence: config/status report ID.
KPIs to report (Current vs Year 1 targets; UNKNOWN on MAU, conversion, or ARR = FAIL)

MAU (28d, 90d)
Free→Paid conversion rate
ARPU (credit sales)
ARR (B2C, B2B, Total)
P95 latency (24h), error rate (24h)
Indexed pages (from sitemap or internal inventory)
Scoring thresholds

Variance >10% vs plan = WARN; >20% = FAIL.
Any UNKNOWN for MAU, conversion, or ARR = FAIL for this gate.
Output format

Executive summary (5–8 bullets) with decision: Green/Yellow/Red.
KPI table: Current, Target, Variance%, Status (PASS/WARN/FAIL), with evidence IDs.
A–H results with PASS/WARN/FAIL and evidence IDs.
Endpoint health table: /health, /sitemap.xml, /.well-known/security.txt, and analytics/revenue endpoints used; include status code, last-seen P95 latency, last error, evidence ID.

Constraints

Strictly read-only. If evidence is unavailable, return UNKNOWN and specify the minimal instrumentation required (metric name, event/schema or log, and where it should surface).
