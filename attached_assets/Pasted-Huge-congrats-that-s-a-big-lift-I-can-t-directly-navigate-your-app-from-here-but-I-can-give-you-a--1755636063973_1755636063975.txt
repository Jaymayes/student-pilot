Huge congrats—that’s a big lift. I can’t directly navigate your app from here, but I can give you a fast, high-signal review checklist and some concrete sanity tests you (or your team) can run on the Credits tab right now. If you share a staging URL, a temporary test account, or screenshots, I’ll give targeted UI/UX feedback.

Quick visual/UX checklist for the Credits tab

Balance card
Shows balance in Credits with 2 decimals and USD equivalent (Credits/1000).
Clear “Add credits” CTA; returns to page with updated balance after Stripe.
Low-balance banner and an easy link to purchase.
Packages grid (Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
Each card shows price, total credits, any bonus, and “best value” badge for the top plan.
Buy button handles loading/disabled states; cancels from Stripe return gracefully.
Display the effective $/1k credits or % savings vs Starter to help decisions.
Rate card panel
Credits per 1k input/output tokens per model (e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini).
“Last updated” timestamp, short note: “We only charge based on actual token usage.”
Usage table
Columns: Date, Model, Input, Output, Charged Credits, Request ID.
Filter by model/date, CSV export, and pagination.
Row click drills into a usage detail (optional).
Ledger table
Columns: Date, Type (Purchase/Deduction), Amount, Balance After, Ref (Stripe/OpenAI).
Running balance matches current balance; export works.
Error/empty states
Insufficient credits: page shows clear CTA to add credits; API returns 402 with requiredCredits/currentCredits.
Stripe webhook delay: temporary “Purchase pending” note until fulfillment lands.
High-confidence functional tests with expected results
Use these to verify math, rounding, and display. Assumes 4x rate card: gpt-4o-mini (2.4 in, 9.6 out), gpt-4o (20 in, 80 out) credits per 1k tokens.

Test A: gpt-4o-mini, 1,000 in, 1,000 out
Expected: 2.4 + 9.6 = 12.0 credits charged.
If you show USD: $0.012 equivalent.
Ledger: a single deduction entry for 12.0 credits; balance decremented accordingly.
Test B: gpt-4o, 10,000 in, 2,000 out
Expected: (1020) + (280) = 200 + 160 = 360 credits.
Test C: gpt-4o-mini, 750 in, 200 out
Expected: (0.752.4) + (0.29.6) = 1.8 + 1.92 = 3.72 credits.
If ROUNDING_MODE=ceil: 4 credits. If exact: 3.72 credits (3,720 millicredits).
Test D: gpt-4o, 1,234 in, 567 out
Expected: (1.23420) + (0.56780) = 24.68 + 45.36 = 70.04 credits.
Ceil mode → 71. Exact mode → 70.04.
Test E: Stripe purchase → fulfillment
Buy Starter, complete checkout, return to app.
Webhook applies credits once; refresh shows increased balance.
Duplicate webhook events do not double-grant (idempotent).
Ledger shows one purchase entry and updated running balance.
Data integrity checks

Ledger invariants
Sum(all ledger deltas) = current balance.
No negative balances post-transaction; insufficient credits errors are shown.
Usage vs ledger reconciliation
Sum(usage.chargedMillicredits) over a period equals sum of ledger deductions for that period.
Rate snapshotting
Old usage rows show the rates applied at the time, even if rate card later changes.
Concurrency and resilience checks

Fire two simultaneous OpenAI calls when balance barely covers one.
Exactly one should succeed; the other returns 402.
Stripe cancel flow
Cancel checkout; app returns to Credits tab without granting credits and with a polite message.
Webhook outage
If webhook is temporarily down, a retry later grants credits; no duplicates.
Pricing and packages feedback

Naming: Starter, Professional, Enterprise is clean. Consider adding a lower-friction middle tier ($20 “Basic”) to raise first-purchase conversion.
Bonuses
Professional: 5% bonus feels right.
Enterprise: 10% bonus is a strong value anchor.
Show “Save X% vs Starter” on each card.
Transparency
Show “1,000 Credits = $1.00” and a mini “Cost estimator” right on the page (paste text, choose model → estimate credits).
Small UX enhancements that pay off

Auto-recharge: Toggle to auto-buy Starter or Professional when balance < threshold.
Alerts: Email and in-app alerts at low balance (e.g., < 500 credits).
Budget controls: Allow monthly cap or per-model caps.
Model labels: “Eco (gpt-4o-mini)” vs “Advanced (gpt-4o)” in both the app and the usage table.
Receipts: Link ledger purchase entries to Stripe receipts.
If you can share:

A staging URL and a test login (or magic link).
A short screen recording of the Credits tab.
Or even just screenshots of the balance card, packages section, rate card, and a couple of rows from usage/ledger.
I’ll give concrete UI copy suggestions, visual tweaks, and any gaps I spot.
