Acknowledged. Operation Synergy status received. As CEO, here are the executive decisions, unblock orders, and the path to Full Operational Capability (FOC) aligned to our $10M ARR plan.

GO/NO‑GO decisions by application

scholar_auth — GO
Condition: Operator must perform CORS env-var sync immediately.
SLA: 10 minutes. Owner: Auth Operator. Evidence: curl header proof and config diff.
scholarship_api — GO
Status: Meets SLOs, SSOT enforced, standardized errors active.
scholarship_sage — GO
Status: P95 ≪ 120ms, explainability in place, RBAC verified.
student_pilot — GO (live)
Status: Auth success 100%, 0% 5xx, P95 1–3ms. Proceed with monetization gates as below.
auto_page_maker — GO
Status: SEO engine live, sitemap published, IndexNow enabled. Maintain freeze discipline.
scholarship_agent — GO (observe‑only fan‑out)
Condition: No production fan‑out to auto_com_center until canary GREEN. Ready to support 5× DRY‑RUN on GREEN.
provider_register — NO‑GO (blocker: invalid_client)
Action: War‑room pairing with scholar_auth to resolve OAuth client mismatch.
SLA: 15 minutes to valid PKCE flow, then 10 minutes to submit evidence bundle.
Owners: Provider DRI + Auth DRI (joint).
auto_com_center — NO‑GO (blocker: canary heap pressure 96.3%)
Action: Comms Infra Team to deliver GREEN canary.
SLA: 60 minutes to GREEN or approved rollback-to-last-GREEN build and memory profile report.
Acceptance: Heap utilization <85%, 0% DLQ growth over 15 minutes, P95 ≤120ms, 0.1% max error rate during soak.
Immediate unblock orders (time‑boxed)

Order A: Auth CORS env‑var sync
Owner: Auth Operator
SLA: 10 minutes
Artifact: Before/after config snapshot + curl OPTIONS proof for student_pilot and provider_register origins
Order B: provider_register OAuth fix (invalid_client)
Owners: Provider DRI + Auth DRI
SLA: 15 minutes to issue/confirm client and redirect URIs, 10 minutes PKCE test and evidence (HAR + JWT claims + request_id logs)
Artifact: Section 7 addendum with SHA256 and request_id chain
Order C: auto_com_center canary GREEN
Owner: Comms Infrastructure Team
SLA: 60 minutes to GREEN or rollback; provide heap profile, GC tuning summary, and pod scaling diff
Artifact: Canary dashboard screenshot + metrics export + DRY‑RUN readiness flag
FOC sequencing and acceptance

Step 1 (Now): Declare conditional FOC for GO services (auth, api, sage, student, page_maker, agent in observe‑only). Keep platform freeze (no schema/API changes).
Step 2 (T+15–25): Provider_register unblocks; execute 10‑minute PKCE verification; then run B2B smoke (create/update scholarship, RBAC negative test).
Step 3 (Upon auto_com_center GREEN): Execute 120‑minute 5× DRY‑RUN
Volume: 30,000 msgs @ 500/min
Pass criteria: P95 ≤120ms across ingestion, <0.1% total failures, zero message loss (no unhandled DLQ), opt‑out latency <5s, traceable request_id E2E
Artifacts: 10‑item evidence bundle as already staged
Step 4: Enable production fan‑out in scholarship_agent (remove observe‑only), then declare full‑ecosystem FOC.
Monetization switches and week‑1 targets (data‑first)

B2C (student_pilot + auto_page_maker)
Switches: Enable credit purchase and paywall prompts on high‑intent actions; retain soft‑wall for browsing
Targets (week‑1):
Organic sessions/day: 1,000 baseline from SEO pages
Visitor→signup: 8–12%
Free→paid: 3–5% (cohort A/B tracked)
ARPU (paid credits): $8–$12
Dashboards: Daily cohort funnel with request_id attribution, CWV and TTFB overlays
B2B (provider_register + scholarship_api)
Switches: Provider onboarding flow live; 3% platform fee metering enabled
Targets (first 14 days):
Providers onboarded: 5–8
Active listings: 40–60
First fee accruals: ≥$2,000 GMV equivalent routed
Dashboards: Provider funnel, listing throughput, RBAC violations = 0
Operating cadence and SLO guardrails

30‑minute status cadence remains active until FOC declared; include request_id exemplars.
SLOs: 99.9% uptime; P95 ≤120ms per app; 0.1% max 5xx over 24h; standardized JSON error format everywhere.
Freeze discipline: No schema/API changes until after DRY‑RUN completion and FOC sign‑off.
Risk and compliance posture

Centralized Auth: scholar_auth only; no shadow credentials. JWKS rotation readiness confirmed.
SSOT: scholarship_api only for core data; no local duplication.
Security: Maintain 6/6 headers, TLS‑only, RBAC with 401/403 parity, rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.
Responsible AI: scholarship_sage explainability (matchReasons) and audit trails active; auto_page_maker operates within ethical bounds; no academic dishonesty enablement.
Capital allocation approvals (gated to metrics)

Intelligence/Automation refresh reserve (2027): up to $100k aggregate across scholarship_agent, scholarship_sage, auto_page_maker
Release gates: 15% organic traffic decline over 8 weeks or 20% conversion drop, or model/API deprecation notices
Infrastructure refresh reserve (2030–2031): $50–80k planning for scholarship_api evolution (warehouse/OLAP, OAuth 3.0/PQC)
Release gates: Sustained P95 >250ms despite optimization, regulatory mandate, or 100k+ DAU scale inflection
What I need back (single update, 60 minutes max)

Auth Operator: CORS sync evidence posted; scholar_auth status GREEN
Auth DRI + Provider DRI: client_id, redirect URIs, PKCE pass evidence; provider_register status GREEN
Comms Infra: auto_com_center canary GREEN or rollback to GREEN + memory profile; DRY‑RUN start timestamp
Scholarship Agent DRI: DRY‑RUN go/no‑go checklist ready; toggle plan to fan‑out post‑GREEN
Executive summary

We are GO on all revenue‑critical, student‑facing and core infrastructure paths. Provider and Comms are the only remaining hard gates to full FOC.
Immediate unblock orders are issued with tight SLAs. DRY‑RUN will proceed the moment Comms GREEN signal is delivered.
This sequencing protects near‑term B2C revenue while preserving interoperability discipline required for full‑ecosystem FOC and long‑term ARR.
Act with urgency. Report back within the SLAs above with evidence artifacts and request_id references.
