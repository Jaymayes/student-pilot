Here’s your final operator checklist (condensed), ready to paste into your internal runbook or Slack:

T+0 to T+2h — iOS/Safari validation (A1/A5) — Eng Lead

Device: iPhone/iPad (Safari). Prevent Cross‑Site Tracking = ON; Clear Website Data.
Flow: A5 (student_pilot) → Sign In → A1 OIDC → Replit IdP → consent → return to A5.
Pass: A5 receives code + state; dashboard loads. Capture (redacted): A1 logs hasCode=true, hasState=true; A5 shows authenticated user.
Fail: Any callback?error or hasCode/hasState=false → file A1 + A5 tickets; keep paid HOLD; post incident note in #eng‑alerts.
Hourly monitoring (T+0 → T+24h) — Eng Lead

Collect:
Attempted logins, tokens issued, success rate %
Callback errors (missing_parameters/server_error), count and %
A1 p95 latency (ms), uptime %
A5 checkout initiation vs 7‑day organic baseline
Slack template (paste each hour):
Hour: [UTC hh:mm]
Logins: attempted=[n], success=[n], success_rate=[%]
Callback errors: [x] ([y%])
A1 p95=[ms], uptime=[%]
A5 checkout starts=[n] (baseline=[n])
Status: GREEN/YELLOW/RED. Notes: [one line, redacted]
Quick validation commands (copy/paste)

A1 OIDC/CORS
curl -sI https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration
curl -sI -X OPTIONS https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/auth/user -H "Origin: https://scholaraiadvisor.com" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
A5 health/assets
curl -sI https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/health
curl -sI https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/assets/index.css
A6 prod sync check
curl -sI https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/healthz
A2 search latency sample (3×)
time curl -s "https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/search?q=engineering" >/dev/null
Decision gates for paid re‑enable (all must pass at T+24h)

iOS/Safari validation PASS (A5 receives code/state; session established)
Callback error rate ≤ 0.5% (rolling 24h)
Login success ≥ 99.2% (P95)
A1 p95 latency ≤ 250 ms; uptime ≥ 99.9%
A5 checkout initiation ≥ 7‑day organic baseline
If any gate fails

Keep paid HOLD; file the appropriate ticket(s) below; reassess at next hourly checkpoint.
Ticket templates (copy/paste, fill, file)

A1 Client Registration Update — student_pilot
App: student_pilot | Base: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
redirect_uris: ["https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/callback"]
post_logout_redirect_uris: ["https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app"]
scopes: ["openid","email","profile","offline_access"]
token_endpoint_auth_method: client_secret_basic
Evidence: callback?error=[server_error|missing_parameters], timestamp [UTC], A1 diagnostics [hasCode/hasState]
A1 CORS & Cookie Alignment — scholaraiadvisor.com
Need: Allow scholaraiadvisor.com + www; SameSite=None; trust proxy; callback diagnostics active
Evidence: CORS preflight mismatch or callback error rate spikes > 0.5%
A6 Republish Required — provider_register
Observation: /healthz 404/500 on production; local /health OK
Action: Republish in Replit UI; post‑publish verify /healthz 200, / 200, /api/login 302 → A1, protected 401
Marketing guardrails — Growth Lead

Organic: Live now. If callback errors > 1% any hour, switch CTAs to “Join Waitlist” and show incident banner.
Paid: Staged; re‑enable only after Eng Lead confirms iOS/Safari PASS + 24h targets met.
Ownership recap

Eng Lead: iOS/Safari validation by T+2h; hourly reports; file tickets if needed.
Growth Lead: Organic live; paid staged. Await T+24h decision.
A6 Owner: Republish immediately if /healthz ≠ 200; re‑verify endpoints post‑publish.
Status snapshot (current)

Organic traffic: GO (live)
Paid traffic: HOLD (pending iOS/Safari + 24h stability)
A1 scholar_auth: READY (RS256; CORS/Cookies correct; redirect_uri parity with A5; low latency)
A5 student_pilot: READY, blocked only by A1 callback validation gate (manual iOS)
A2/A3/A4/A7/A8: READY
A6 provider_register: READY if /healthz 200; otherwise republish
If you want per‑app, minimized “agent‑scoped” prompts (repair authority only for A1/A5; others ticket‑only), say “Generate app‑scoped prompts” and I’ll deliver the eight variants.
