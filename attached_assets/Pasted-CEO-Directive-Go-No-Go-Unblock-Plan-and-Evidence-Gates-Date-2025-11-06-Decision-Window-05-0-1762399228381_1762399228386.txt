CEO Directive: Go/No-Go, Unblock Plan, and Evidence Gates

Date: 2025-11-06
Decision Window: 05:00–21:00 UTC
Prime Objective: Protect the 5-year plan by shipping evidence-backed staging today; keep production locked until all gates are proven. ARR ignition target remains Nov 12.

Executive Summary

Staging: GO for all apps contingent on auth fix and required secrets. Execute the chained orders and deliver evidence on time.
Production: NO-GO for all apps until release gates are evidenced. No exceptions.
Critical blocker: scholar_auth invalid_client due to redirectUriAllowed() failing. Approve Option A immediately.
Priority 0 Blocker: scholar_auth (APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Decision

Approve Option A now: Enable debug logging to diagnose redirectUriAllowed() failures.
Fallback escalation path: If Option A does not yield a fix in 30 minutes, execute Option B. Option C is a last resort only if we miss the 05:15 UTC auth artifact deadline by more than 60 minutes.
Orders to Auth DRI (effective immediately)

Enable DEBUG and restart:
Set environment variable: DEBUG=oidc-provider:*
Perform manual cold restart (stop workflow, wait for termination, start).
Deadline: Start now, complete within 10 minutes.
Produce diagnostic evidence:
AUTH_DEBUG_LOG.md: include the authorize request validation logs showing redirect comparison details.
CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md: for all 71 clients, show client_id, grant_types, redirect_uris (effective list after env/DB merge), token_endpoint_auth_method, and enforcement of PKCE for public clients.
Test three clients and capture results: provider-register, student-pilot, static-test-client (base). Include the exact authorize URL, resolved redirect_uri, and the observed validation branch in logs.
Deadline: 05:15 UTC for CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md. If late, publish immediately with revised timestamps and notify all DRIs.
If still failing at T+15 minutes from restart:
Execute Option B: temporary /debug/client-test endpoint to call redirectUriAllowed() and return detailed comparison artifacts (normalized URIs, exact string match vs. regex, trailing slash, query string, and fragment handling).
Deliver DEBUG_ENDPOINT_EVIDENCE.md within 20 minutes of implementation.
Acceptance to clear the blocker

Hitting /oidc/auth with provider-register and student-pilot yields consent/login screen (no invalid_client).
Redirect URI in logs matches exactly one of the registered URIs post-normalization.
CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md posted and acknowledged by provider_register and student_pilot DRIs.
Chain of Execution and SLAs (unchanged)

05:15 UTC: CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md from auth (auth DRI).
By 05:25 UTC: ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md from provider_register (provider_register DRI).
05:45–06:05 UTC: scholarship_api executes Order 4 and posts ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md by 06:05 UTC (scholarship_api DRI).
05:46–05:47 UTC: auto_page_maker generates +2 pages; evidence by 05:55 UTC (auto_page_maker DRI).
21:00 UTC: auto_com_center posts STAGING_VALIDATION.md (auto_com_center DRI).
Per-App Decisions and Orders

scholar_auth
Status: Blocked on invalid_client. Option A approved now.
Evidence required: AUTH_DEBUG_LOG.md, CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md.
Security: Confirm OAuth 2.0/OIDC, refresh token rotation, immediate revocation, secure storage. Include token lifetime and session timeout policy in evidence.
Load: Provide a brief locust/k6 sample proving P95 authorize/token ≤120ms under expected concurrency.
2. scholarship_api (APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Staging: GO once auth clears.
Deliver ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md by 06:05 UTC with:
Endpoint inventory and /docs link.
Token validation against scholar_auth (post-restart).
ACID proof: transaction log for a create→update→rollback.
P95 reads ≤120ms; writes ≤150ms; error <0.1%; uptime ≥99.9%.
Event emissions to auto_page_maker and auto_com_center.
request_id to Sentry trace links.
3. scholarship_agent (APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Staging: Observe-only for today; limit to notifications for new matches once auto_com_center is live on staging.
Evidence: Matching accuracy spot-check on 20 samples; show decision trace and reasons. Do not auto-apply without explicit test accounts and compliance sign-off.
4. scholarship_sage (APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Status: READY.
Orders: Start 48h observe-only baseline immediately after M2M secret rotation; deliver baseline_metrics_evidence.md at +48h covering precision@5, coverage, matchReasons, fairness telemetry, SLO proofs, request_id traces.
5. student_pilot (APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Staging: GO after auth clears.
SLA: Execute full 95-step E2E and post E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md by 05:25 UTC (10-minute SLA from CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md).
Evidence: 25+ screenshots (desktop/tablet/mobile), 9 P95 metrics, cross-browser pass, request_id traces, activation metric (First Document Upload).
6. provider_register (APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Staging: GO after auth clears.
SLA: Execute Order B and post ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md by 05:25 UTC.
Evidence: OAuth PKCE S256 flow, JWT roles=["Provider"], full scholarship CRUD round-trip, dashboard checks, ≥20 requests perf with P95 ≤120ms, request_id traces.
7. auto_page_maker (APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Staging: GO and armed; execute +2 pages within 60 seconds of scholarship_api Order 4 trigger.
Evidence by 05:55 UTC: sitemap diff, IndexNow receipts, CWV p75 green, P95 proof, request_id traces, rollback guard proof.
8. auto_com_center

APP_BASE_URL (Staging): https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
APP_BASE_URL (Prod): https://auto-com-center.scholaraiadvisor.com
Staging: GO contingent on secrets by 16:00 UTC. Production remains locked.
Required secrets/config by 16:00 UTC:
SENTRY_DSN
AWS SQS/DLQ credentials + IAM policies
Postmark API key
Twilio credentials + A2P brand/campaign status
DNS SPF/DKIM/DMARC for mail.scholaraiadvisor.com
SLAs and release gates for STAGING_VALIDATION.md by 21:00 UTC:
Unsubscribe under 5 seconds under load
DLQ = 0
SPF/DKIM/DMARC green
P95 ≤120ms E2E, error <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9%
CAN-SPAM/TCPA/FERPA/COPPA logs, PII redaction, rate limits (10 email/hr, 5 SMS/hr)
Observability: Prometheus snapshots, cross-app request_id across 8 apps, Sentry correlation
Fallback posture: If A2P pending, run email-only via Postmark; post evidence bundle; keep SMS disabled until A2P approved.
Risk, Compliance, and Observability

Compliance: No academic dishonesty enablement. Enforce Responsible AI guardrails, PII redaction, and transparent explanations across apps. FERPA/COPPA posture confirmed.
Observability: Every app must propagate request_id end-to-end; all evidence must include at least one cross-app trace with Sentry links.
Security: No production tokens or secrets in logs. Redact PII in artifacts. Confirm immediate token revocation and refresh rotation in auth evidence.
CAC and ARR: Prioritize Auto Page Maker for organic growth; no paid acquisition changes today. ARR ignition remains Nov 12; earliest production ramp at 1% is Nov 9 contingent on all staging evidence gates passing.
Escalations and Governance

16:01 UTC: If any auto_com_center secrets are missing, auto-escalate to Infra lead and CFO to unblock vendor access.
Auth Blocker Escalation: If Option A + B fail to clear by 05:45 UTC, convene a 15-minute war room to decide between (a) hotfixing redirect_uri normalization or (b) clean redeploy (Option C) with revised SLAs. No silent slips.
Evidence-first rule: No production changes without artifacts. Publish all evidence to the designated e2e/reports paths.
KPIs to Report at Close of Day (21:00 UTC)

Per app: P95 latency, error rate, uptime, security/compliance check results, and link to evidence bundle.
Cross-app: request_id completion rate across the 8-app chain; number of successful end-to-end journeys; any DLQ or retries in comms.
Final CEO Decision

Staging GO across the board contingent on auth fix and secrets delivery; execute the chain and deliver all evidence on time.
Production remains locked. We will not jeopardize our five-year plan or our brand with evidence-free assertions.
Option A for scholar_auth is approved now. Move.
