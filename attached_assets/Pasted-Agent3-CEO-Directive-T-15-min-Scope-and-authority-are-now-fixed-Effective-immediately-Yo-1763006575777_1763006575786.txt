Agent3 — CEO Directive (T+15 min)

Scope and authority are now fixed. Effective immediately:

Your sole application ownership (DRI):

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Authority: Full for this app only (code, config, publish, go/no-go within CEO guardrails)
All other apps: External services. You may monitor publicly exposed health/metrics only. You have zero authority to publish, modify, or make go-live claims for them.
Answer to your question

Do both: A) Submit one comprehensive status package for auto_com_center only. B) Continue external monitoring of the other 7 apps, clearly labeled “External Service Status – Informational Only, No Authority.”
Non-negotiable guardrails (portfolio-wide)

No GO-LIVE claims unless verified on the published URL with: health proof, publish timestamp/snapshot ID, performance against published URL, and audit evidence. Workspace-only results are insufficient.
auto_com_center must meet P95 ≤120ms before any production send/dispatch is authorized. Until then: Observer/Queue-Dry-Run only.
Immediate proof-of-control (due in 15 minutes)

Create at the published app a well-known text file: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/ceo.txt
File contents (exact): ceo_nonce=acc-2025-11-13-7c9e1f11
Reply back with confirmation and a direct link.
Status package for auto_com_center (due in 2 hours)
Use this exact header and structure:

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY or DELAYED
Evidence links (must be from the published URL; no workspace-only):
Security & Compliance: MFA/SSO integration with scholar_auth, RBAC matrix, TLS, secrets handling, audit logging sample with request_id lineage, FERPA/COPPA posture
Performance: Last 24h P95, P99, throughput, error rate tested against the published URL; load test method and artifacts; evidence P95 ≤120ms or remediation plan
Integration: Contract and successful calls with scholarship_agent (observer) and any mail/SMS providers; failure handling and retries; idempotency safeguards
Reliability & DR: Health checks, alerts, rollback plan, backups, disaster recovery test results
Code/Deployment: Last publish timestamp, snapshot/build ID, commit hash; blue/green or rollback procedure tested
Testing: Unit/integration/end-to-end coverage summary; UAT signoff
Operational Runbook: On-call, SLOs, escalation policy, error budgets
If Status = DELAYED:
Blockers: precise gaps mapped to Section IV
Estimated Go-Live Date/Time (UTC)
ARR ignition date and dependencies
Third-party dependencies and current integration status
Performance remediation plan (start now; include in status package)

14-day plan to achieve and sustain P95 ≤120ms
Daily P95/P99 targets, owners, and measures (micro-caching, connection pooling, projection endpoints, N+1 elimination, queueing, backpressure, CDN headers if applicable)
Guardrails: auto-rollback triggers at P95 >250ms for 10 min or error rate >1% for 5 min on published instance
External Service Status (informational only; due alongside your package)

One page with each app’s APP_BASE_URL, current health endpoint result, basic latency from your vantage point, last-seen timestamp. Label clearly as “External Service Status – Informational Only, No Authority.”
Portfolio decisions you must align to (for awareness; do not execute changes outside your app)

scholarship_api: Proceed with conditional retest only; production traffic is blocked until Redis-backed replay/idempotency is delivered. Decision = Option B.
provider_register: No GA until P0 security fixes are validated on the published URL. The DRI must publish and re-test; your role is monitor-only.
scholarship_agent: Observer mode only until auto_com_center meets P95 ≤120ms and Legal consent checks are fully cleared.
student_pilot: Legal hold remains; monitor-only.
scholar_auth and scholarship_sage: Their DRIs must deliver their own status packages; you provide external status only.
Compliance and Responsible AI

Reaffirm that auto_com_center does not enable any action that could violate consent, FERPA/COPPA, or CAN-SPAM/CASL/GDPR. Include consent lineage and suppression handling in your evidence.
Accountability

Prior CEO-formatted packages you produced for other apps are now formally designated informational only and non-authoritative.
Future claims without published-instance evidence will be rejected.
Execute:

T+15 min: Post ceo_nonce file and confirm link.
T+2 hours: Submit the auto_com_center status package (and the External Service Status page).
EOD: If DELAYED, include a signed remediation timeline and daily reporting cadence.
I will review your ceo_nonce link and the status package on receipt and then authorize next steps.
