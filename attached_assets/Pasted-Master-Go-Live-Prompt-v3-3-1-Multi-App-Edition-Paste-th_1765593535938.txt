Master Go‑Live Prompt v3.3.1 — Multi‑App Edition
Paste this prompt into the scholarship_agent (A3) project only. Every other app must ignore all instructions except the “Not Your App” rule below.

Not Your App rule

Before doing anything, each runtime must identify itself. If your app_id is not A3 (scholarship_agent), do nothing. Emit a NOTICE to your logs that this prompt is scoped to A3 and exit without any changes.
App identity and base URLs

A1 scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A2 scholarship_api → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A3 scholarship_agent → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A4 scholarship_sage → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

A8 auto_com_center (Command Center) → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Universal protocol and telemetry (applies to everyone, but A3 must enforce for its own events)

Protocol version: v3.3.1
Primary ingest endpoint: A8 POST /ingest (alias: POST /api/ingest)
Required headers on every outbound event:
x-scholar-protocol: v3.3.1

SLO expectations (all apps):
Uptime ≥ 99.9%, P95 latency ~120ms
HEARTBEAT every 60s includes uptime_s, queue_depth, error_count_5m, p95_ms_5m

Fallback telemetry:
Primary: A8 /ingest
If A8 fails (non-2xx or timeout), buffer and retry with backoff; optionally send to A2’s ingest if configured as fallback.
Section A3 only — scholarship_agent go‑live plan
A3 must perform all steps in this Section. Other sections are informational and must be ignored by A3.

A3.0 Identify and announce

Determine app_id and base URL at runtime.
Immediately emit APP_IDENTITY with:
app_id: "A3"
app_name: "scholarship_agent"
app_base_url: "https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app"
role: "growth_orchestrator"
version: the running version string
readiness: { ready: false, reason: "preflight" }
A3.1 Preflight checks (blocker if failing)

Dependencies to probe in parallel:
A1, A2, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8
Emit PREFLIGHT_CHECK with:
status_matrix:
"A1 scholar_auth https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app": {status, latency_ms}
"A2 scholarship_api https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app": {status, latency_ms}
"A4 scholarship_sage https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app": {status, latency_ms}
"A5 student_pilot https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app": {status, latency_ms}
"A6 provider_register https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app": {status, latency_ms}
"A7 auto_page_maker https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app": {status, latency_ms}
"A8 auto_com_center https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app": {status, latency_ms}
A3 readiness rule:
Proceed only if A8 ingest is up AND at least A6 and A7 are up. If not, retry 3x with backoff, then emit ERROR_EVENT and pause.
A3.2 Online announcement

When preflight passes, emit APP_ONLINE:
readiness: { ready: true, role: "growth_orchestrator" }
routes_enabled: ["lead_b2c","lead_b2b","seo","campaigns"]
A3.3 Lead generation strategy (immediate launch)

B2C engine (students)
Coordinate with A7 to publish at least 10 SEO landing pages targeting high-intent queries (“no essay scholarships”, “first-gen grants”, “STEM scholarships by state”, etc.).
For each published page, A3 must emit SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED and create a CTA funnel:
CTA_EMITTED for every “Apply Now”, “Check Eligibility”, “Get Matches” rendered.
UTM_ROUTED when incoming traffic has utm_source/medium/campaign.
When a student submits email or begins onboarding (via A5), emit:
LEAD_STUDENT with consent_version, source_page, utm, target_app: "A5".
LEAD_ATTRIBUTION connecting the lead to the SEO page and campaign.
B2B engine (providers)
Outreach wave 1: 50 providers from A2 directory or curated list.
For each attempt, emit PROVIDER_OUTREACH with channel, attempt_count, and handoff fields.
When a provider completes the form at A6, emit PROVIDER_ONBOARDED with provider_id if available. If A3 programmatically initiates a lead on A6:
POST to A6 /api/providers/register using service headers.
On success, emit PROVIDER_CONTACTED and PROVIDER_ONBOARDED.
Campaigns
Emit CAMPAIGN_STARTED for “SEO Bootstrap v1”, “Provider Wave 1”, and “Welcome Drip v1”.
Emit CAMPAIGN_LAUNCHED when creatives/flows are live.
Emit CAMPAIGN_RESULT at end of first 24h and at 7d with metrics.
A3.4 Event payloads A3 must send (include app_label on every event)

APP_IDENTITY / APP_ONLINE
role, version, readiness, environment
PREFLIGHT_CHECK
status_matrix per “A3.1”
HEARTBEAT (every 60s)
uptime_s, queue_depth, error_count_5m, p95_ms_5m
KPI_SNAPSHOT (every 5m)
tiles:
b2c_funnel: impressions, clicks, cta, leads, conversion_rate
b2b_funnel: outreach_count, responses, onboarded, conversion_rate
traffic: sessions, bounce_rate, top_pages
growth: active_campaigns, cost_to_date, cac_estimate
LEAD_STUDENT
student_id (if known), email_hash, consent_version, source_page, utm, target_app: "A5"
LEAD_ATTRIBUTION
lead_id or email_hash, source_app: "A3", campaign, page_url, utm, next_steps: ["route_to_A5","send_welcome_drip"]
PROVIDER_OUTREACH / PROVIDER_CONTACTED / PROVIDER_ONBOARDED
provider fields: name, email_domain, website, type
attempt_count, channel, handoff: { to_app: "A6", method: "api"|"form" }
PAGE_PUBLISHED / SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED (from A7 handoff result)
page_url, keyword, intent, status
CTA_EMITTED / UTM_ROUTED
cta_id, page_url, variant, utm, session_id
CAMPAIGN_STARTED / CAMPAIGN_LAUNCHED / CAMPAIGN_RESULT
campaign_id, name, objective, budget (if any), kpis, results
ERROR_EVENT
severity, code, message, context, last_action
A3.5 Service-to-service conventions (critical for A6/A7)

Always include:
x-scholar-protocol: v3.3.1
x-app-label: "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app"
A6 inter-service registration
Endpoint: A6 POST /api/providers/register
If CSRF/session required, include service headers; retry with backoff if 403; log ERROR_EVENT on persistent failure.
A7 page publishing
Endpoint: A7 POST /api/pages/publish (or current publish route)
Include keyword, title, meta_description, CTA config, target_slug; confirm 200 OK then emit SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED.
A3.6 Frontend display guarantee

All events must include app_label so A8 can render the app badge on tiles: "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app".
Ensure event_type values exactly match the mapping list so A8 routes to the correct widgets.
A3.7 Initial execution steps (run now)

Step 1: APP_IDENTITY and PREFLIGHT_CHECK.
Step 2: APP_ONLINE on success.
Step 3: Launch “SEO Bootstrap v1”:
Request 10 pages from A7 with intents:
“no essay scholarships”
“first-gen college scholarships”
“state scholarships [top 5 states by volume]”
“STEM scholarships for women”
“need-based vs merit-based scholarships”
For each page: confirm publish → emit SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED and CTA_EMITTED per CTA block (“Check Eligibility”).
Step 4: Launch “Welcome Drip v1” for new leads; emit CAMPAIGN_STARTED/LAUNCHED.
Step 5: Provider “Wave 1” outreach to 50 foundations; emit PROVIDER_OUTREACH and on responses PROVIDER_CONTACTED and PROVIDER_ONBOARDED.
Step 6: Begin HEARTBEAT and KPI_SNAPSHOT schedule.
Step 7: After 24h, emit CAMPAIGN_RESULT for all active campaigns.
A3.8 KPIs to track and report (for Command Center)

B2C: leads/day, CTR, CVR, CPA (target organic CAC → $0–$2), ARPU from credits.
B2B: providers onboarded/day, outreach→response→onboarded conversion.
Traffic: organic sessions from A7 pages, top 10 URLs, UTM mix.
Reliability: uptime, P95 latency, error_count_5m.
A3.9 Error handling and retries

Any non-2xx on A8 ingest: queue event, exponential backoff (e.g., 1s/5s/15s/60s), max 10 attempts, then persist to dead-letter and emit ERROR_EVENT with summary counts.
Any dependency down in PREFLIGHT_CHECK: retry 3x, then pause and emit ERROR_EVENT with dependency status_matrix.
All errors include app_label and last_action fields.
A3.10 Compliance and ethics

Never auto-apply on behalf of students; only guide and assist.
Include consent_version on LEAD_STUDENT.
Honor opt-outs immediately; stop nurture sequences and emit KPI_SNAPSHOT noting updated counts.
Section A1 guidance (ignore unless you are A1)

Emit LEAD_STUDENT on signup with consent_version; target_app="A5".
HEARTBEAT and KPI_SNAPSHOT with SLO tiles.
Fallback telemetry to A8, then A2 if configured.
Section A2 guidance (ignore unless you are A2)

Accept v3.3.1 headers on /telemetry/ingest as fallback sink.
Store and forward to A8 when available; maintain idempotency via x-event-id.
Section A4 guidance (ignore unless you are A4)

Emit REC_DELIVERED with scholarship_ids, ranks, rec_count.
KPI_SNAPSHOT into b2c_funnel; include bias_check_performed.
Section A5 guidance (ignore unless you are A5)

Accept LEAD_STUDENT and LEAD_ATTRIBUTION; start onboarding flow.
Emit CTA_EMITTED on in-app CTAs; emit KPI_SNAPSHOT for onboarding progression.
Section A6 guidance (ignore unless you are A6)

Ensure /api/providers/register supports inter-service calls with v3.3.1 headers.
Emit PROVIDER_ONBOARDED on success; include provider_id and app_label.
Section A7 guidance (ignore unless you are A7)

Publish pages on request; emit SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED with keyword, page_url.
Provide page telemetry to A8: impressions, clicks, ctr.
Section A8 guidance (ignore unless you are A8)

Continue ingest on /ingest and /api/ingest.
Display app_label on all tiles; ensure mappings above are active.
Success criteria (what “GO LIVE” means for A3)

Within 60 minutes of launch:
≥10 SEO pages live with SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED events.
≥30 CTAs emitted; ≥15 UTM_ROUTED recorded.
≥25 LEAD_STUDENT and matching LEAD_ATTRIBUTION events delivered to A8.
Provider Wave 1 sent to 50 targets; ≥5 PROVIDER_CONTACTED, ≥2 PROVIDER_ONBOARDED.
HEARTBEAT and KPI_SNAPSHOT visible in A8 with correct app_label.
Stop conditions and rollback

If PREFLIGHT_CHECK degrades for A8 or both A6 and A7 simultaneously:
Pause campaigns, emit ERROR_EVENT, set readiness.ready=false in next HEARTBEAT.
Resume automatically when preflight returns to GREEN.
Final reminder to all apps

App must identify itself before any action.
If not your app, do nothing except emit one NOTICE in logs: “This prompt is scoped to A3 (scholarship_agent). No changes applied.”
On every report and event, include your app_label in both headers and body exactly as: "Ax app_name APP_BASE_URL". Example for A3: "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app".
End of prompt.
