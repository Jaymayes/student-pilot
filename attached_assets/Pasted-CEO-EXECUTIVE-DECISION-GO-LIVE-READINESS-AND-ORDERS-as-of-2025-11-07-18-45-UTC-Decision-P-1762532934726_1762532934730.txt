CEO EXECUTIVE DECISION — GO-LIVE READINESS AND ORDERS (as of 2025-11-07 ~18:45 UTC)

Decision

Proceed with Option A: Execute auth latency mitigation immediately and permit a schedule slip up to 00:15 UTC if P95 ≤120ms is not met by 23:45 UTC. If still >120ms by 00:15 UTC, NO-GO and reschedule +24h with a postmortem delivered by 02:00 UTC.
Authorize pre-warming and the creation of AUTH_FIXLOG now. Engage an auth SME in parallel for a 30-minute pair-debug window (no dependency on this aid to proceed, but permitted to accelerate).
Cross-system Go/No-Go Gates

Auth P95 across authorize, token, jwks, and discovery ≤120ms with error rate ≤1% for 10 consecutive minutes.
invalid_client eliminated for student_pilot, provider_register, and scholarship_sage.
Successful PKCE S256 proof on student_pilot and provider_register; successful M2M (client_credentials) on scholarship_sage with scope enforcement.
JWKS rotation rehearsal completes with zero validation errors.
scholarship_api validation continuity throughout.
War-Room Cadence (UTC)

19:15 pre-smoke, 20:00 open, 30-minute checkpoints, 23:30–23:45 JWKS rehearsal, 00:00 auth gate, 00:30 E2E student_pilot evidence, 01:00 provider_register ORDER_B, 01:30 scholarship_api ORDER_4 addendum.
ARR ignition targets if AUTH GREEN TAG achieved tonight

B2C upsell experiences: +48h after AUTH GREEN TAG (earliest: 2025-11-10 00:00 UTC).
B2B 3% provider fee: upon provider_register ORDER_B completion and first provider activation (earliest: 2025-11-08 01:30–03:00 UTC window).
Per-Application Readiness, Orders, and Dates

Application Name: scholar_auth APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: YELLOW. P95 ~200ms vs ≤120ms target; invalid_client for student_pilot and provider_register; M2M client for scholarship_sage not provisioned.
Orders (start now):
Register clients: student-pilot (auth code + refresh, PKCE S256), provider-register (auth code + refresh, PKCE S256), scholarship_sage (client_credentials, read-only scopes). Ensure correct redirect_uris for prod and current dev URLs; token_endpoint_auth_method client_secret_post or basic; S256 supported.
Enable/verify caching: discovery and JWKS (300s TTL), guard for fast key rollover; add in-memory cache and, if available, edge cache.
Pre-warm authorize and token endpoints at 30–50 RPS for 10 minutes; run in 20-minute intervals until P95 stabilizes ≤120ms.
Connection pooling and keep-alive tuning; ensure JSON serialization optimized; gzip/brotli enabled; avoid DB hits on hot path (client lookup cache).
Instrument request_id and per-endpoint P50/P95 reporting; publish metrics every 20 minutes to war-room.
Estimated Go-Live: 2025-11-08 00:00 UTC if P95 ≤120ms; slip allowed to 00:15 UTC; else NO-GO +24h.
ARR Ignition: Enables B2C +48h; enables B2B immediately after provider_register ORDER_B.

APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: RED → At Risk. invalid_client at auth; latest measured OAuth latency ~136ms (above threshold) prior to optimizations; protected-route redirect logic and PKCE S256 setup appear correct pending client registration fix.
Orders: After auth client registration, re-run PKCE S256 flow; capture protected-route redirect evidence; target P95 ≤120ms; ensure responsive layout validated across Chrome, Safari, Firefox, iOS/Android. Post E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE by 00:30–00:45 UTC if auth GREEN at 00:00–00:15.

Third-Party Systems: SendGrid – Complete; Twilio (if SMS) – In Progress/Confirm; SMTP (fallback) – Standby.
Immediate Actions and Owners (start now)

Auth DRI: Execute client registration, caching, pre-warming, and connection tuning; post P50/P95 metrics at 19:00, 19:20, 19:40, 20:00 UTC and every 20 minutes thereafter. Produce AUTH_FIXLOG by 00:00 UTC.
Student DRI: Prepare to re-run OAuth PKCE tests as soon as auth signals GREEN; assemble E2E evidence by 00:30–00:45.
Provider DRI: Ready to execute ORDER_B within 30–60 minutes of auth GREEN; evidence by ~01:00.
Sage DRI: Execute M2M 3-grant sequence and evidence within 30 minutes of auth GREEN.
API DRI: Monitor validation, collect cross-app traces, and deliver ORDER_4 addendum by ~01:30.
Comms DRI: Confirm production deliverability; publish snapshot at 00:00 and watch spam/complaints.
Incident Commander: Enforce gates, timing, and escalation. If auth P95 >120ms persists at 23:45 UTC, authorize up to 30-minute slip; at 00:15 UTC, call NO-GO.
Answer to Agent3

Proceed with pre-warming now and produce AUTH_FIXLOG. Maintain metrics cadence every 20 minutes. Coordinate DRIs per above and be ready to validate evidence packages on receipt. If any gate risks trend red before 23:45 UTC, escalate immediately with a concrete rollback or NO-GO recommendation.
CEO note

We will not trade long-term trust and SLOs for a hasty launch. If the P95 target is not met by the slip window, we will NO-GO and protect student/provider experience and our error budget. The organic growth engine (auto_page_maker) remains healthy; ARR ignition remains intact with a ≤24h delay if necessary. Act with urgency, but protect quality and security.
