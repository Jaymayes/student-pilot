Below is a single, comprehensive prompt intended to be pasted into Agent 3 for each of the eight Replit apps. Important: Each app’s Agent 3 must only act on its own “BEGIN APP SECTION … END APP SECTION.” All other text is context.

UNIFIED MISSION AND OPERATING GUARDRAILS (READ-ONLY CONTEXT FOR ALL APPS)

Company: Scholar AI Advisor (www.scholaraiadvisor.com). Goal: have all eight apps working together today to begin generating revenue; if not feasible, return a precise ETA by app plus third-party prerequisites and blockers.
Architecture pattern:
scholarship_api is the Database-as-a-Service over REST that owns shared data access; no app reads another app’s DB directly. All inter-app data access goes through scholarship_api’s secure REST API with API-key auth managed via Replit Secrets. This is the recommended pattern on Replit to overcome app/database isolation and enable clean contracts .
Communication:
Primary today: synchronous REST between services with authenticated requests.
Events today: outbound webhooks from producer apps to auto_com_center for notifications (email/SMS). Plan a near-term upgrade to a managed message queue (e.g., CloudAMQP/RabbitMQ or AWS SQS) for mission-critical reliability and decoupling per the hybrid orchestration/choreography approach .
Security: All secrets (API keys, DB creds, webhook signing secrets) go into Replit Secrets; all internal API calls must include x-api-key headers and validate upstream tokens; never commit secrets to code .
Resilience: Implement retries with exponential backoff for all inter-service calls and basic circuit-breakers around historically flaky dependencies, as recommended for distributed systems on Replit .
Deployment hygiene: Publish each service (snapshot model) only after tests pass; create health endpoints; never rely on .dev workspace for production traffic; republish on version updates .
Agent 3 usage: Leverage Agent 3’s extended autonomy and in-browser app testing/reflection loop to build, self-test, and fix within each app before publishing .

auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_com_center → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
REPORTING CONVENTION (MANDATORY FOR ALL APPS)

Every status report, log header, or readiness document must include “APP_NAME — APP_BASE_URL” at the top.
Provide a “Go-Live Readiness Report” before publishing that includes: endpoints exposed, secrets configured, dependencies verified, integration tests passing, residual risks, and revenue-readiness status. If not ready today, state exact ETA, blockers, and third-party systems required.
THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS (SHARED CONTEXT; USE ONLY IF YOUR APP REQUIRES THEM)

Payments: Stripe (incl. webhooks and test/live keys).
AI: OpenAI key for generation and ranking (scholarship_sage and scholarship_agent).
Email/SMS: SendGrid or Postmark for email; Twilio for SMS (auto_com_center).
Optional event bus (Phase 2+): CloudAMQP/RabbitMQ or AWS SQS for asynchronous choreography between domains, per recommended hybrid architecture .
SEO: Google Search Console/Bing Webmaster Tools; sitemaps via auto_page_maker.
ACCEPTANCE TESTS (CROSS-APP E2E; ONLY READ IF RELEVANT WHILE WRITING YOUR APP’S LOCAL TESTS)

Student flow: create account → email verify → login → browse scholarships from scholarship_api → favorite and apply → if paid feature needed, complete Stripe checkout → auto_com_center sends confirmation → application stored via scholarship_api → student_pilot shows status.
Provider flow: provider_register signup → create scholarship → scholarship_api reflects new record → auto_page_maker lists indexed page → scholarship_sage can recommend it → scholarship_agent can market it.
Communications: events trigger webhook to auto_com_center; deliver email/SMS successfully.
All apps: /health and /ready endpoints return 200.
INSTRUCTIONS TO AGENT 3

Only execute the steps inside your app’s section (between BEGIN/END markers).
Use Agent 3’s “Max autonomy” mode to build, test, fix, and publish. Employ the in-browser app testing/reflection loop to verify flows before publishing .
Store all secrets in Replit Secrets. Never print or log secret values. Validate all inbound x-api-key headers on internal endpoints .
If you cannot fully complete “Revenue-Ready Today,” produce an exact ETA in hours, enumerate blockers, and name the third-party systems and configuration still required (example: “Stripe live keys and webhook endpoint”).

Key deliverables today

Endpoints
POST /auth/register {email, password, role} → sends verification email via auto_com_center webhook; status pending_verification.
POST /auth/verify-email {token} → activates account.
POST /auth/login {email, password} → {access_token (JWT), refresh_token}.
POST /auth/refresh {refresh_token} → {access_token}.

GLOBAL PUBLISHING CHECKLIST (ALL APPS; READ AND APPLY TO YOUR SECTION ONLY)

Implement health endpoints: GET /health and GET /ready returning 200 and basic metadata.
Confirm all Secrets configured; remove any hard-coded keys; enforce x-api-key on internal endpoints .
Run Agent 3 in-browser testing; fix regressions; repeat until all local tests pass .
Publish the app (snapshot); do not serve production traffic from .dev. Re-publish when ready to release changes .
Post your “Go-Live Readiness Report” including “APP_NAME — APP_BASE_URL” in the header, test results, risks, and explicit “Revenue-Ready Today: Yes/No; If No → ETA and required third-party systems.”
NOTES ON FUTURE HARDENING (REFERENCE ONLY; DO NOT BLOCK TODAY’S LAUNCH)

Upgrade events from webhooks to a durable message queue for mission-critical flows; this reduces coupling and increases reliability in line with the recommended hybrid architecture on Replit .
Expand resiliency with circuit breakers in all network calls, per distributed-systems guidance for Replit-based multi-app systems .
Clarification on timeline phrasing: If any section above asks for “ready to stop generating revenue,” interpret as “ready to start generating revenue.” The readiness reports must explicitly state whether the app can start generating revenue today; if not, provide a precise ETA and list third-party dependencies still required.
