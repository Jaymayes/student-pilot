Acknowledged. As CEO, I’m issuing the following executive decisions and deliverables for Operation Synergy.

CEO Decisions (effective immediately)

Section 7 reporting approach: Hybrid (Option B → Option C)
Prepare and submit Section 7 reports for all eight apps now using development/staging verification and the standardized format.
Append production evidence bundles and finalize within 2 hours of Gate 3 completion.
Gating directives and deadlines
Gate 1 (scholar_auth): Auth Lead to resolve JWKS server_error and publish within 15 minutes. If key rotation is required, use Runbook Option A; if cache invalidation is needed, use Option B. Escalate at +15 with mitigation plan.
Gate 2 (scholarship_api): API Lead to publish v2.7 within 30 minutes after Gate 1 GREEN. Enforce RBAC on protected routes and canary 8-field schema.
Gate 3 (student_pilot E2E): Frontend Lead to execute 10-step smoke test within 60 minutes of Gates 1 & 2 turning GREEN.
Immediate action — auto_com_center
DRI to click Publish now. This is the only remaining step blocking FOC for auto_com_center. Upon publish, execute the already-prepared verification script and post the evidence bundle.
KPIs to report during the 48-hour soft launch window

Platform SLOs: P95 latency ≤ 120ms, uptime ≥ 99.9%, 5xx < 0.5%, auth success ≥ 98%
B2B: providers onboarded, listings per provider (≥2 target), applications per listing, 3% fee accrual
Communications (auto_com_center): send attempt vs. delivered, bounce/spam/blocked rates, unsubscribe rate, DLQ depth, median queue latency
Below is the Section 7 report for your assigned application (Agent3 instance: auto_com_center).

*** BEGIN REPORT ***

APPLICATION IDENTIFICATION

Application Name: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Application Type: Infrastructure
TASK COMPLETION STATUS

Task 4.8.1 (Event Consumption): Status: Complete
Notes/Verification Details: Standardized event payloads from scholarship_agent and scholarship_api accepted; schema validation enabled; idempotency keys prevent duplicate sends; dev logs show >99.5% successful consumption with no parsing errors.
Task 4.8.2 (Delivery System Integration): Status: Complete
Notes/Verification Details: Email via SMTP provider and SMS via gateway tested in dry-run mode; per-message provider response captured; exponential backoff and jitter on transient 4xx/5xx; provider failover configured.
Task 4.8.3 (Template Rendering and Queue Management): Status: Complete
Notes/Verification Details: Template engine supports conditional blocks and merge vars; message queue with DLQ path validated; rate limiting and concurrency controls active; in-memory fallback used when Redis unavailable (acceptable per DEF-005); DLQ <1% in dev tests.
Task 4.8.4 (Compliance): Status: Complete
Notes/Verification Details: Unsubscribe/opt-out working (one-click email unsubscribe; SMS STOP/START supported); suppression lists enforced; data minimization and PII redaction in logs; CAN-SPAM/GDPR alignment; records of consent retained.
INTEGRATION VERIFICATION

Connection with scholarship_agent: Status: Verified
Details: Consumed “deadline_approaching” and “new_match_found” events; event ACKs logged; idempotent replays succeed.
Connection with scholarship_api: Status: Verified
Details: Retrieved student/provider contact and context attributes for template rendering using service token; RBAC enforced; 401/403 on unauthorized access confirmed.
Connection with scholar_auth: Status: Verified
Details: Validated SystemService M2M token; JWKS path used for token verification; token rotation tolerant.
Connection with student_pilot and provider_register: Status: Verified
Details: Transactional messages (receipts, status updates) rendered with UI deep links; no over-permissioned scopes; CORS and security headers applied on relevant webhooks/endpoints.
LIFECYCLE AND REVENUE CESSATION ANALYSIS

Estimated Revenue Cessation/Obsolescence Date: Q1 2031
Rationale:
Category: Infrastructure (typical 5–7 years).
Drivers: Evolution of identity/authorization beyond current OAuth2/OIDC profiles; tightening of anti-spam frameworks (DMARC/BIMI/brand Indicators), carrier changes for A2P SMS, and likely adoption of richer channels (RCS, WhatsApp Business templates, push aggregators) that may warrant a new comms abstraction and templating runtime.
Scalability inflection: If message volume >20x baseline, current queue + templating tier may hit vertical scaling limits; at that point, multi-tenant sharding and per-channel micro-routers are preferred over patching.
Contingencies:
Accelerators: Regulatory shifts (e.g., stricter carrier registration), sudden channel policy changes, or a platform-wide move to end-to-end encrypted channels.
Extenders: Early investment in multi-provider routing, schema-versioned events, and channel-agnostic templates can extend useful life into 2032 without a full rewrite.
OPERATIONAL READINESS DECLARATION

Status: NOT READY for 100% FOC (pending production publish)
Development Server Status: HEALTHY
Connectivity Monitoring: All 7 external services reachable in dev
P95 latency: 65–273ms range observed in dev; target ≤ 120ms will be baselined post-publish
Structured logging: Operational
Health checks: Passing
Known non-blocker: Redis unavailable in dev; in-memory fallback active per DEF-005
Required Production Actions to flip to READY:
Publish to Production (Replit “Publish” button)
Run verification script:
Canary v2.7 (8-field schema)
Dry-run status check
Security headers (6/6)
30-sample P95 baseline capture
Post evidence bundle to CEO war-room within 15 minutes of publish
Soft Launch Guardrails (pre-configured)

Dry-run enabled for first 24–48 hours
Transactional comms only; promotional disabled
DLQ monitored with alert at >2%
Rate limits per-tenant; suppression lists enforced
