Acknowledged. Day‑3 pre‑toggle package validated and $1M auto‑toggle executed at 14:00Z.

Executive Decision Block — Day‑3 (Post‑Toggle)

Status

GMV cap: $1,000,000 ACTIVE (soft‑throttle at $800,000).
System posture: GO. No hold conditions present at toggle. Hyper‑spike and parity evidence received.
Orders (next 24 hours)

Guardrails and triggers
Pre‑emptive slow if any critical P95 >300 ms for 5 minutes or compute ratio >1.3× for 10 minutes.
Hold at $1M and page CEO if: backlog >20, Stripe headroom <30% for 10 minutes, parity failure (delta ≠ $0.00), or DLQ >0.
A7 PageMaker
Keep 35‑page bursts. Consider 50‑page pilot only after P95 <250 ms for 24 hours AND compute ≤1.2×. If P95 ≥300 ms for 5 minutes, revert bursts and warm cache/CDN.
Database and capacity
Maintain DB headroom ≥40% during the first 12 hours post‑toggle; add 1 more read replica if headroom trends <35% for 30 minutes.
Track pool saturation and connection churn; publish to dashboard tiles.
Stripe headroom
Warn at 40%; auto‑slow at 30% remaining. Confirm retries and idempotency on provider writes during throttling.
Finance and parity
Hourly parity checks continue; any non‑zero delta → immediate rollback + page. Target realized platform fee ≈ $30k/day at full $1M utilization.
Growth execution
SDR Top‑250 dispatch at cap‑lift: enforce 60/12/4 targets; noon PT and EOD roll‑ups. Expand to Top‑400 tomorrow only if meetings→onboard ≥25% and ops remain green.
A/B Variant B stays at 90/10 for 7 days; promote to 100/0 only if time‑to‑payouts, account‑link ≥99.5%, and critical P95 remain green for the entire period.
SEO: keep internal‑link push; resubmit any “crawled‑not‑indexed” clusters at T+180 and EOD.
KPIs to publish hourly

GMV vs cap and soft‑throttle time
Critical P95s and P99s; A7 P95 window
Stripe headroom, compute ratio, DB headroom
Backlog, DLQ, error rate
Provider activation funnel step CVRs; meetings→onboard CVR
Risk watchlist

Double‑wave traffic (SDR + A/B): watch for P95 slope >0.05x/hour.
DB headroom: if <35% for 30 minutes, scale reads and slow non‑critical queries.
PageMaker: if image/render ops dominate latency, apply asset compression and cache directives immediately.
Strategic next steps

Prepare $2M worksheet (do not toggle): draft criteria mirroring $1M with tighter A7 ≤260 ms and compute ≤1.2×; include cash‑flow and fee projections.
Unit economics: keep >4× AI markup; if compute ratio trends >1.25×, pause non‑revenue AI features until margins recover.
Reporting cadence

T+180: Post‑toggle health snapshot (scorecard, A7 window, Stripe/DB headroom, backlog trend).
Noon PT SDR summary: meetings booked, meetings→onboard, pipeline value.
EOD: Full business readout with GMV/fee, soft‑throttle time, A/B stability, compliance artifacts.
Proceed. Keep me paged on any hold trigger.
