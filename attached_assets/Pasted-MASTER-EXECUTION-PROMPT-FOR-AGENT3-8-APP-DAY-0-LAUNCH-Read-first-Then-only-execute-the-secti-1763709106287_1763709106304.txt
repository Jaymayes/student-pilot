MASTER EXECUTION PROMPT (FOR AGENT3) — 8-APP DAY-0 LAUNCH

Read first. Then only execute the section that matches your assigned app. If you are Agent3, your scope is SECTION-8: auto_com_center. Do not act on any other section.

Operating context

Mission: Get the full 8-app ecosystem production-ready and working together today to begin generating revenue. If “today” is not possible for your app, you must report a precise ETA and list the third-party systems that must be in place before revenue starts.
Reporting rule: Every report you generate must include “App: {APP_NAME}” and “APP_BASE_URL: {APP_BASE_URL}” at the top.
SLOs you must hold: 99.9% uptime and ≤120ms P95 latency for standard requests.
Security/compliance you must verify: RS256 JWT validation (if applicable), least-privilege keys, secure headers, rate limiting, PII handling, and alignment with FERPA/COPPA/GDPR. Uphold Responsible AI (no ghostwriting or academic dishonesty).
Deliverables you must produce (five files per app)

{app}_DAY0_READINESS_REPORT.md
{app}_INTEGRATION_MATRIX.md
{app}_REVENUE_ON_STATEMENT.md
{app}_SECURITY_COMPLIANCE.md
{app}_PERF_SNAPSHOT.json
File rules

Filenames use snake_case and contain no spaces.
Top-of-file lines in all reports:
App: {APP_NAME}
APP_BASE_URL: {APP_BASE_URL}
If your app cannot be 100% ready today, state:
Exact ETA (in hours) to start generating revenue
Items blocking readiness
Third-party systems and credentials required
Risks and mitigation
Global cross-app integration checks (execute only those that touch your app)

Auth: Accept/validate RS256 JWTs from scholar_auth JWKS.
Data flow: scholarship_api serves clean scholarship data to student_pilot and scholarship_sage; auto_page_maker crawls it for SEO; scholarship_agent runs campaigns.
Revenue: provider_register enforces Stripe Connect 3% platform fee; student_pilot enables B2C credit purchases; auto_com_center sends transactional communications.
Observability: /healthz and /readyz respond correctly; logs contain request_id; no PII in logs.
SEO: auto_page_maker exposes sitemap.xml, robots.txt, canonical tags, and schema.org; linked into student_pilot pages.
Agent self-selection rule

You must only execute the section that matches your app.
If you are Agent3, you must execute SECTION-8 only.

SECTION-8 (auto_com_center) — THIS IS YOUR SCOPE IF YOU ARE AGENT3

APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Purpose:
Transactional communications hub (email and message delivery) for the ecosystem
Primary trigger points: student signup confirmations, application status notices, provider onboarding steps, campaign dispatches from scholarship_agent
Required dependencies (must validate end-to-end):
scholar_auth: Validate RS256 JWT on admin/protected endpoints (JWKS URL from scholar_auth)
Neon PostgreSQL: emailAuditLog and unsubscribes tables; indexes on messageId and email
Postmark (or equivalent email API): live send, bounce/complaint/unsubscribe webhooks configured
Third-party systems and keys:
POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN and SENDER_SIGNATURE verified
Postmark webhooks for bounce, complaint, and unsubscribe pointing to:
POST /webhooks/postmark/bounce
POST /webhooks/postmark/complaint
POST /api/unsubscribe (or provider-specific endpoint you expose)
Sentry DSN (optional but recommended)
Must-have endpoints and behavior:
POST /api/send
Validates JWT (admin or service scope)
Checks suppression/unsubscribe before send
Sends via Postmark; writes to emailAuditLog
Returns messageId and provider response
GET /api/messages/:id/status
Returns delivery status using DB state + webhook updates
POST /api/unsubscribe
One-click unsubscribe; idempotent; records email in suppression list
GET /api/suppression-list (admin)
JWT-protected; returns paginated suppressed addresses
GET /healthz and GET /readyz
Healthz: in-memory check
Readyz: DB connectivity, JWKS availability, Postmark reachability
Security and compliance:
JWT: RS256 via scholar_auth JWKS; cache keys locally
Rate limiting on POST /api/send (e.g., 120 rpm per origin or API key)
Security headers via Helmet-equivalent
Data minimization: store only necessary fields; mask PII in logs
CAN-SPAM/GDPR/FERPA/TCPA aligned unsubscribe and consent handling
Performance requirements:
P95 latency ≤120ms on POST /api/send including Postmark call
Connection pooling configured for Postgres; indexes in place
ETag disabled for transactional POSTs; no-cache headers on mutating endpoints
Smoke tests to execute now:
Health:
GET /healthz → 200
GET /readyz → 200 with dependency statuses
Auth:
Call POST /api/send with invalid JWT → 401
Call protected admin endpoint without JWT → 401
Send flow:
POST /api/send with valid JWT and test recipient → 200; messageId returned; DB write present
GET /api/messages/:id/status reflects queued/sent
Unsubscribe:
POST /api/unsubscribe with recipient email → 200; subsequent send blocked
Webhooks:
Simulate Postmark bounce/complaint payload → audit state updated
Integration role (must validate):
Accept dispatch requests from scholarship_agent (test mode or limited live)
Notify student_pilot users for key lifecycle events (signups, confirmations)
Notify provider_register users for onboarding steps and status updates

“If today is not possible” instruction (for this app):
Provide a single-line ETA in hours to start generating revenue and the gating items. Example:
ETA_to_revenue: 4h; Missing: Postmark webhook configuration; Required: POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN, bounce/complaint webhook URLs reachable over HTTPS; Risk: low
Success criteria for GO decision:
All smoke tests pass
JWT validation and suppression logic confirmed
At least one successful live (or sandbox) send recorded and auditable
Unsubscribe recorded and enforced
P95 ≤120ms on POST /api/send with sample payloads
Webhook ingestion verified (simulated or live)
Execution checklist (for your section only)

Confirm environment variables and third-party keys present
Run smoke tests and record transcripts
Validate upstream/downstream integrations
Generate the five deliverables with required headers
Make a clear GO/NO-GO recommendation with rationale
If NO-GO or AMBER, provide ETA to start generating revenue and list blocking third parties/systems
Begin now.
