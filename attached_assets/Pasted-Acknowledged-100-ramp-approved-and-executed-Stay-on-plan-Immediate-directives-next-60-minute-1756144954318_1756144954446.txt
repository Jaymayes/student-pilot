Acknowledged. 100% ramp approved and executed. Stay on plan.

Immediate directives (next 60 minutes)

Post 02:00 and 02:30 UTC snapshots to exec channel:
p95, 5xx, auth FP, reconciliation ($0), PII=0
WAF hits (billing + SQLi), cache hit trend, CWV RUM samples
Synthetic probes (slowest geo/client), error budget burn
Build SHA/digest, feature flags, confirmation merges remain frozen for auth/billing
Controls

Guardrails unchanged: auto-rollback/refreeze on p95 +15%, 5xx +0.5%, any PII violation, or reconciliation delta > $0.
WAF protections and tiered rate limiting remain on.
CI/security gates remain strict. Auth/billing merges stay frozen until AAR; all other deploys behind flags only.
T+24h After-Action Review (17:30 UTC tomorrow)

Deliverables:
Security: PII redaction = 0; auth FP ≤0.5%; artifact/secret scans clean; WAF metrics; incident/runbook updates
Reliability: ≥99.9% uptime; p95 within ±10% baseline; endpoint contract 100%; SSR trend; geo/client outliers
Finance: Reconciliation deltas = $0; idempotency adherence; any dispute/charge anomalies
Process: CI/security gate compliance; hotfix/change log; lessons learned; permanent controls adopted
Follow-ups: Top 5 actions with owners and deadlines (72h and 14-day horizons)
Post-launch hardening (execute within 72 hours, does not block)

Security headers: strict CSP, HSTS (includeSubDomains, preload), Referrer-Policy, X-Frame-Options/Frame-Ancestors, X-Content-Type-Options
JWT key rotation with KID versioning and short TTLs; vault-backed secret rotation policy
DB least-privilege roles (separate read/write); confirm transaction guards on complex writes
Audit log integrity (hash chaining) and retention tiers; finalize/approve the incident runbook you exercised
WAF tuning based on observed hits; maintain billing-path lockdown
Communications and trust

Status page already updated; no further external comms tonight beyond the partner assurance already sent.
Prepare a brief trust update for our Trust/Compliance hub summarizing security hardening and monitoring posture (publish post-AAR).
Transition to Growth Sprint (starts after AAR passes)

Deploy behind flags in this order:
Pricing/onboarding experiments with entitlement checks
Provider Portal MVP slices for pilot partners (target: 20 pilots/LOIs, first GMV processed)
SEO instrumentation and CWV beacons; ramp Auto Page Maker
Daily/weekly KPIs:
North star: successful scholarship submissions per active user (SSPAU)
B2C: organic sessions, free→paid conversion, ARPU, activation, D7 retention
B2B: active providers, GMV, 3% fee revenue, provider NPS
Efficiency/SLOs: CAC trend, CWV pass rate, index coverage, uptime, p95
Escalation

Page the exec channel immediately if any guardrail trips or a must‑pass metric trends toward its threshold. Do not wait for the next checkpoint.
See you at 02:00 UTC with the first post-100% snapshot.
