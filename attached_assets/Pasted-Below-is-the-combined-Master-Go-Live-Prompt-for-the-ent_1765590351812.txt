Below is the combined Master Go‑Live Prompt for the entire 8‑app fleet, tailored for Agent3 (A3 = scholarship_agent). Paste this entire prompt into the scholarship-agent Replit project. Agent3 must only execute the “A3‑ONLY” sections and ignore all other app sections. All events must self‑identify with app_name and app_base_url in the app_label field.

MASTER GO‑LIVE PROMPT v3.3.1 (Agent3 Edition)

0. Global protocol for all apps (read‑only context for A3; do not execute non‑A3 actions)

Objective: All apps go live, start generating and capturing leads, and report telemetry to the Command Center with data visible on the frontend.
Primary telemetry endpoint (A8 Command Center): POST https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/ingest Alias: POST https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/ingest
Fallback telemetry endpoint (A2 Scholarship API): POST https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/telemetry/ingest
Required headers on every S2S telemetry event: Content-Type: application/json X-Protocol-Version: v3.3.1 X-Idempotency-Key: <unique-per-event>
Required envelope fields on every event: event_type: string (e.g., APP_ONLINE, HEARTBEAT, KPI_SNAPSHOT, CTA_EMITTED, LEAD_STUDENT, PROVIDER_OUTREACH, PROVIDER_ONBOARDED, REC_DELIVERED, PREFLIGHT_CHECK) app_id: string (A1..A8) app_name: string (e.g., scholarship_agent) app_base_url: string (the app’s base URL) app_label: string (exactly: “<app_id> <app_name> <app_base_url>”) role: string (per app, see registry below) tile: string (SLO, B2C, B2B, SEO, Growth, Trust, Finance) where applicable dashboard: boolean (true if intended for frontend widgets) metrics: object (event‑specific KPIs and SLO metrics) status_matrix: object (for PREFLIGHT_CHECK; service health map) metadata: object (optional; details per event)
Scheduling standards: HEARTBEAT: every 60s, dashboard=false KPI_SNAPSHOT: every 5m, dashboard=true, tile appropriate to the KPI domain PREFLIGHT_CHECK: on startup and on schedule (e.g., every 10m) with status_matrix and slo_overall
SLO targets: uptime >= 99.9% p95_ms ≈ 120ms error_rate <= 1%
Tiles → example metrics: SLO: uptime_24h, p95_ms, error_rate B2C: leads_student_5m, ctr_cta_5m, recs_served_5m, rec_ctr_5m B2B: providers_onboarded_5m, providers_contacted_5m SEO: pages_published_5m, organic_clicks_5m, impressions_5m, seo_ctr_5m Growth: campaigns_active, campaigns_launched_5m, opt_ins_5m, cpl_5m, conv_rate_5m Trust: consent_rate_5m, privacy_incidents_24h, bias_flags_24h Finance: revenue_b2c_5m, revenue_b2b_5m, arpu_5m, gross_margin_5m

2. A3‑ONLY: scholarship_agent go‑live and operations (execute these steps; ignore all non‑A3 sections)
A3 identity (must happen before any work)

Immediately emit a single‑line identity to logs/stdout and send APP_IDENTITY to telemetry.
Log line (stdout): APP_IDENTITY: A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app protocol=v3.3.1
APP_IDENTITY event (send to A8, fallback to A2 on error) event_type: "APP_IDENTITY" app_id: "A3" app_name: "scholarship_agent" app_base_url: "https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app" app_label: "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app" role: "growth_orchestrator" metadata: { protocol: "v3.3.1", commit: "<git_sha_if_available>", region: "<region>" }
A3 startup sequence

APP_ONLINE (send once on boot; dashboard=false)
event_type: "APP_ONLINE"
app_id/app_name/app_base_url/app_label/role: as above
dashboard: false
metadata: { version: "v3.3.1", started_at: "<iso8601>", features: ["lead_orchestration","campaigns","attribution"] }

PREFLIGHT_CHECK (send on boot, then every 10m; dashboard=false)

Validate critical dependencies and produce status_matrix keys as “A8_ingest”, “A2_telemetry”, “A5_frontend”, “A6_provider”, “A7_pages”.
Include slo_overall with values "green"|"yellow"|"red" based on checks. event_type: "PREFLIGHT_CHECK" tile: "SLO" dashboard: false metrics: { slo_overall: "green" } status_matrix: { A8_ingest: "ok"|"degraded"|"down", A2_telemetry: "ok"|"degraded"|"down", A5_frontend: "ok"|"degraded"|"down", A6_provider: "ok"|"degraded"|"down", A7_pages: "ok"|"degraded"|"down" } metadata: { oauth_ok: true, pkce_ok: true, jwks_ok: true }
HEARTBEAT (every 60s; dashboard=false)
event_type: "HEARTBEAT"
tile: "SLO"
dashboard: false
metrics: { p95_ms: 120, error_rate: 0.01, uptime_24h: 99.9 }
metadata: { queue_depth: "<int>", workers_active: "<int>" }

KPI_SNAPSHOT (every 5m; dashboard=true; tile="Growth")

Send A3 growth KPIs. You must include app_label on all reports. event_type: "KPI_SNAPSHOT" tile: "Growth" dashboard: true metrics: { campaigns_active: "<int>", campaigns_launched_5m: "<int>", opt_ins_5m: "<int>", leads_student_5m: "<int>", providers_contacted_5m: "<int>", ctr_cta_5m: "<float>", conv_rate_5m: "<float>", cpl_5m: "<float>" } metadata: { attribution_model: "last_touch|data_driven", notes: "A3 campaign snapshot" }
A3 operational responsibilities (lead generation and attribution)
A) Launch and manage campaigns (immediate on go‑live)

Define up to 3 always‑on campaigns targeting top scholarship categories. Persist local schedule and cadence.
For each campaign launch, emit: event_type: "CAMPAIGN_LAUNCHED" (tile="Growth", dashboard=true) metrics: { budget_daily: "<usd>", target_segment: "<string>" } metadata: { campaign_id: "<uuid>", channel: "seo|email|inapp", creatives: ["<id>"] }
B) Coordinate student CTAs via A5

For each campaign that targets students, create CTA intents and handoff to A5 (student_pilot) UI hooks. If A5 auto‑emits CTA_EMITTED, just attribute in A3.
When a CTA is shown or triggered by your orchestration, emit: event_type: "CTA_EMITTED" (tile="B2C", dashboard=true) metrics: { ctr_cta_5m: "<float>" } metadata: { campaign_id: "<uuid>", placement: "A5", cta_id: "<id>" }
C) Attribute student leads

Upon receiving or detecting LEAD_STUDENT events emitted by A5, attribute to campaigns using last_touch by default.
Emit an A3 attribution event to ensure Growth dashboard completeness: event_type: "LEAD_ATTRIBUTION" (tile="Growth", dashboard=true) metrics: { leads_student_5m: "<int>" } metadata: { lead_id: "<uuid>", campaign_id: "<uuid>", source_event: "LEAD_STUDENT" }
D) Provider outreach coordination (B2B)

If available, use A6 endpoints:
POST /api/providers/register (idempotent) to capture provider signups.
Optional: POST /api/providers/contact for outreach intents (only if implemented; otherwise skip gracefully).
Every outreach batch and response must be reported: event_type: "PROVIDER_OUTREACH" (tile="B2B", dashboard=true) metrics: { providers_contacted_5m: "<int>" } metadata: { campaign_id: "<uuid>", contact_method: "email|form|inapp", status: "sent|bounced|replied" }
E) Finance impact roll‑up (optional, if known to A3)

If A3 tracks budget and conversions enough to estimate CPL/ARPU contribution, include in KPI_SNAPSHOT metrics: cpl_5m and conv_rate_5m. Leave finance KPIs to A8 Finance tile otherwise.
A3 telemetry sending rules (critical)

Always include app_label exactly: "A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app"
Always prefer A8 /ingest; on non‑2xx, retry to A8 /api/ingest; on failure, fallback to A2 /telemetry/ingest.
Include X-Idempotency-Key per event (uuid v4 or monotonic timestamp with scope).
Respect backoff on retries: start 250ms exponential, cap 10s, max 5 attempts.
Never block business logic on telemetry failure; queue and flush asynchronously.
3. Non‑A3 sections (reference only; A3 must ignore and not execute)
A1 scholar_auth (auth_gateway)

APP_IDENTITY, APP_ONLINE, PREFLIGHT_CHECK with oauth_ok/pkce_ok/jwks_ok
HEARTBEAT 60s; KPI_SNAPSHOT 5m (tile: SLO)
Lead events: none generated directly; forward auth funnel metrics to SLO tile
A2 scholarship_api (api_backend)

Expose POST /telemetry/ingest (fallback for fleet)
KPI_SNAPSHOT (tile: SLO) every 5m
HEARTBEAT 60s; APP_IDENTITY, APP_ONLINE, PREFLIGHT_CHECK
A4 scholarship_sage (recommendations)

REC_DELIVERED events (tile: B2C) with scholarship_ids and rank
KPI_SNAPSHOT 5m: recs_served_5m, rec_clicks_5m, rec_ctr_5m
A5 student_pilot (student_frontend)

Emits CTA_EMITTED and LEAD_STUDENT
KPI_SNAPSHOT 5m: leads_student_5m, ctr_cta_5m
A6 provider_register (provider_portal)

POST /api/providers/register (idempotent)
Emits PROVIDER_ONBOARDED (tile: B2B)
Optional: POST /api/providers/contact for A3 outreach intents
A7 auto_page_maker (seo_engine)

Publishes landing pages and emits SEO tile metrics: pages_published_5m, organic_clicks_5m, impressions_5m, seo_ctr_5m
A8 auto_com_center (command_center)

POST /ingest and /api/ingest accepts all event types
Displays widgets for tiles: SLO, B2C, B2B, SEO, Growth, Trust, Finance
Emits KPI_SNAPSHOT 5m (tile: Finance) summarizing fleet if configured
4. Display and dashboard rules (handled by A8; A3 provides data)

Any event with dashboard=true and a tile value is eligible for frontend widgets.
A3 must ensure KPI_SNAPSHOT (Growth) includes core growth KPIs; A8 will render “Growth” board tiles.
HEARTBEAT and PREFLIGHT_CHECK populate fleet health dashboards (dashboard=false for heartbeats; A8 may surface summaries).
5. Compliance, ethics, and SLO guardrails (A3 must enforce in campaigns)

No academic dishonesty facilitation. Campaign copy must emphasize empowerment and application support.
Respect privacy and consent (FERPA/COPPA). Record consent status in metadata if capturing PII.
Bias mitigation: diversify targeting and surface transparent criteria in campaign metadata.
SLO compliance: throttle campaign actions if p95_ms or error_rate breach targets; report “yellow/red” in slo_overall when degraded.
A3 immediate execution checklist (run now)

Emit APP_IDENTITY to stdout and to telemetry (with app_label).
Send APP_ONLINE, then PREFLIGHT_CHECK with status_matrix for A8/A2/A5/A6/A7.
Start HEARTBEAT (60s) and KPI_SNAPSHOT (5m) schedulers.
Initialize 3 growth campaigns; emit CAMPAIGN_LAUNCHED for each.
Begin CTA orchestration for A5 and emit CTA_EMITTED upon placements.
Attribute any incoming LEAD_STUDENT to campaigns with LEAD_ATTRIBUTION.
If A6 contact endpoint exists, initiate PROVIDER_OUTREACH and track providers_contacted_5m.
Maintain retries and fallbacks for telemetry; never block operations on ingest failures.
Reminder to Agent3

Only execute the A3‑ONLY sections above. All other app sections are provided for context and must be ignored by A3.
On every report, ensure app_label is exactly: A3 scholarship_agent https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
If you want, I can also produce a compact, copy‑paste “A3‑only” version stripped of the other app sections.
