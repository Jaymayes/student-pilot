CEO Decision: Start the 48-hour execution window now. Maintain the gated plan; no live-dollar purchase until all three GO gates are evidenced and approved at T+24. Begin Auto Page Maker expansion immediately.

Why this path

Data-first and risk-managed: We will not rely on unverified assertions. Evidence or it didn’t happen.
Organic-first growth: Auto Page Maker ramps now to compound low-CAC acquisition while teams complete readiness.
Clear accountability: Each app owner delivers a Production Status Report and proof pack for a T+24 GO/NO-GO.
Directive 1: Clock start (effective immediately)

T+0 to T+3 hours
Each app owner acknowledges this directive in the shared channel.
Each app owner posts “I own it” with their app name and ETA to submit their PSR + evidence.
T+24 hours
CEO review of all evidence; formal GO/NO-GO on the live-dollar test.
T+24 to T+48 hours
If GO, execute the $9.99 live-dollar purchase, capture the evidence bundle, and publish KPI baseline.
Directive 2: Auto Page Maker (start now)

Throughput: 200–500 pages/day starting immediately.
Requirements:
Clear “Apply Now” CTA to student_pilot with UTM tracking.
Automatic sitemap.xml updates each batch.
Schema.org structured data on every page, canonical tags, deduplication, internal linking by intent clusters.
No thin or near-duplicate content; enforce quality thresholds.
Daily report to this thread: pages published, indexability status, and top 10 URLs.
Directive 3: Three GO gates (must all be evidenced by T+24)

Gate 1: Payments (provider_register + auto_com_center)
Stripe LIVE mode: sk_live_, pk_live_, whsec_ configured.
Stripe dashboard screenshot showing LIVE webhook endpoint and last delivery 200 OK.
Notification path: payment_intent.succeeded → auto_com_center → receipt sent (evidence of message ID).
Gate 2: Security and performance (scholar_auth + scholarship_api)
Auth:
Issuer and audience documented.
JWKS reachable; validation working.
401 without token, 200 with valid token (curl output and timings).
Performance:
P95 latency ≤120ms for auth verify and scholarship_api hot paths.
Gate 3: CORS (scholarship_api + auto_com_center + all)
Strict allowlist only (no wildcards).
Evidence: show allowed origins and a preflight test from an allowed origin; show a denied origin test.
Directive 4: Owner deliverables (due by T+24)
Each owner must submit two items: 1) Production Status Report with exactly four sections; 2) A screenshot/evidence pack.

Production Status Report format (exactly these four headings):
Current Status: X% complete toward production
Integration Check: Which apps you are successfully connected to
Revenue Readiness: Can we stop coding and start selling today? Yes/No. If No: estimate to MVP (e.g., “4 hours,” “2 days”)
Third-Party Dependencies: List all external keys/systems (e.g., Stripe, OpenAI, SendGrid, DB, auth) and whether each is detected in environment secrets
Evidence pack (minimum set):
Secrets page screenshot (mask actual values) showing required env vars detected.
Health endpoint 200 OK with response time.
Auth tests: 401 without token; 200 with valid token (curl output).
CORS: config snippet or env allowlist; one passing and one failing origin test.
For Payments Lead: Stripe LIVE dashboard screenshots of keys redacted, webhook config, last delivery 200 OK.
For Comms Lead: notification POST test result with provider message ID and timestamp.
For Frontend Lead: browser Network tab showing clean requests to scholarship_api only; no direct DB; Apply flow routes correctly.
Directive 5: Role-specific acceptance criteria

Auth Lead (scholar_auth)
Issuer, audience, JWKS URL published.
P95 ≤120ms for /verify or equivalent token validation path.
No PII in logs; rotation policy documented.
API Lead (scholarship_api)
GET /scholarships (public/filtered) and POST /scholarships (provider-only with scope) functional.
Strict schema validation on Scholarship and User.
401/200 behavior evidenced; CORS allowlist in effect.
P95 ≤120ms on read endpoints; ledger endpoints ready.
Payments Lead (provider_register)
Stripe LIVE keys configured and webhook secret validated.
LIVE webhook delivers 200 OK to our endpoint; screenshot proof.
On successful payment: provider account creation via scholar_auth with provider scope; 3% fee logging prepared.
Comms Lead (auto_com_center)
POST /send-notification standardized, authenticated, and returns message IDs.
At least “Welcome,” “Reset Password,” “New Match Found,” “Payment Receipt” templates installed.
CORS allowlist only; no wildcards.
Frontend Lead (student_pilot)
Application Tracker UI working; profile completion progress bar implemented.
All reads via scholarship_api only.
Apply button routes correctly; browser console and Network tab clean.
Directive 6: Observability and error standards (all apps)

JSON error format: { "status": "error", "source": "[APP_BASE_URL]", "message": "...", "request_id": "..." }
Every request assigns a request_id and logs latency (P50/P95), error rate, and upstream dependency timing.
Security: No PII in logs; secrets never logged; JWTs redacted; rate limits on auth endpoints.
Directive 7: Compliance and Responsible AI

FERPA/COPPA: No under-13 accounts; enforce parental consent where applicable; data minimization and purpose limitation controls.
Responsible AI: No ghostwriting for academic dishonesty; bias mitigation guardrails; advice must be explainable and actionable with direct links when recommending scholarships.
Directive 8: Evidence discipline

Conflicting claims observed (e.g., auth token 500 vs. all green). Treat every claim as unverified until the owner posts the evidence pack. No exceptions.
If an owner cannot meet a gate by T+24, post a rollback/mitigation plan and a concrete ETA.
What I need now

Agent3: Announce “Clock started” in the shared thread and tag each owner with their deliverables and T+24 deadline.
All five owners: Acknowledge ownership and post your PSR + evidence pack before T+24.
Auto Page Maker: Confirm start and post your first daily report within 24 hours.
First-Dollar test policy

We will not execute the live-dollar purchase until T+24 GO approval with complete evidence. After GO, the Frontend Lead will execute the $9.99 purchase during a 30-minute monitored window, with all teams on standby to capture the full evidence bundle and KPI baseline.
Decisions finalized

48-hour execution window: Start now.
Live-dollar timing: Gated at T+24 pending evidence.
Auto Page Maker expansion: Start now at 200–500 pages/day.
Execute.
