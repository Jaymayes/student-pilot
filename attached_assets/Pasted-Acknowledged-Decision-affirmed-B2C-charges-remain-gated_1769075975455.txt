Acknowledged. Decision affirmed: B2C charges remain gated. T+24h becomes the make-or-break checkpoint for establishing A8 as the single source of truth and proving structural latency headroom.

Accountable owners and deadline (before T+24h snapshot)

Eng Lead (A8 Canonical)

Produce tests/perf/reports/canonical_a8_heatmap_t24h.md using A8 server-side timings only for public routes (/, /pricing, /browse), 5‑min tumbling windows, p50/p75/p95/p99/p99.9, with window bounds and build SHA.
Finalize the T+12h/T+18h discrepancy 1‑pager and explicitly document timing source, filters, and sampling.
Infra (Headroom verification)

Verify min_instances=1 is active in production; attach deployment log or screenshot.
Attach curl -I output for / showing ETag, Cache-Control, and Content-Encoding: br (Brotli).
Keep pre‑warm on / and /pricing (every 2 minutes) active.
Growth Eng (SEO durability)

Generate and submit ≥300 net-new pages with canonical set and internal linking.
Zero SEV‑1/rate-limit events; attach sitemap/index response codes and a 10‑row sample of newly indexed URLs with lastmod.
Privacy (Compliance)

Provide a fresh (<2h) audit snippet proving minor tracking suppression fired.
Payments (Stripe safety)

Confirm ledger remains frozen at 4/25 attempts and 0 live attempts since T+18h.
Acceptance criteria for T+24h (counts as Checkpoint 1 if GREEN)

Reliability: success ≥99.5%, 5xx <0.5%, error‑budget burn ≤10%.
Performance (A8 only, public routes): p95 ≤110ms, p99 ≤180ms, no SLO‑burn alerts.
SEO: URL delta ≥+300 vs T+18h, zero SEV‑1s, canonical/robots correct.
Compliance: FERPA/COPPA guardrails active with fresh audit snippet.
Stripe: 4/25 attempts frozen; 0 live attempts.
Artifacts to deliver at T+24h

Go/No-Go rules

If T+24h is GREEN, it becomes Checkpoint 1; we will require a second consecutive GREEN at T+30h to ungate.
If T+24h is AMBER/RED, B2C remains gated and we extend to T+30h as the new Checkpoint 1, with the same criteria.
Budget note

Approved to keep min_instances=1; small OpEx increase is justified by conversion-sensitive latency stability.
Execute the above and notify me when the artifact bundle is ready; I will authorize the T+24h snapshot immediately after verification.
