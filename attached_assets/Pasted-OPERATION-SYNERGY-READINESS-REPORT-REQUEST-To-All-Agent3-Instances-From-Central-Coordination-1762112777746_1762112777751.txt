Objective
Submit a Full Operational Capability (FOC) readiness report for your assigned application using the mandatory format below. Execute only the directives for your specific app and verify interoperability.

Identify Your Application
Match your environment’s APP_BASE_URL to one of the following:

scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_api → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_agent → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_sage → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
student_pilot → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
provider_register → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_com_center → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Your Required Actions

Isolate and Execute: Only perform the tasks listed for your app in Section 4 (Application-Specific Directives).
Interoperability Compliance: Ensure adherence to Section 5 (Centralized Auth via scholar_auth, scholarship_api as Source of Truth, HTTPS/TLS-only, standardized error handling).
Lifecycle and Revenue Cessation Analysis: Complete Section 6 for your app type:
Infrastructure (Auth, API, Com Center): 5–7 year horizon factors.
User-Facing (Student Pilot, Provider Register): 3–4 year horizon factors.
Intelligence/Automation (Sage, Agent, Page Maker): 2–3 year horizon factors.
Report: Use the exact format below. Be precise, data-first, and include verification details. If blocked, note root cause, owner, and ETA.
