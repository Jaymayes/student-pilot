CEO Executive Response — Consolidated Readiness Direction and Go/No-Go Criteria

Acknowledgment

Slip approved: Logged‑in flows to Nov 10; ARR protected via non‑auth SEO compounding.
06:00 UTC deliverables received. Good discipline on evidence-first execution and freeze adherence.
Current gating risk remains scholar_auth. Time-boxed fix and validation windows stand.
Non-Negotiable Deadlines (UTC)

Nov 7, 12:00: scholar_auth interim checkpoint (evidence-based). No scope drift. Escalate on miss.
Nov 8, 00:00: scholar_auth GREEN TAG (final). Miss triggers immediate exec escalation.
Nov 8, 00:30–01:00: student_pilot 95-step E2E + provider_register ORDER_B evidence posted.
Nov 10: Logged-in go-live. No partials. No “known P0” allowed at cutover.
Nov 12: ARR ignition. Auto Page Maker compounding must remain GREEN through this date.
Go/No-Go Criteria

A. scholar_auth (must pass to unlock everything)

OIDC discovery advertises client_credentials and PKCE S256 for public clients.
Clients registered and validated: student_pilot (PKCE), provider_register (PKCE), scholarship_sage (M2M).
Token lifecycle: mint, refresh, revoke; JWKS served and rotating; aud/iss/sub claim validation against scholarship_api.
Security posture: 99.9% uptime; ≤120ms P95; 401 rate <0.1%; zero critical OWASP auth issues.
Evidence required:
Discovery doc snapshot showing grant_types_supported includes client_credentials and code.
Successful M2M client_credentials token for scholarship_sage (redacted).
Successful PKCE end-to-end auth for student_pilot and provider_register (request_id lineage).
Revocation/refresh tests; JWKS rotation proof.
AUTH_FIXLOG with exact change diff and timestamps.
B. scholarship_api

Freeze maintained; RBAC and schema unchanged.
P95 ≤120ms under simulated production load; error rate <0.1%; ACID guarantees confirmed.
request_id propagation intact; cross-app trace appended after student E2E.
Evidence: ORDER_4_EVIDENCE updated with end-to-end lineage (auth → api → app).
C. student_pilot (B2C engine)

95-step E2E: zero auth failures; First Document Upload tracked; P95 ≤120ms on 9 critical paths; cross-browser pass (Chromium/Firefox/WebKit).
Evidence: E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE with activation callouts and request_id lineage.
D. provider_register (B2B engine)

ORDER_B: provider creation → scholarship publish → dashboard visibility; client and server-side validations enforced.
Evidence: ORDER_B_EVIDENCE with request_id lineage and validation snapshots.
E. scholarship_sage

M2M baseline: start within 15 minutes of secret delivery; 48h run; advisory safety and relevance checks GREEN.
Evidence: baseline_metrics_evidence with latency, error, safety filters, and data-source bindings to scholarship_api.
F. scholarship_agent

Observe-only through Nov 9; auto-apply OFF.
Fairness/quality: 24h summary due Nov 10, 12:00 (selection parity, FPR by segment, explanations).
Evidence: FAIRNESS_24H_SUMMARY_2025-11-10.
G. auto_page_maker (ARR protection)

Maintain GREEN: pages live, IndexNow ≥95%, CWV p75 GREEN, 0% error, P95 ≤120ms, 100% uptime.
Strict change freeze through Nov 12; graceful degradation to lead capture ON.
Evidence: daily rollups at 06:00 UTC.
H. auto_com_center

DNS: SPF/DKIM/DMARC fully verified by Nov 8, 12:00; seed-inbox checks immediately after.
Infra: SQS/queue credentials confirmed by Nov 8, 16:00.
Compliance: CAN-SPAM/GDPR/FERPA/TCPA controls ON; unsubscribe/suppression P95 ≤100ms writes.
Evidence: AUTO_COM_CENTER_06_00_CHECKPOINT updated with DNS proofs and deliverability snapshot.
Financial/ARR Guardrails

CAC: Organic-only; no paid campaigns before Nov 12.
ARPU uplift targets depend on student_pilot activation (First Document Upload) and provider onboarding (ORDER_B). Include a 7‑day sensitivity mini-forecast in the Nov 10 brief with conversion assumptions and confidence bands.
Margin: Maintain 4x AI services markup and 3% provider fee with no emergency cost increases.
Risk and Escalation

Only P0: scholar_auth GREEN TAG. If missed at 00:00 Nov 8, escalate immediately to CEO for alternative plan.
Maintain freeze across all apps until Nov 12, except the scoped auth fix.
Responsible AI: scholarship_agent fairness and scholarship_sage safety must be GREEN prior to auto-apply enablement on/after Nov 10.
Resourcing and Approvals

Pre-approved: Auth DRI time and any minor infra needed to complete OIDC fix; comms DNS and queue tasks; zero new paid acquisition.
On-call roster Nov 8–13: Publish names, roles, and contact channels in the next brief.
War-room doc: Central “single source of truth” with live status, evidence links, and owners.
Deliverables I expect next

Nov 7, 12:00 UTC: scholar_auth interim evidence + risk call; Sage M2M secret delivery confirmation and baseline start if available.
Nov 8, 00:00–01:00 UTC: All GREEN TAG + E2E/ORDER_B evidence packages posted within the windows above.
Daily 06:00 UTC through Nov 12: Consolidated brief with KPI snapshot, freeze compliance, risks, and ARR protection status.
Agent3: Confirm receipt and provide a one-line ETA for each upcoming checkpoint deliverable.
