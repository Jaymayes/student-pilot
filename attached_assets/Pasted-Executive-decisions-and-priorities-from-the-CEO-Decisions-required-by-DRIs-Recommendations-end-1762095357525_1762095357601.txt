Executive decisions and priorities from the CEO

Decisions required by DRIs

Recommendations endpoint ownership and path
Decision: scholarship_sage is the system of record for intelligent/personalized recommendations.
Endpoint: Use scholarship_sage /recommendations as the primary interface.
Auth: JWT required. The service must accept either:
GET /recommendations for the JWT subject (preferred), and
GET /recommendations/{student_id} restricted to Admin/SystemService for support and batch operations.
Data flow: scholarship_sage pulls current profile and scholarship data from scholarship_api via M2M and returns ranked recommendations.
2. “Shadow endpoint” for campaigns

Decision: Not for production. Do not introduce a shadow /campaigns endpoint in scholarship_sage.
Rationale: Avoid scope creep and tech debt; keep marketing/campaigns decoupled from matching intelligence. If/when we need campaign content, we will source it via auto_com_center or a dedicated content service.
Action: Defer campaigns to a separate track. Not a gating item for FOC.
3. Gate 3 E2E authorization

Decision: GO. E2E testing is authorized immediately.
Preconditions: Use the already-registered OIDC client and production URLs. Do not expose secrets in client-side code. PKCE should be enabled if the client is public.
Priority execution plan (who/what/when)

Frontend DRI (student_pilot) – Start now

Configure the provided production OIDC and endpoint env vars (already delivered).
Deploy to production and execute the B2C E2E run with ≥30 samples.
Deliver the evidence bundle within 2 hours:
HAR files and latency (P50/P95/P99)
Success/failure counts (401/403/4xx/5xx)
Lighthouse accessibility report (target ≥90)
Security headers and CSRF verification
Feature flag: primary path points to scholarship_sage /recommendations. Keep fallback flag ready but OFF by default.
Sage DRI (scholarship_sage) – Start now (parallel)

Confirm production availability of GET /recommendations (JWT-subject) and GET /recommendations/{student_id} (Admin/SystemService).
Enforce scopes and RBAC; document response schema and version it (v1).
Validate M2M calls to scholarship_api; include request_id in responses and standardized errors.
Publish a one-pager API contract link to the Section 7 evidence.
API DRI (scholarship_api) – Start now (parallel)

No change in ownership; remain source of truth for profiles, scholarships, and applications.
Provide cached “last-known” recommendations read-through endpoint only if Sage is down (feature-flagged failover, TTL ≤24h). Default OFF.
Ensure JWKS validation and RBAC are green; keep P95 ≤120ms.
Auth DRI (scholar_auth)

OIDC is complete; proceed to produce the HAR capture for auth code → token exchange to close the remaining evidence gap.
Confirm JWKS endpoint health, CORS allowlist (student_pilot, provider_register), rate limiting, and rotate the student_pilot client secret at first GA milestone (≤30 days).
B2B DRI (provider_register)

Start RBAC isolation tests immediately after E2E auth confirmation from student_pilot.
Deliver 30-sample evidence set within 12 hours of Gate 1 GREEN.
SEO DRI (auto_page_maker) and Agent DRI (scholarship_agent)

Stay on T+24h for Section 7 submissions.
For auto_page_maker: verify trigger on scholarship create/update, metadata, schema markup, and deployment proof.
For scholarship_agent: validate M2M auth, retries/circuit breakers, and event dispatch to auto_com_center.
Acceptance criteria to declare FOC ready for these gates

Student_pilot E2E (B2C)

P95 latency ≤120ms on UI’s critical API calls
Auth success rate ≥98%, zero P0 auth defects
Accessibility Lighthouse ≥90
0 critical 5xx during the test window
Recommendations widget calling scholarship_sage /recommendations with valid JWT
Scholarship_sage

/recommendations endpoints operational with documented schema
RBAC/scopes enforced; 401/403 verified
Standardized error format with request_id; logs correlate requests across services
Scholarship_api

Continues to pass RBAC and SLOs; failover recommendations endpoint remains OFF
Scholar_auth

HAR evidence delivered
CORS, rate-limiting, password hashing, JWKS validation green
Scope discipline and risk notes

Do not ship a stopgap /campaigns shadow endpoint in scholarship_sage.
Keep marketing/campaigns separate; if needed later, we’ll route via auto_com_center or a dedicated service.
Ensure refresh-token handling complies with security policy (httpOnly, rotation, revocation).
FERPA/COPPA/consent flows: confirm no PII is exposed in URLs; prefer JWT-subject-based access patterns.
Lifecycle and revenue perspective

The chosen architecture aligns with our principles:
scholarship_api as source of truth
scholarship_sage as the intelligence layer for revenue-driving personalization
Expected refresh horizons remain:
scholarship_sage intelligence cycle: 2–3 years (model/logic refresh)
student_pilot UI: 3–4 years (UX/AI-UX evolution)
No added tech debt from shadow endpoints that would accelerate these cycles.
Directives summary

Endpoint owner: scholarship_sage
Endpoint path: /recommendations (JWT-subject) + /recommendations/{student_id} (Admin/SystemService)
Shadow endpoint for campaigns: No (defer)
E2E authorization: GO now
Deliver student_pilot E2E evidence in 2 hours; provider_register RBAC in 12 hours post-auth GREEN; remaining three Section 7 reports by T+24h
Report back when:

student_pilot E2E bundle is uploaded and green
scholarship_sage publishes the API contract for /recommendations
provider_register completes RBAC evidence set
This sequencing keeps us on track for FOC while protecting long-term maintainability and revenue velocity.
