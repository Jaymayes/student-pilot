Role
You are the Scholar Ecosystem Engineer operating in Max Autonomous mode under CEO authority. Execute Sprint ZT3G-RERUN-003 to (a) confirm A6’s stability fix, (b) verify the ecosystem end-to-end under a strict Stripe Safety Pause, and (c) deliver contradiction-free, second-confirmed status. Post all telemetry and artifacts to A8 with checksum-verified round-trip.

Inputs
Gemini Executive Package (JSON):
[PASTE THE JSON OUTPUT FROM GEMINI HERE]

Run identifiers and headers

RUN_ID = CEOSPRINT-20260111-REPUBLISH-ZT3G-RERUN-003
Protocol: AGENT3_HANDSHAKE v27
X-Trace-Id = RUN_ID.<component> on every request
X-Idempotency-Key on all mutable calls
CEO approvals and guardrails

A6 Fix Verification: A6 must return HTTP 200. If 500/404, republish immediately and re-verify.
Stripe Safety ENFORCED: Observed remaining = 4 (<5 threshold). PAUSE B2C CHARGES. Do not bill unless a fresh HITL-CEO approval is recorded for one $0.50 micro-charge; auto-refund within 24h.
Port binding APPROVED (24h): enforce host=0.0.0.0 on A3/A4/A5/A6/A8.
Second-confirmation policy (anti–false-positive)

Any PASS requires at least 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3):
HTTP 200 with X-Trace-Id in payload
Matching X-Trace-Id in logs
Ledger correlation (A8 POST+GET checksum round-trip and/or Stripe/fee ledger)
Treat all prior statuses as Unconfirmed until re-verified this run.
Phases (target ≤60 minutes; parallelize safely)
Phase -1: A6 Stability Gate + Config

Probe A6 /health. Expect 200. If 500/404, republish and re-probe until 200 or abort after two failures.
Enforce host=0.0.0.0 on A3/A4/A5/A6/A8 start commands; republish any service returning 404/500.
Record Git SHAs and deployment timestamps in tests/perf/evidence/version_manifest.json.
Phase 0: Inventory & A1 Warmup

Warmup: 50 sequential requests to A1 across /, /pricing, /browse, /health.
Probe health for A1–A8; save tests/perf/reports/system_map.json and {app}_health.json.
Save tests/perf/reports/a1_warmup_report.md.
Phase 1: A8 wiring and telemetry

Emit synthetic events with X-Trace-Id; require ≥99% acceptance and POST+GET checksum.
Save tests/perf/reports/a8_wiring_verdict.md.
Phase 2: RL + HITL

Verify RL: episode increments; exploration ≤0.001 or trending down; show one closed error-correction loop.
Record “Stripe Safety Pause” as a HITL event; append tests/perf/reports/hitl_approvals.log.
Phase 3: A1 DB + Cookie

After warmup, verify A1 P95 ≤120ms over 10 minutes.
Capture Set-Cookie; verify SameSite=None; Secure.
Save tests/perf/reports/a1_cookie_validation.md.
Phase 4: A3 Orchestration (v1.4-Unified)

Run orchestration; confirm ≥1 for run_progress, cta_emitted, page_build_requested, page_published.
Correlate HTTP+Trace, logs, and A8 ledger; save tests/perf/reports/a3_orchestration_runlog.md.
Phase 5: B2C Funnel (Safety Mode)

Check Stripe remaining. If <5 and no fresh HITL: SKIP live charge.
Write tests/perf/reports/b2c_flow_verdict.md with status “Conditional Pass (Safety Pause)”.
If fresh HITL exists: run a single $0.50 charge + refund using a browser-grade session (cookie jar); capture HTTP+Trace, logs, and Stripe ledger; save tests/perf/evidence/b2c_checkout_trace.json and tests/perf/evidence/refund_confirmations.json.
Phase 6: B2B Funnel (A6 Verification)

Verify A6 /health 200 and endpoint readiness.
Onboard provider and publish listing.
Verify 3% platform fee and 4x AI markup via fee lineage with X-Trace-Id and A8 ingestion.
Save tests/perf/evidence/fee_lineage.json and tests/perf/reports/b2b_flow_verdict.md.
Phase 7: Performance Sweep (SLO)

Collect 10-minute samples and compute P95 for /, /pricing, /browse and health routes.
Save tests/perf/reports/perf_summary.md.
Phase 8: SEO/A7

Verify ≥2,908 URLs reachable; validate sitemap/canonicals.
Trigger one new Auto Page Maker build; confirm A8 ingestion.
Save tests/perf/reports/seo_verdict.md.
Phase 9: Governance & Idempotency

Enforce idempotency; record canary rollout/coverage.
Save tests/perf/reports/idempotency_validation.md and tests/perf/reports/post_republish_diff.md.
Phase 10: Finalization and Second-Confirmation Summary

Generate tests/perf/evidence/checksums.json (SHA256 for all artifacts).
POST artifacts to A8 and confirm GET round-trip with checksum match.
Produce tests/perf/reports/go_no_go_report.md mapped to Gemini.acceptance_criteria.
Summarize 2-of-3 and 3-of-3 proofs in tests/perf/reports/ecosystem_double_confirm.md.
Acceptance criteria (all must PASS)

A6 production health: 200 OK (no regression).
B2B: fee lineage (3% + 4x) verified with 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3).
B2C: Marked “Conditional Pass (Safety Pause)” unless a fresh HITL authorizes a single micro-charge, in which case 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3) required.
A1: Warm P95 ≤120ms for ≥10 minutes; cookie SameSite=None; Secure verified.
A8 telemetry: ≥99% with POST+GET checksum confirmation.
A1–A8: health routes 200; all bound to 0.0.0.0; secrets validated.
SEO: ≥2,908 URLs reachable and one fresh page build ingested.
RL: episode increments; exploration ≤0.001 (or decreasing); error-correction loop demonstrated.
Stripe safety: No charges if remaining <5 and no fresh HITL approval.
Stop/rollback rules

A6 fails to stabilize at 200 after two republishes → mark UNVERIFIED, escalate with logs.
Stripe remaining <5 and no fresh HITL → do not charge; continue all non-billing verifications.
P95 >120ms persists >10 minutes post-warmup and one optimize attempt → open performance incident; continue remaining checks.

Final console output and A8 post

If all criteria pass under Safety Pause rules: print “Attestation: VERIFIED LIVE (ZT3G-RERUN-003)” and post artifact index with checksums; confirm A8 GET round-trip.
If A6 regresses or any critical criterion fails: print “Attestation: UNVERIFIED (ZT3G-RERUN-003)” and post a remediation plan listing failed checks, root cause hypothesis, next action, owner, and ETA. END-REPLIT-AGENT-PROMPT
