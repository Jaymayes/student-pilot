STATUS: GO | Delivering your final, identity‑aware prompts and runbooks

Below are two deliverables you asked for to finish the go‑live watch cleanly:

A T+24h Pulse Report Master Prompt (identity‑aware; each app only executes its own section).
A1 cache‑header change ticket template (copy‑ready).
You can paste either block directly into the Agent. Every section forces the app to self‑identify first and to include its app name and base URL on all reports.

T+24h Pulse Report — Identity‑Aware Master Prompt
Paste this into the Agent. Each app must run ONLY its section.

GLOBAL

Before any work, print exactly: APP: <app_name> | APP_BASE_URL: <base_url>
Execute only your section below. Ignore all other sections.
Read-only checks. Do not change code/infra.
Evidence to capture: HTTP status, latency_ms, key headers (Location, Set-Cookie), and any error fields. Use tags: LATENCY RISK (>200ms), REVENUE BLOCKER.
Required report format at the end.

A1 scholar_auth (Identity Provider)

GET /.well-known/openid-configuration and /.well-known/jwks.json → 200; record latency_ms.
Dry-run /oidc/auth for A5 and A6 (redirects disabled). Confirm 302/303 with PKCE S256 and interaction/resume cookies (SameSite=None; Secure; HttpOnly).
Output: 2xx/3xx rates, P95 latency (Discovery, JWKS), any invalid_client or server_error counts.
Risk: if discovery or JWKS P95 >300ms → LATENCY RISK.
A2 scholarship_api (Stateless API)

GET /health → 200; record latency_ms.
Confirm no login endpoints (/login, /auth/login, /api/auth/login → 404/401).
Protected negative test (one route) → 401/403/422; no PII.
Output: health latency, endpoint posture, error sample (masked).
A3 scholarship_agent (Marketing; no login surface)

GET /api/health → 200; latency_ms.
Confirm /login, /auth/login, /api/auth/login are SPA shell/404 (not auth).
Report ISSUER_URL (read-only). List 1 student CTA href (A5) and, if present, 1 provider CTA href (A6).
Output: latency, CTA evidence, no local login confirmation.
A4 scholarship_sage (Advisor; defers auth)

GET /api/health → 200; latency_ms.
Verify no local login handler; /login should be SPA shell/404; /api/login → 401 expected.
Output: latency, deferral confirmation.
A5 student_pilot (B2C login client)

GET /api/login (redirects disabled) → expect 302/303/307 to A1 /oidc/auth with PKCE S256. Capture Location params and latency_ms.
GET /api/callback?error=access_denied → expect safe 302; no 5xx.
Output: /api/login P95 vs target <200ms; any invalid_client count.
A6 provider_register (B2B login client)

GET /api/login and /auth/login (redirects disabled) → expect 302/303/307 to A1 with PKCE S256. Capture params and latency_ms.
GET /auth/callback?error=access_denied → 302; no 5xx.
Output: /auth/login P95 vs target <230ms; PKCE S256 present.
A7 auto_page_maker (SEO funnel)

Confirm at least 1 CTA to A5 and 1 to A6 with ?utm_source=auto_page_maker.
HEAD/GET CTA targets; record latency_ms; note any >200ms LATENCY RISK.
Confirm no local login handler (SPA shell/404 is ok).
Output: CTA href samples; target reachability.
A8 auto_com_center (Telemetry)

GET /healthz → 200; record latency_ms.
Summarize last 24h SLOs from alerts/probes (warn/crit counts, current status).
Report P95 for: A1 discovery/JWKS; A5 /api/login; A6 /auth/login. Summarize invalid_client and interaction_cookie_missing counts (should be 0).
Output: overall verdict (GO/N0‑GO), active alerts, recommended actions if any.

A1 Cache Headers Change Ticket — Copy‑Ready Template
Use this to schedule the cache optimization safely.

APP: scholar_auth | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

STATUS: PLANNED CHANGE (A1-CHG-2025-001)

Change summary
Add Cache-Control: public, max-age=300 to:
/.well-known/openid-configuration
/.well-known/jwks.json
Add deploy pre‑warm to touch both endpoints on start.
Goal: reduce discovery/JWKS P95 to ≤150 ms post‑deploy.
2. Business justification

Lower login funnel latency to protect conversion. JWKS/discovery called frequently by clients; caching reduces cold-start spikes.
3. Scope and components

A1 web server config/routes for the two endpoints.
No schema/data changes; no dependency version changes.
4. Pre‑checks (must be Green before starting)

Current A1 health green; no active incidents.
A8 alerts: IdPConfigLatency* not firing.
Probes: last run <5 min; success.
5. Implementation plan (20‑minute window)

Step 1: Enable headers on both endpoints.
Step 2: Deploy to a single instance; run pre‑warm script (HEAD both endpoints x3).
Step 3: Verify headers present (Cache-Control), status 200, and latency ≤150 ms.
Step 4: Roll out to remaining instances.
Step 5: Monitor A8 tiles for 30 minutes (IdPConfigLatency).
6. Validation / Acceptance criteria

Discovery and JWKS return 200 with Cache-Control: public, max-age=300.
P95 latency for both ≤150 ms over 30 minutes.
No increase in /oidc/auth 4xx; no invalid_client spikes.
7. Rollback plan

Revert header config commit; redeploy.
Pre‑warm again to restore prior behavior.
Confirm P95 settles to pre‑change levels; no incidents.
8. Risk assessment

Low risk. Read-only response header change. Mitigations: pre‑warm, staged rollout, immediate rollback.
9. Communications

Notify #ops and #security 15 min before change and at completion with validation snapshot.
10. Schedule / Ownership

Schedule: within the next 48 hours, off‑peak.
Owner: A1 on‑call
Approver: CEO/CTO (one‑click)
If you want, I can also produce a staging‑first A/B validation plan (5%/25%/100%) and a short post‑change observation script you can run from A8 to confirm the P95 improvement automatically.
