As CEO of Scholar AI Advisor, I’ve reviewed the reports and am issuing final readiness decisions and directives per Section V. Each app’s report begins with the mandated top matter.

APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED
Blockers:

Manual validation of the new MFA voluntary enrollment flow (OIDC preview constraints reported).
Gate C: Auth performance verification (target P95 ≤120ms) scheduled for Nov 12, 20:00 UTC. Estimated Go-Live Date:

Integration: Versioned APIs documented at /openapi.json; JWT/JWKS integration validated.
Reliability: Freeze in place; 5-minute rollback plan for DEF-005 post-freeze.
Data governance: Business events and audit logs active. Evidence links:
OpenAPI spec: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/openapi.json CEO directives:

APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Observer/Frozen)
Confirmation of Section IV compliance:

Security/Compliance: HOTL/HITL approval gates; 100% request_id; audit trails active.
Performance/Reliability: Uptime 99.9%+; error rate ~0%; sends disabled until gates pass.
Responsible AI: Rationale coverage ~97%; parity remediation plan scheduled post-freeze. Blockers:
Selection parity: 8 cohorts outside bounds; remediation sprint Nov 12–15. Estimated dates:
Parity evidence package due Nov 15, 20:00 UTC. ARR Ignition:
Indirect contributor; must remain gated until student_pilot GO and deliverability Gate A are green. CEO directives:
Hold autonomous sends. Execute parity remediation sprint post-freeze; report daily at 12:00 UTC.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Observer/Frozen)
Confirmation of Section IV compliance:

BI/KPIs: Ready to ingest 06:00 UTC cross-app metrics; dashboard rollups prepared.

Deliver final fairness integration spec by Nov 12, 22:00 UTC; begin daily 06:00 UTC rollups immediately.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Conditional GO)
Blockers:

Gate A (deliverability) outcome (owned by auto_com_center).
Gate C (auth P95) outcome (owned by scholar_auth).
CEO GO/NO-GO set for Nov 13, 16:00 UTC. Risk mitigations:
In-app notifications live; onboarding must not pause if Gate A fails. Estimated Go-Live Date:
Earliest Nov 13, 16:00 UTC, contingent on Gates A + C. ARR Ignition:
B2C credits earliest Nov 13–15; activation telemetry “first document upload” already tracked. CEO directives:
Maintain readiness; no dependency on email for critical flows. Confirm activation telemetry inclusion in 06:00 UTC rollups.
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Waitlist; Conditional GO)
Blockers:

Gate B: Stripe webhook E2E validation (incl. refunds) scheduled Nov 11, 18:00 UTC; report due 18:15 UTC.
Gate C: Auth performance dependency (scholar_auth). Controls:
ENABLE_WAITLIST_MODE=true; no charges until FULL GO authorized by CEO. Estimated Go-Live Date:
No earlier than Nov 14 (post Gate B + C PASS). ARR Ignition:
B2B 3% platform fee earliest Nov 14–15; clean audit trail and deterministic fee calc confirmed. Third-Party Dependencies:
Stripe + Finance coordination; webhook secrets and live key validated. CEO directives:
Execute Gate B with Finance at 18:00 UTC and submit evidence by 18:15 UTC. No charges until explicit FULL GO.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Frozen)
Confirmation of Section IV compliance:

Performance/SEO: CWV p75 GREEN; indexation ≥95%; daily 06:00 UTC KPI exports operational.
Reliability: Freeze enforced; alerts on CWV regression or indexation <92%. ARR Ignition:
Primary low-CAC engine feeding student_pilot and provider_register. CEO directives:
Maintain freeze through Nov 12, 20:00 UTC; auto-alert and hold page generation on any regression.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Gate A in-flight; Conditional GO)
Blockers:

Gate A deliverability certification (SPF/DKIM/DMARC p=quarantine, seed inbox ≥80%, complaints ≤0.1%, bounces ≤2%).
Evidence due Nov 11, 20:15 UTC; escalation triggers defined for Postmark/DKIM DNS. Estimated Go-Live Date:
Nov 11, 20:15 UTC (if PASS). If FAIL, immediate switch to in-app notifications for student_pilot and retry Nov 12, 12:00 UTC. ARR Ignition:
Enabler for conversion lift; not a primary revenue source itself. Third-Party Dependencies:
Postmark/ESP, DNS propagation (DKIM CNAMEs), DMARC reporting. CEO directives:
Deliver evidence bundle by 20:15 UTC; prep p=reject DMARC move for T+7 days post-PASS with 5-minute rollback.
Executive Go/No-Go summary and gating timeline

Gate B (Stripe): Nov 11, 18:00 UTC execution; 18:15 UTC evidence (provider_register). Required for B2B ARR ignition.
Gate A (Deliverability): Nov 11, 20:00–20:15 UTC (auto_com_center). Student flows continue via in-app notifications if FAIL.
Gate C (Auth P95): Nov 12, 20:00–20:15 UTC (scholar_auth). Hard dependency for ecosystem scale-up.
CEO GO/NO-GO for student_pilot: Nov 13, 16:00 UTC (pending Gates A + C).
ARR ignition plan (decision-ready)

B2C credits: Earliest Nov 13–15, contingent on A + C. Success hinges on frictionless activation; “first document upload” telemetry must appear in Nov 11 06:00 UTC rollup and onward.
B2B 3% fees: Earliest Nov 14–15, contingent on A + B + C. No charges until CEO FULL GO; deterministic fee audit logs mandatory.
Risk, compliance, and Responsible AI guardrails (affirmed)

SLOs: Maintain 99.9% uptime and ≤120ms P95. Rollback within 5 minutes on SLO threat during any change window.
Security/Privacy: MFA rollout staged; TLS enforced; RBAC across apps; audit logging pervasive; no “black box” pricing or selection.
Responsible AI: scholarship_agent remains in observer mode; parity remediation sprint scheduled and tracked; fairness spec finalization due Nov 12, 22:00 UTC (scholarship_sage).
Regulatory readiness: Continue audit log retention, access controls, and change management; DMARC p=reject within 7 days after Gate A PASS.
Immediate actions required today

auto_com_center: Execute Gate A; deliver evidence by 20:15 UTC; prep DMARC p=reject T+7d.
provider_register + Finance: Execute Gate B at 18:00 UTC; submit PASS/FAIL report by 18:15 UTC.
scholar_auth: Complete manual MFA validation in a real browser and post results; prepare for Gate C on Nov 12.
scholarship_sage: Publish first 06:00 UTC cross-app KPI rollup and confirm ingestion feeds from all apps.
All DRIs: Maintain freeze disciplines and escalation protocols; include request_id in all evidence and logs.
Final CEO decisions

GO-LIVE READY: scholarship_api, auto_page_maker, scholarship_sage (observer), scholarship_agent (observer).
DELAYED: scholar_auth (pending manual test + Gate C), student_pilot (conditional GO; CEO decision Nov 13), provider_register (Gate B + C), auto_com_center (Gate A).
Proceed exactly per gating schedule, with immediate escalations on defined triggers. Keep CAC near zero by protecting the SEO flywheel and ensuring frictionless student value delivery.
Return-to-green expectations

Any FAIL at a gate triggers the documented contingency without pausing student_pilot onboarding. Evidence updates are due within 15 minutes of each gate decision window.
