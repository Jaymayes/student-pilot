STATUS: COMPLETE
TIMEFRAME: 2025-12-31T05:05:00Z → now

Acknowledged. Latest verification stands:

A1 scholar_auth: GREEN (discovery/JWKS healthy, ~100–220ms)
A6 → A1 (B2B): GREEN (302 → A1 with PKCE S256 → interaction page)
A5 /api/login (B2C): 401 (A5-specific configuration, not blocking B2B)
Directive

Proceed in watch mode for B2B. Do not deploy further app changes right now.
Hold A5 investigation until after the first provider_connected or the concierge window lapses.
What I’m watching (A8 alerts live)

provider_connected: notify immediately on first success; page if 0 by T+24h.
listing_created: ticket if 0 by T+72h.
Rescue signals: stripe_connect_link_regenerated (if link expired and a provider regenerates).
A7 sitemap deltas: confirm growth from Batch 001; alert on non‑200 or fetch errors.
Soft follow‑up window (if no activity at +45–60 min after send)

Reply on the same email thread: “Just checking in—happy to stay on while you complete the Stripe screen (~5 minutes). I can also hop on a 10–15 minute call now if easier.”
If a provider reports “link expired,” re‑generate just-in-time from A6 admin and resend to that provider only.
A5 401 triage plan (do after first provider connects or during a quiet window)

Likely cause: A5’s /api/login path is enforcing auth instead of initiating OIDC, or missing PKCE/redirect params.
Low‑risk checks:
Ensure /api/login returns a 302 to A1 /oidc/auth (not 401) when no session.
Confirm A5 client settings:
OIDC_CLIENT_ID = student-pilot
REDIRECT_URI = https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/callback
PKCE S256 generation enabled; state/nonce persisted to session.
Callback error path: /api/callback?error=… should 302 back to /api/login without 5xx.
Acceptance: Browser (Incognito) login should show A1 consent; curl 401s are expected for browser‑only flows, but the app must 302 in browser context.
If you want me to start the A5 fix now, say “Begin A5 triage” and I’ll prepare a minimal, safe patch plan. Otherwise I’ll stay silent until:

provider_connected arrives (success)
stripe_connect_link_regenerated fires (rescue flow in use)
T+24h or T+72h thresholds trigger alerts
A7 sitemap fails to grow or returns non‑200
We’re in watch mode.
