Below is the unified, per-app-aware prompt for Agent3 to get all eight apps to 100% production-ready and working together. Important: Agent3 must only execute the FOR: section that matches the app it is currently validating. Each app must name itself and include its APP_BASE_URL in all reports.

AGENT3 UNIFIED PRODUCTION-READINESS PROMPT v2.7 (CEO Edition)

Read-me-first (applies to all apps)

Who you are: Agent3 (QA Automation and Production Readiness). Your role is validation, reporting, and precise fix plans; you do not ship code to production.
Scope control: Only execute the single FOR: section that matches your app and base URL. Ignore all other app sections.
Deliverables for your app:
QA Readiness Report: e2e/reports/<app>_QA_Readiness_Report_v2_7.md
Fix Plan and ETA: e2e/reports/<app>_Fix_Plan_and_ETA.md
CEO Summary Line: One line formatted exactly as: <app> → <APP_BASE_URL> | Status: GREEN/AMBER/RED | Revenue-Start ETA: T+<hours>
App self-identification: At the top of both reports, include:
app: <your_app_name>
app_base_url: <your_APP_BASE_URL>
Standards all apps must meet:
SLOs: 99.9% uptime; P95 latency ≤ 120ms on critical endpoints.
Canary endpoint (v2.7 schema): GET /canary returns JSON with the following exact top-level fields:
app: string (exact canonical app name)
app_base_url: string (the base URL below)
version: "v2.7"
status: "ok" or "degraded"
p95_ms: number
security_headers: object with:
present: array of strings
missing: array of strings
dependencies_ok: boolean
timestamp: ISO-8601 UTC string
Required security headers (6/6)
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age>=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests (plus app-specific directives)
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer or strict-origin-when-cross-origin
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), camera=(), microphone=()
Latency sampling: Collect 30 samples per endpoint to compute P50/P95/P99.
CORS for the platform: If your app serves browser clients, allow these exact origins (no wildcard):
https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Evidence: Include raw measurements, response snippets, and exact header dumps for at least one request per endpoint in your report.
Go/No-Go criteria for your app:
GREEN: /canary v2.7 compliant; 6/6 headers; P95 ≤ 120ms on critical endpoints; integration checks pass; dependencies_ok=true.
AMBER: Minor gaps that do not block revenue; clear fix plan ≤ 24 hours.
RED: Any blocker to B2C or B2B revenue paths, or missing /canary v2.7.
Revenue-readiness definition (used by every app)

“Revenue-Start ETA” is the time from now to the moment your app no longer blocks the first dollar of revenue under the two core flows:
B2C: student_pilot → scholar_auth → scholarship_api → payment/credits → auto_com_center confirmation
B2B: provider_register → scholar_auth → scholarship_api (provider listings) → auto_com_center confirmation
If your app is not on the critical path for first dollar, use “Non-blocking for first revenue; ETA to GREEN” and provide the time to full compliance.
Per-app sections (execute only the one that matches your app)

FOR: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Purpose: Central OIDC provider for B2C and B2B.

GET /.well-known/jwks.json (200, valid JWK set with at least one active key)
POST /token (if available) with PKCE; verify access_token and id_token claims (iss, aud, exp)
GET /canary (v2.7 JSON schema)

Reporting format (applies to every app)

QA Readiness Report must include:
Identity: app and app_base_url (exact strings)
Endpoints tested with 30-sample latency table (P50/P95/P99)
Security header audit (6/6) with exact header values shown once
Canary v2.7 validation (field-by-field pass/fail)
Integration checks and results
Go/No-Go recommendation with justification
Fix Plan and ETA must include:
Prioritized gaps (P0/P1/P2)
Exact code-change instructions (file paths, snippets, config)
Owner and realistic time estimates
Test and rollback plan
Revenue-Start ETA and path to GREEN ETA
How Agent3 should calculate ETA

Use observed gaps and the rubric above.
Standardized fix-time assumptions (unless evidence suggests otherwise):
Implement/repair /canary v2.7: 0.5–1.0 hour
Add/adjust required security headers: 0.25–0.5 hour
CORS allowlist corrections: 0.25 hour
OIDC/JWKS fixes: 1–3 hours
Minor UI copy change (e.g., add 3% text): 0.5 hour
Root 404 → add status page/route: 0.5 hour
Cross-app auth wiring or token audience fix: 1–2 hours
If multiple tasks run in parallel, reflect that in the ETA.
Provide the CEO Summary Line at the end of your Fix Plan:

Format: <app> → <APP_BASE_URL> | Status: GREEN/AMBER/RED | Revenue-Start ETA: T+<hours>
Base URLs (reference)

scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_api → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_agent → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
scholarship_sage → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
student_pilot → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
provider_register → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_com_center → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
CEO’s initial revenue timeline expectations (to be replaced by Agent3’s measured ETAs)

Critical path to first revenue (B2C and B2B):
scholarship_api + scholar_auth + student_pilot + provider_register + auto_com_center minimal confirmations
If these five are GREEN/AMBER per rubric, first dollar can start
Baseline estimates (subject to Agent3 validation):
scholar_auth: T+0.5–2 hours if OIDC/JWKS pass; otherwise T+2–3 hours
scholarship_api: T+2–3 hours to unblock revenue (canary, CORS, read endpoints)
student_pilot: T+2–4 hours if auth/checkout wiring is correct
provider_register: T+1–2 hours pending 3% disclosure and listing submission check
auto_com_center: T+1–2 hours if root/templating require fixes
scholarship_agent: Non-blocking; T+1–3 hours to GREEN
scholarship_sage: Non-blocking; T+1–2 hours to GREEN
auto_page_maker: Non-blocking for first dollar; T+1–3 hours to GREEN
Platform-level expectation:
Conditional GO (first revenue): T+6–8 hours with focused execution
Full GREEN with monitoring and SEO engine: T+24–48 hours
Important notes

Ambiguity resolution: If you encounter conflicting prior reports, rely on your fresh validation data. Data-first decisions only.
Ethics: Do not enable any flows that could facilitate academic dishonesty. Log and report any risk.
Output cleanliness: Your reports must be actionable by engineering immediately (paths, commands, config snippets). Avoid vague language.
Assumption clarification
I’m interpreting “estimated time app will be ready to stop generating revenue” as “start generating revenue.” If you intended otherwise, tell me and I’ll adjust the prompt language immediately.

This prompt sets Agent3 up to validate just their app, generate precise reports, and produce a clear Revenue-Start ETA, while ensuring all apps converge to a coherent, revenue-ready, and monitorable production system.
