Role
You are the Replit Agent for Scholar AI Advisor operating in Max Autonomous mode under CEO authority. Execute Sprint ZT3G-RERUN-007 (Truth & Reconciliation). Your objective is to FIX THE VERIFICATION GAP by proving the real state of core apps (A3, A8, A6) with raw evidence, eliminating false positives, and either:

Deliver a verified, second-confirmed “LIVE” attestation, or
Fail fast with a precise Manual Intervention Manifest for cross-workspace fixes the agent cannot perform from here.
Critical context

Prior “Gold Standard” claims were false positives while A3/A8 still returned 404 from improper binding (127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0).
You are confined to this workspace; you CANNOT edit or republish A3/A8 if they are broken.
Stripe remaining ≈4 (<5). B2C charges must remain paused.
Run identifiers and headers

RUN_ID = CEOSPRINT-20260111-REPUBLISH-ZT3G-RERUN-007
Protocol: AGENT3_HANDSHAKE v27
X-Trace-Id = RUN_ID.<component> on every request
X-Idempotency-Key on all mutable calls
Inputs and discovery

Discover service URLs/endpoints (A3_URL, A8_URL, A6_URL) from env files (.env, ENV vars), service registry, or prior artifacts. Prefer explicit health endpoints: /health or /readyz.
Guardrails (no more false positives)

Raw Truth Rule: You MUST capture raw HTTP headers (not summaries) using curl -I -v for A3, A8, A6.
Fail-Fast: If any core app returns a non-200 status, STOP immediately. Do not continue to funnels or print “verified”. Generate a Manual Intervention Manifest for the CEO with exact cross-workspace fix steps.
Stripe Safety: With remaining <5, never execute a charge. B2C is “Conditional Pass (Safety Pause)”.
Second confirmation: For any “PASS” claim, gather at least 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3): HTTP 200 + X-Trace-Id in response; matching X-Trace-Id in logs; A8 POST+GET checksum round-trip.
Phases (≤60 minutes; parallelize safely)

Phase -1: Raw Truth Probe (Anti-Hallucination Gate)

Run:
curl -I -v "$A3_URL/health" 2>&1 | tee -a /mnt/data/raw_curl_evidence.txt
curl -I -v "$A8_URL/health" 2>&1 | tee -a /mnt/data/raw_curl_evidence.txt
curl -I -v "$A6_URL/health" 2>&1 | tee -a /mnt/data/raw_curl_evidence.txt
Parse actual HTTP status codes for each app from the raw output.
Decision Gate:
If any status != 200:
Write tests/perf/reports/manual_intervention_manifest.md containing: • For each failing app (A3/A8/A6): observed status line copied from curl, probable root cause (not bound to 0.0.0.0, wrong PORT, app not started), and exact fix steps the CEO must do in that app’s Replit workspace:
Open <workspace>; set startup to bind --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT (or framework equivalent)
Ensure PORT env var is defined and used by the server
Republish/Deploy
Re-verify with curl -I -v <url>/health expecting HTTP/1.1 200 • A checklist of acceptance tests and screenshots/evidence to capture • Risk notes and rollback (revert to last good SHA if needed)
Save /mnt/data/raw_curl_evidence.txt as-is.
Print: Attestation: UNVERIFIED (ZT3G-RERUN-007) — Raw Truth Probe failed.
STOP the sprint.
If all three are 200: proceed to Phase 0.
Phase 0: Inventory & Strict A1 Warmup (performance truth)

Send 50 sequential requests to A1 across /, /pricing, /browse, /health to eliminate cold start.
Immediately probe A1 /health latency (target ≤120ms), then collect 10-minute samples to compute P95 for /, /pricing, /browse.
Persist service map and health:
tests/perf/reports/system_map.json
{app}_health.json for A1–A8
tests/perf/reports/a1_warmup_report.md (cold vs warm, P95 calc)
Phase 1: A8 Telemetry + Second Confirmation wiring

Emit trace-bearing events to A8; require ≥99% acceptance and POST+GET checksum round-trip for new artifacts.
Artifact: tests/perf/reports/a8_wiring_verdict.md
From now on, tie all “PASS” claims to raw evidence (trace + logs + A8 checksum where applicable).
Phase 2: RL + HITL (observational)

Verify RL episode increments; exploration ≤0.001 or trending down; one closed error-correction loop observed.
Log “Stripe Safety Pause Active (remaining <5)” to tests/perf/reports/hitl_approvals.log
Phase 3: A1 DB + Cookie (browser-grade)

Confirm A1 10-minute P95 ≤120ms; capture Set-Cookie with SameSite=None; Secure.
Artifact: tests/perf/reports/a1_cookie_validation.md
Phase 4: B2C funnel (Safety Mode)

Respect Safety Pause: no live charge. Mark Conditional Pass (Safety Pause) in tests/perf/reports/b2c_flow_verdict.md
Phase 5: B2B funnel (fee lineage verification)

Verify 3% platform fee + 4x AI markup lineage with 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3), using logs and A8 ledger correlation.
Artifacts: tests/perf/evidence/fee_lineage.json and tests/perf/reports/b2b_flow_verdict.md
Phase 6: Performance sweep (fleet P95)

Collect 10-minute P95 across /, /pricing, /browse and app health routes; artifact tests/perf/reports/perf_summary.md
Phase 7: SEO/A7 (observational)

Verify ≥2,908 URLs and sitemap/canonicals; artifact tests/perf/reports/seo_verdict.md
Phase 8: Finalization (artifact integrity)

Generate tests/perf/evidence/checksums.json for all artifacts
POST artifacts to A8 and confirm GET round-trip with matching checksums
Produce tests/perf/reports/go_no_go_report.md mapped to this prompt’s Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria (must all PASS to print “VERIFIED”)

Raw Truth: A3/A8/A6 /health return HTTP 200 in /mnt/data/raw_curl_evidence.txt (first line of each curl block copied verbatim in go_no_go_report.md)
No False Positives: If any core app != 200, the sprint stops and prints UNVERIFIED with a Manual Intervention Manifest (no partial “success” claims)
Stripe Safety: B2C remains “Conditional Pass (Safety Pause)” — no charges executed
A1: Warm probe ≤120ms and 10-minute P95 ≤120ms; cookie SameSite=None; Secure verified
B2B: Fee lineage verified with 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3) plus A8 correlation
A8 Telemetry: ≥99% acceptance with POST+GET checksum round-trip
Evidence integrity: checksums.json present and A8 round-trip confirmed

Final console output

If Raw Truth Probe (A3/A8/A6) = 200 and all acceptance criteria pass: Attestation: VERIFIED LIVE (ZT3G-RERUN-007 — TRUTH CONFIRMED)
If any core app fails the Raw Truth Probe: Attestation: UNVERIFIED (ZT3G-RERUN-007) Show path to tests/perf/reports/manual_intervention_manifest.md and echo the failing curl status lines.
