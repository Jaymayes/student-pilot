Approved and locked. Thank you for the precise plan and baselines. Here is the executive governance and the specific outcomes I expect over the next 72 hours, followed by what we do immediately after.

Governance and operating rhythm

Command cadence: 15-minute daily hardening stand-up; EOD status to exec channel with: item-by-item status, defect counts, newly blocked attacks, error budget, and any SLO movement.
Change control: All changes behind flags; canary to 10% traffic for 2 hours; auto-rollback if p95 latency +15% or 5xx rate +0.5% vs baseline.
Release policy: No production deploys with open High security issues. If any KPI breaches rollback guardrails, freeze and remediate before reattempt.
Definition of done (72 hours)

Sensitive data logging (RT-015)
Outcome: Zero PII/secret fields in logs across auth, billing, profile, and file-upload paths.
Controls live: Deny-by-default logging, allowlisted fields only, redaction at sink, JSON structured logs, correlation IDs on all requests.
Verification: Automated PII/secret scan in CI and a production log sampling job showing 0 violations over last 1M log lines.
2. Session cookie security (RT-018)

Outcome: SameSite=Lax (Strict where viable), Secure, HttpOnly, scoped paths; CSRF tokens required for all state-changing requests.
Verification: Runtime tests green; cross-site auth and embedded flows validated in staging and canary.
3. Authentication rate limiting

Outcome: Per-IP, per-account velocity limits; exponential backoff with jitter; soft lock + user notice; anomaly audit trail.
KPI: ≥95% of brute-force attempts blocked; false positives <0.5%.
Verification: Synthetic attack run in staging; dashboards show blocked attempts and FP rate.
4. Billing precision and reconciliation

Outcome: All amounts in integer minor units end-to-end (no floats); Stripe idempotency keys enforced; reconciliation monitor and ledger events live.
KPI: $0 rounding differences; 100% idempotent charge creation.
Verification: Reconciliation job shows zero deltas over 24h; unit and property tests for edge rounding.
5. Database async error handling

Outcome: Try/catch on async DB ops, transaction rollback on exceptions, retry with capped backoff for transient errors, circuit breaker on hot paths.
Verification: Fault injection in staging demonstrates clean rollback and no partial writes.
6. API client resilience (queryClient)

Outcome: Capped retries with backoff; offline queue where safe; unified error normalization; user-visible toasts.
KPI: Client-side network error rate reduced vs baseline; drop-off from network errors decreased.
Dashboards that must be live by Hour 48

Security and auth: Blocked attempts/day, FP rate, auth success rate, anomaly log stream.
Billing: Reconciliation deltas, idempotency failures, charge success/decline reasons.
Observability: Error budget burn, p95 latency, 5xx rate, canary vs control health.
Compliance: Log redaction violations (CI + prod sample), CSRF token presence rate on POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE.
Risk controls and runbooks

Rate limiting UX: Provide clear user messaging and a support override path for legitimate users locked out.
Cookie change fallout: Monitor sign-in success and session churn; rollback switch ready if unexpected SSO or embedded contexts break.
Billing hotfix rollback: Feature flag gating precision changes; reconcile and halt charges if deltas detected.
What happens immediately after the 72-hour sprint
We continue the Growth Sprint without delay. Priorities (owners already assigned):

SEO engine (Auto Page Maker): Publish the first 5–10k pages; structured data + sitemap; Core Web Vitals guardrail; index coverage report.
Conversion and monetization: Launch two A/Bs (pricing and onboarding) with experiment logging; Stripe entitlement checks live.
Provider MVP: Listing + application builder + Stripe Connect; secure 20 pilot providers or LOIs; “1‑click apply” behind consent gate.
Executive telemetry: Live KPI board for B2C/B2B, growth funnel, CWV, fee revenue, SLO/error budget.
Data/DevOps integration of QA artifacts

Ingest ./qa-analysis-report.json and ./qa-runtime-validation-report.json into the data lake and wire to the Security & Reliability board.
Establish weekly trendlines: open issues by severity, test pass rate, and time-to-close for High and Medium.
Final approvals and asks

Proceed now under the provided hour-by-hour sequence. Notify me immediately if any scope threatens SLOs, billing integrity, or introduces user-visible auth friction beyond the stated FP threshold.
By tomorrow 6 PM local: share the first dashboards (auth abuse, reconciliation, error budget) and a short EOD note confirming RT-015 and RT-018 fixes are live in canary without SLO regressions.
Separately, provide baseline growth KPIs (last 7 days): organic sessions, free-to-paid conversion, ARPU, index coverage, and provider pipeline count so I can set next month’s revenue targets and budget allocations.
This keeps us on track to compound low-CAC growth while safeguarding trust, payments, and partner credibility—directly supporting our path to profitable ARR. Execute.
