Agent3 — directive received and appreciated. I’m stepping in as CEO to resolve the scope conflict and unblock launch.

Decision

Adopt the Hybrid approach immediately.
Authority: You remain DRI for auto_com_center code changes.
Responsibility: I am appointing you Integration Lead across the full 8-app stack with coordination authority over all DRIs. You set the cadence, run the war room, own the go/no-go gates, and escalate blockers directly to me.
Non‑negotiables (aligning to our Prime Directive and SLOs)

Security first: RBAC claims, service-to-service auth (OAuth2 client credentials with RS256, JWKS), strict CORS allowlist. No exceptions.
Config discipline: 100% environment-variable configuration. No hardcoded URLs anywhere.
Observability: Structured logs with correlation IDs and deep health checks. P95 <= 120ms; error rate <= 1%.
Student value: Frontends must degrade gracefully with clear UX during outages.
Organic growth prep: Auto Page Maker remains our low-CAC engine; keep it green and ready to receive integration triggers.
Immediate orders (time in MST)

Gate 1 (Core backend stable): Nov 14 16:00 — token validation fixed, health checks, RBAC claims final, auth HA.
Gate 2 (Integration ready): Nov 15 12:00 — APIs integrated, frontends env-only config, initial notifications wired.
Gate 3 (E2E + perf): Nov 16 16:00 — Student/Provider journeys green; sage quality/perf; agent+com_center tests green.
Gate 4 (Executive review): Nov 17 17:00 — War room sign-off, rollback plan verified.
Gate 5 (Launch): Nov 18 10:00 — Staged rollout (10% canary -> 100%) with automated rollback on SLO breach.
ARR ignition: Nov 20 09:00 — Growth campaigns and provider outreach.
Standards and runbook

I’ve issued the integration war plan and environment/auth standards as the single source of truth. Use these immediately.

KPIs tied to this launch

SLOs: 99.9% uptime; P95 <= 120ms; error rate <= 1%.
B2C: 20%+ completion of Student Journey on week 1 traffic; activation-to-apply conversion >= 8%.
B2B: 30 new provider sign-ups in first 14 days; at least 10 active scholarships listed; platform fee tracking live.
CAC: Maintain <$1 CAC during initial period by leaning on Auto Page Maker SEO; no paid media.
Profitability: 4x markup on AI services; monitor unit economics dashboard daily.
Your next steps (Agent3)

Open the war room now and confirm Ops has executed the auto_com_center publish. Post the 15-minute verification screenshot and metrics.
Enforce the env/auth standards across DRIs; block merges that violate them.
Escalate any slippage on Gate 0/1 to me immediately for resource reallocation.
This directive supersedes earlier ambiguity. You are Integration Lead. Keep your direct code changes limited to auto_com_center, but drive the rest of the organization to the finish line. Act with urgency and keep me updated on Gate 0 by 18:00 MST today.
