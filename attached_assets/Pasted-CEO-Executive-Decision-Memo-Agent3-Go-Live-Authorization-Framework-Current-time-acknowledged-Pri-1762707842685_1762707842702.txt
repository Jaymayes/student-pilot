CEO Executive Decision Memo — Agent3 Go-Live Authorization Framework
Current time acknowledged. Prime directive reaffirmed: protect brand trust and the SEO flywheel while driving toward $10M profitable ARR. Scope confirmed: Agent3 is DRI for student_pilot and executor for auto_com_center deliverability T+90. All other apps remain in their existing posture under their respective DRIs.

APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED

Blockers

Deliverability GREEN depends on DNS_READY → T+90 certification (auto_com_center).
Stripe PASS (COO/Finance, deadline 19:00 UTC).
Pre-soak PASS (scheduled 20:00–21:00 UTC tonight) per guardrails.
Estimated Go-Live Date

Primary: Nov 11, 16:00 UTC (contingent on all gates GREEN with evidence).
Conditional: Nov 12, 16:00 UTC (if exactly one gate slips ≤24h with mitigation and CEO approval).
ARR Ignition

Start upon go-live: B2C credit sales (4x AI service markup). Revenue contributions begin Nov 11–12 if gates are GREEN.
Third-Party Dependencies

scholar_auth (OIDC/PKCE/SSO), scholarship_api (data), Postmark via auto_com_center (transactional mail), Stripe (payments), monitoring/alerting stack.
Readiness vs Section IV Requirements (executive confirmations)

Security & Compliance: MFA/SSO via scholar_auth; RBAC enforced; TLS in transit; no-PII logging checks prepared; audit logging on.
Scalability & Performance: Monitoring in place; target P95 ≤120ms app-side (≤200ms E2E); capacity acceptable for pre-soak.
Integration & Interoperability: E2E request_id lineage across auth → API → app; PKCE/revocation tests scheduled.
Reliability & Maintainability: 99.9% uptime SLO monitored; rollback plan defined; disaster recovery draft to be posted in evidence bundle.
Data Management & Analytics: Data integrity checks and activation funnel telemetry enabled; no PII in logs (FERPA/COPPA).
Testing & Deployment: Pre-soak tonight; T+30 evidence required; phased rollout plan approved; rollback procedures in place.
Evidence Commitments (tonight 21:30–22:00 UTC)

P50/P95 latency histograms, uptime, error tallies.
PKCE proof; immediate token revocation proof (via scholar_auth).
request_id lineage samples (auth → API → app).
No-PII log validation; executive summary with pass/fail call.
Operational Notes

Maintain comms/charging freeze until Deliverability GREEN and Stripe PASS.
Any guardrail breach during pre-soak triggers immediate rollback and 60-minute RCA.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (awaiting DNS_READY)

Blockers

DNS_READY from Deputy Ops (deadline 17:30 UTC) to trigger T0 for T+90 deliverability certification.
Estimated Go-Live Date

GREEN at T+90 from T0 (DNS_READY). Contingency deadline: Nov 10, 14:00 UTC latest.
ARR Ignition

Enables activation and transactional communications for B2C/B2B immediately upon GREEN; prerequisite for student_pilot conversion email flows.
Third-Party Dependencies

Postmark (shared pool), DNS provider (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), seed inboxes (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, Proton, iCloud +2).
Readiness vs Section IV Requirements (executive confirmations)

Security & Compliance: SPF/DKIM/DMARC with alignment; DMARC policy p=quarantine minimum; audit logs on.
Scalability & Performance: Postmark shared pool acceptable at current volumes; no dedicated IP until data supports.
Integration: Webhooks/templating integrated; evidence bundle prepared.
Reliability: Monitoring/alerting enabled; rollback plan defined.
Testing & Deployment: Seed testing plan locked; blue/green not applicable; T+90 certification standard operating procedure.
Success Criteria for GREEN

SPF/DKIM/DMARC PASS with alignment.
≥90% inbox placement, ≤10% Gmail Promotions.
≤0.3% bounce; zero blocklists.
DMARC p=quarantine confirmed.
Evidence Commitments (T+90 + 15 min)

DNS records screenshots; Postmark verification.
7 seed inbox headers; placement rates; bounce and blocklist checks.
Executive summary with clear GREEN/RED call.
CEO approvals, constraints, and escalations

Approvals: Proceed with pre-soak (20:00–21:00 UTC), T+30 evidence, and deliverability T+90 certification on DNS_READY.
Constraints: No external comms and no charging until Deliverability GREEN and Stripe PASS. No vendor switch and no dedicated IP until data justifies (only consider if seed placement <80% after two remediations).
Escalations:
If DNS_READY misses 17:30 UTC, escalate to CTO and immediately execute pre-approved fallback subdomain with fast-propagation nameservers.
If Stripe PASS misses 19:00 UTC, require ETA and mitigation plan; freeze remains.
Specific technical watch item: scholar_auth background token cleanup DB connection issue is non-blocking, but remediation is required before general availability; due date: Nov 12 EOD with RCA.
Tonight’s decision gates and timelines (all times UTC)

17:30: DNS_READY (Deputy Ops) → triggers deliverability T0.
T0+90: auto_com_center deliverability certification bundle due (+15 min to publish).
19:00: Stripe PASS (COO/Finance) or ETA.
20:00–21:00: Pre-soak window (all DRIs).
21:30–22:00: T+30 evidence bundles published; CEO review.
Go/No-Go framework for soft launch

GO (Nov 11, 16:00): Pre-soak PASS + Deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS; evidence complete.
CONDITIONAL GO (Nov 12, 16:00): Exactly one gate slips ≤24h with mitigation and explicit CEO approval.
NO-GO: Any gate unresolved or missing evidence; brand trust/SEO protection takes precedence.
KPIs to validate this phase

Deliverability: ≥90% inbox, ≤10% Gmail Promotions, ≥40% open rate on activation.
Activation (student_pilot): ≥35% first-session activation (first document upload).
Payments: ≥95% auth success; 100% refund success in test cases (post-Stripe PASS).
Platform SLOs: ≥99.9% uptime; P95 ≤120ms service-side (≤200ms E2E); error rate ≤0.1%.
CEO directive to Agent3

Execute exactly as planned; maintain evidence-first posture.
Post all evidence to the Master Evidence Index within 15 minutes of each milestone.
Do not lift the comms/charging freeze without my explicit GREEN signal after evidence review.
Provide immediate escalation if any gate risks missing its deadline; include mitigation and revised ETA.
Acknowledgment

This memo serves as formal executive approval of the stated plan, criteria, and constraints for student_pilot and auto_com_center. Proceed with urgency and discipline.
