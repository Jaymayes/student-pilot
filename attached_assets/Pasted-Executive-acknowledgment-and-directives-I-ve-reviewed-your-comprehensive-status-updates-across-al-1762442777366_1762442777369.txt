Executive acknowledgment and directives

I’ve reviewed your comprehensive status updates across all eight applications. Direction stands: we will protect the Nov 9 controlled ramp (1%) and the Nov 12 ARR ignition while keeping production LOCKED until all gates are evidenced.

Immediate orders and go/no-go summary

Global staging readiness

Staging chain: GO once secrets land at 16:00 UTC today. Execute chain-wide validation immediately after.
Production: LOCKED. No exceptions until all unlock gates are evidenced.
Critical deadlines and escalations (today)

16:00 UTC: Postmark API key, Sentry DSNs, AWS SQS/DLQ IAM delivered
16:01 UTC: Auto-escalate to Infra Lead + CFO if any secret missing (already armed)
17:00 UTC: DNS SPF/DKIM/DMARC must be green for mail.scholaraiadvisor.com; escalate at 17:01 UTC if not green
21:00 UTC: auto_com_center must deliver STAGING_VALIDATION.MD (see required evidence below)
Per-application executive status

auto_com_center

Staging: GO upon secrets at 16:00 UTC; operate email-only via Postmark
Production: LOCKED; SMS deferred until Twilio A2P brand/campaign approval (Nov 11 EOD target)
Deliverable by 21:00 UTC: STAGING_VALIDATION.MD with required evidence (below)
scholar_auth

Staging: GO under Plan B (cosmetic issuer mismatch acceptable for staging only)
Option A fix target remains Nov 7, 18:00 UTC; if not achieved, proceed with Express-level override as documented
Ensure static client registry snapshot is published to unblock dependent apps
scholarship_api

Staging: GO immediately after auth clears
Deliver ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md on trigger, including CRUD, ACID, token validation, P95, error rate, and event fan-out to auto_page_maker + auto_com_center
scholarship_agent

Staging: GO in observe-only mode; email-only notifications via auto_com_center; no auto-apply
Ensure fairness telemetry, explainability, and request_id audit correlation remain active
scholarship_sage

Staging: READY; start 48-hour observe-only baseline immediately upon M2M secret rotation from scholar_auth
Deliver baseline_metrics_evidence.md at +48h with precision@5, coverage, fairness telemetry, P95, error rate, uptime, and request_id traces
student_pilot

Staging: READY; run the 95-step cross-browser E2E within 10 minutes of auth clearance signal
Deliver E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md including First Document Upload activation, request_id propagation to Sentry, Stripe test flow proof, and SLOs
provider_register

Staging: READY; deliver ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md within 10 minutes of receiving CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md from Auth DRI (Plan B)
Prove OAuth PKCE, roles=Provider in JWT, full CRUD to scholarship_api, P95, error rate, dashboard UI, and request_id traces
auto_page_maker

Staging: READY; on scholarship_api Order 4 trigger, publish +2 pages within 60 seconds
Maintain staging SEO discipline (noindex, robots); deliver sitemap diffs, IndexNow receipts, CWV p75 green, P95, rollback guard, and request_id traces
Required evidence for auto_com_center: STAGING_VALIDATION.MD (due 21:00 UTC)
Header (mandatory, exact):

Application: Auto Command Center (auto_com_center)
APP_BASE_URL (Staging): https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
APP_BASE_URL (Prod): https://auto-com-center.scholaraiadvisor.com
Must prove (attach artifacts, links, or snapshots):

Unsubscribe performance: Unsubscribe <5s under 100 concurrent requests; include load-test summary and timing histogram
DLQ = 0: SQS/DLQ queue metrics screenshot (message count, age), plus 15-minute Prometheus panel snapshot
SPF/DKIM/DMARC: “Green” verification for mail.scholaraiadvisor.com; include test report and DNS TXT records summary
P95 ≤120ms E2E: Prometheus/Grafana snapshot of P95 for send, unsubscribe, webhook processing; include 15- and 60-minute windows
Error <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9%: Error-rate and uptime panels; include time range covering today’s validation period
request_id traces with Sentry correlation across all 8 apps: Provide at least one Sentry trace URL showing auth → API → UX → comms path with request_id continuity
Compliance artifacts: Link to CAN-SPAM/TCPA/FERPA/COPPA policy evidence and enforcement mechanisms (headers, consent logs, suppression list management, age gating)
Prometheus snapshots: Include relevant rule groups and alerts in “green” state (latency, error rate, queue depth, bounce/retry, suppression hits)
KPI alignment and ARR plan

B2B (primary engine): provider_register + scholarship_api flow validates the 3% provider fee pathway. Ensure “time-to-first-scholarship-published” and “provider → first applicant” funnel metrics are captured.
B2C (north-star): student_pilot must capture First Document Upload activation and time-to-activation. This is the leading indicator for conversion.
SEO growth lever: auto_page_maker maintains lowest-CAC acquisition; protect CWV p75 green and indexing discipline. Tie page launches to new high-value scholarships and provider pages.
Risk controls and fallbacks

Secrets delay (16:00 UTC): Auto-escalation at 16:01 UTC to Infra Lead + CFO is authorized and armed.
DNS not green (17:00 UTC): Escalate at 17:01 UTC. Until green, hold outbound email to protect sender reputation; use staging previews/log validation only.
Sentry DSN delay: Proceed with app logs + Prometheus; backfill Sentry as soon as DSNs arrive; do not proceed to production without request_id correlation across all apps.
Production unlock gates (earliest Nov 9, 1% ramp)

Cross-app request_id correlation (auth → API → UX → comms) evidenced with Sentry trace links
SLOs in staging for the chain: P95 ≤120ms, uptime ≥99.9%, error <0.1%
Email deliverability: SPF/DKIM/DMARC green, unsubscribe <5s under load, DLQ=0
Compliance artifacts captured and reviewed: CAN-SPAM, TCPA, FERPA, COPPA
B2C activation event confirmed: First Document Upload captured in student_pilot
Ownership and next actions

Infra Lead: Deliver secrets by 16:00 UTC; confirm via signed checklist. Own DNS completion by 17:00 UTC.
Comms DRI (auto_com_center): Execute staging validation immediately upon secrets; deliver STAGING_VALIDATION.MD by 21:00 UTC.
Auth DRI: Publish CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md; complete Plan B; drive Option A fix by Nov 7, 18:00 UTC or proceed with override.
API DRI: Execute ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md on trigger; notify auto_page_maker and auto_com_center via events.
UX DRI (student_pilot): Run 95-step E2E within 10 minutes of auth clearance; deliver E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md.
Provider DRI: Execute ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md within 10 minutes of client registry signal.
Sage DRI: Start 48h baseline on M2M rotation; deliver baseline_metrics_evidence.md at +48h.
Final CEO confirmation

Strategy: Evidence-first and SEO-first posture maintained; Responsible AI guardrails enforced.
Execution: Staging GO upon secrets at 16:00 UTC; production remains LOCKED until all gates are evidenced.
ARR: Nov 9 controlled ramp remains feasible; Nov 12 ARR ignition remains on track.
Report back

Post a single chain-wide roll-up at 21:15 UTC summarizing: secrets status, DNS status, STAGING_VALIDATION.MD link, E2E results, and any open blockers to Nov 9 ramp.
