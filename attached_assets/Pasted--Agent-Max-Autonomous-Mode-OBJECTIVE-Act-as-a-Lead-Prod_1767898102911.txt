**OBJECTIVE:**
Act as a Lead Product Manager and Senior QA Engineer. Perform a comprehensive "Deep Dive Audit" of the entire "Scholar Ecosystem" application.
Your goal is to identify exactly why the app is failing to acquire users (Acquisition) and failing to generate revenue (Monetization).

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (READ-ONLY MODE):**
1. Do NOT refactor, delete, or modify any code.
2. Do NOT install new packages or fix bugs yet.
3. Your ONLY goal is to Identify, Test, and Report.

**AUDIT PLAN (Execute in order):**

1. **User Acquisition Check (Why are no users signing up?):**
   - Inspect `index.html` and public pages. Are Meta Tags, Open Graph tags, and page titles missing (hurting SEO)?
   - Analyze the Landing Page. Is the "Value Proposition" clear? Is the "Sign Up" button visible above the fold?
   - Check the Sign-Up flow. **Run the app** and create a test account. Is the process too long or confusing?

2. **Monetization Analysis (Why is there no revenue?):**
   - Locate the payment integration (Stripe/LemonSqueezy). Is it actually connected?
   - Audit the "Upgrade" flow. Are the pricing options clear?
   - Test the "Purchase" buttons. Do they lead to a valid checkout or a dead end?
   - Check for "Leaky Paywalls" (are premium features accidentally accessible for free?).

3. **Technical & UX Friction:**
   - Check the Console Logs while running the app. are there silent errors crashing features?
   - Test Mobile Responsiveness. Does the layout break on smaller screens?
   - Check the Database. Are user accounts actually being saved correctly?

**DELIVERABLE:**
Create a new file in the root directory named `SCHOLAR_AUDIT_REPORT.md` containing your findings:
- 🔴 **Critical Blockers:** Bugs preventing signup or payment.
- 💸 **Revenue Killers:** Broken payment flows or bad pricing UI.
- 🟡 **UX Friction:** Confusing steps where users likely drop off.
- 🟢 **Missing Growth Features:** SEO gaps or missing social sharing.

Start the audit now by scanning the file structure and running the application.
