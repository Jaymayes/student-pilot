CEO Executive Directive — 2025-11-07, ~18:20 UTC

Prime decisions

GO to proceed with tonight’s plan as scoped. scholarship_agent remains frozen and excluded from all flows through Nov 9.
Yes: Proceed now with testing the OAuth flows for student_pilot and provider_register to capture protected-route redirect evidence and PKCE S256 proof. Evidence must include Application Name and APP_BASE_URL at the top of each report.
Critical risk and required mitigations before the 00:00 UTC AUTH GREEN TAG

Auth latency YELLOW (P95 ~200ms vs ≤120ms target). This remains a hard gate. Mandate the following optimizations immediately (owner: Auth DRI):
Pre-warm and keep-warm: token endpoint and discovery endpoints. Run steady 30–50 RPS synthetic traffic for 10 minutes to stabilize JIT/connection pools.
Enable/verify connection pooling and HTTP keep-alive between dependent apps and scholar_auth; raise pool size to match expected concurrent flows during gate tests.
Cache controls:
In-memory cache for .well-known/openid-configuration (TTL ≥300s).
In-memory cache for JWKS (TTL ≥300s) with proactive refresh 60s before expiry.
Reduce overhead in token issuance path:
Avoid synchronous logging and expensive JSON stringification in hot path; shift to structured, buffered logs.
Ensure hashing/crypto libs use hardware-accelerated primitives available in the runtime.
Optimize DB/secret lookups (if any) on token path: preload client metadata; no per-request disk/env reads.
Re-run load to confirm P95 ≤120ms for:
POST /oauth/token (auth code + client_credentials)
GET /.well-known/openid-configuration
GET /jwks.json
Contingency if P95 still >120ms at 23:45 UTC:
00:00 gate slips up to 30 minutes while mitigation continues.
If P95 remains >120ms at 00:15 UTC, NO-GO for AUTH GREEN TAG; reschedule gate by 24 hours with written postmortem + fix plan by 02:00 UTC.
War-room cadence and ownership (all artifacts must start with Application Name + APP_BASE_URL)

19:15 UTC pre-war-room smoke: Confirm Track 1 evidence is reproducible and latency trending down.
20:00 UTC war-room open; 30-minute checkpoints; Auth DRI owns latency track-down; Sage DRI stands by for M2M validations; API DRI monitors validation continuity.
23:30–23:45 UTC JWKS rotation rehearsal: Success means zero validation errors across all apps; rollback plan documented and tested. API DRI to watch 401/5xx spike alarms.
Immediate execution orders

Auth DRI
Complete Track 2 discovery fix and PKCE S256 enforcement validation.
Execute latency mitigations listed above; post metrics snapshots every 20 minutes (P50/P95, error rate, throughput).
Produce AUTH_FIXLOG_2025-11-07.md by 00:00 UTC including:
Discovery evidence (authorization_code + client_credentials).
PKCE S256 enforcement with redacted logs.
Token lifecycle (mint/refresh/revoke).
JWKS rotation rehearsal results.
Performance: P95 ≤120ms target across endpoints; error ≤1%; availability ≥99.9%.
Sage DRI
Track 1 M2M bypass: Confirmed complete. Maintain green status; re-run 3-grant sequence after auth optimizations to verify latency improvement and attach fresh timings.
Ensure read-only scopes enforced; keep evidence current.
student_pilot DRI
Upon AUTH GREEN TAG, execute full E2E and post E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md by 00:30 UTC:
Registration/login redirect proof (protected-route redirects to scholar_auth).
Profile submission to scholarship_api (200s; request_id lineage).
Interaction with scholarship_sage (contextual advice call evidence).
PKCE S256 proof with redacted auth logs.
P95 ≤120ms for all critical API calls (≥20 requests).
provider_register DRI
Execute ORDER_B between 00:00–01:00 UTC; post ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md by 01:00 UTC:
Provider creation → scholarship publish → dashboard view.
3% platform fee visibility evidence.
PKCE S256 proof; request_id lineage across provider_register → scholar_auth → scholarship_api.
P95 ≤120ms (≥20 requests).
scholarship_api DRI
Within 1 hour of E2E completion (target ~01:30 UTC), post ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md addendum:
Cross-app traces for PKCE (student_pilot, provider_register) and M2M (scholarship_sage).
Strict token validation proof; scope enforcement.
P95 ≤120ms; error budget ≤1%; availability ≥99.9%.
Monitor during JWKS rehearsal for seamless key rollover.
auto_com_center DRI
Deliver DELIVERABILITY_SNAPSHOT_2025-11-07.md by 00:00 UTC:
Inbox placement ≥95%, bounce <5%, complaint <0.1%.
SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment proof.
Production templates (student + provider) staged; end-to-end send tests attached.
Answer to question/next step

Yes—proceed to test OAuth flows for student_pilot and provider_register now to capture protected-route redirect evidence and PKCE S256 proof. Ensure each report starts with the correct Application Name and APP_BASE_URL, includes request_id lineage, redacts all PII/secrets, and attaches latency distributions (P50/P95) for token and API calls.
KPI capture aligned to ARR plan

B2C: First Document Upload activation rate; time-to-activation; auth→token→API funnel success.
B2B: ORDER_B completion rate; publish-to-dashboard P95 latency.
Auth: P95 latency on token and discovery; 401/5xx rates; availability.
Platform: Availability ≥99.9% during 20:00–01:00 UTC; error ≤1%.
Stop-the-line criteria (unchanged)

P95 >120ms sustained 10 minutes on any critical path.
Error rate >1% over 5-minute rolling window.
Token issuance/validation failures >0.5% over 10 minutes.
JWKS rotation causes validation failures.
ARR ignition and scope confirmations

ARR ignition earliest dates remain tied to:
B2C upsell readiness (student_pilot): post-GREEN TAG + 48 hours of stable metrics.
B2B fee capture (provider_register): confirmation of 3% fee transparency and settlement path in evidence.
scholarship_agent remains frozen through Nov 9; observe-only; no references in tonight’s flows.
auto_page_maker stays frozen, observer role, daily 06:00 UTC rollups continue.
Reporting hygiene

Every artifact must begin with Application Name and APP_BASE_URL.
Use request_id lineage in all cross-app evidence.
Redact PII; no secrets in logs; all credentials via Replit Secrets.
I will render a GO/NO-GO at 00:00 UTC based on the evidence package and the auth latency remediation results. Maintain urgency; post intermediate metrics every 20 minutes to the war-room channel.
