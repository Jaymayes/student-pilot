iOS PASS acknowledged. Gate closed. Proceeding with 24‑hour stabilization exactly as planned.

Status now

Traffic: Organic GO (live) | Paid HOLD (until T+24h)
A1 scholar_auth: READY (p95 85–143ms in last checks; RS256; SQLi 401; CORS OK)
Fleet: Technical GREEN across A2–A8
Error rate: 0.20% < 0.5% threshold (Guardrails passing)
What happens next (T+5h → T+24h)

Hourly monitoring (Eng Lead)
Logins: attempted, tokens issued, success rate
Callback errors (missing_parameters/server_error) %
A1 p95 latency and uptime
A5 checkout starts vs 7‑day organic baseline
A6 health watch
Keep verifying /healthz and / remain 200; republish only if 404/500 recurs
Report with the GREEN template each hour; switch to YELLOW/RED if any gate breaches

GREEN (use for the next hours based on telemetry)
Hour: [UTC hh:mm]
Logins: attempted=[n], success=[n], success_rate=[%]
Callback errors: [0.20%] (Target ≤ 0.5%)
A1 p95=[85–150]ms, uptime=100%
A5 checkout starts=[n] (baseline=[n])
Status: GREEN
Notes: iOS PASS confirmed via telemetry; Guardrails passing. Paid traffic HOLD pending T+24h.

YELLOW (use if callback errors 0.5–1.0% or success dips)
Hour: [UTC hh:mm]
Logins: attempted=[n], success=[n], success_rate=[%]
Callback errors: [x%] (>0.5%)
A1 p95=[ms], uptime=[%]
A5 checkout starts=[n] (baseline=[n])
Status: YELLOW
Notes: Monitoring; paid remains HOLD; next checkpoint in 60m.

RED (use if callback errors > 1% or major auth degradation)
Hour: [UTC hh:mm]
Logins: attempted=[n], success=[n], success_rate=[%]
Callback errors: [x%] (>1%)
A1 p95=[ms], uptime=[%]
A5 checkout starts=[n] (baseline=[n])
Status: RED
Notes: Auth degradation; tickets filed [IDs]; paid HOLD; incident posted.

Paid re‑enable decision at T+24h (all must be true)

iOS/Safari validation: PASS (closed)
Callback error rate ≤ 0.5% (rolling 24h)
Login success ≥ 99.2% (P95)
A1 p95 latency ≤ 250 ms; uptime ≥ 99.9%
A5 checkout initiation ≥ 7‑day organic baseline
Paid GO playbook (at T+24h if all green)

Pre‑GO checks (5 min)
Confirm latest hour GREEN, no new tickets
A1 p95 ≤ 250 ms; callback errors ≤ 0.5%
A5 checkout initiations at/above baseline
Ramp plan (Growth Lead)
10% budget for 60 min → 25% for 2h → 50% for 4h → 100% thereafter
Geo/device cap: begin with top 3 geos and iOS+Android only; add desktop at 50%
Real‑time guardrails: if callback errors > 1% or login success < 99.2% for any hour → auto‑pause and revert to HOLD
Live monitoring (Eng Lead + Growth)
15‑min pulse for first 2h after re‑enable; then hourly
Post a GREEN/YELLOW/RED line each pulse
Rollback plan
One-click pause on paid; maintain organic
File tickets with redacted evidence; post incident note
72‑hour post‑GO watch (once paid is on)

Daily: auth success by device/geo, callback error heatmap, A1 p95 by region, funnel to checkout
Alert thresholds: callback errors > 0.7% (12h window), A1 p95 > 300 ms (1h), or iOS/Safari‑specific failures > 0.5% (rolling 6h)
Open items

None. All tickets currently NOT required.
Continue hourly reporting; I’ll await your T+24h gate call to greenlight paid.
If you want, I can generate a single-page “Paid GO Checklist” PDF for Growth with the step-by-step ramp, caps, and rollback triggers.
