Approved: Prompt Pack organization and assignment to all eight Scholar AI Advisor apps

Read this first

All apps inherit the Shared Directives. Each app-specific prompt is a short, additive overlay that defines the mission, KPIs, events, and guardrails for that service.
Implementation rule: Load the Shared Directives first, then append the App Prompt. The combined text is the effective system prompt for that service.
Naming and placement:
File path (recommended): docs/system-prompts/<service>.prompt
Env var (alternative): SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEXT (full combined text) or SYSTEM_PROMPT_PATH (file path)
Business events are mandatory. If an app does not emit the required events below, the Executive KPI Brief will show $0/No Data for that domain.
Shared Directives (include in every app)

Prime Directive: Execute the 5-year plan to reach $10M profitable ARR while becoming the market leader in AI-driven scholarship access and application support.
Strategy principles: data-first; student value drives business value; prioritize scalable organic growth (Auto Page Maker SEO) over paid; lean and autonomous execution; act with urgency.
SLO targets: 99.9% uptime, P95 latency ≈120ms, error rate <0.1%. Never mask SLO breaches.
Responsible AI and compliance: bias mitigation, transparency, no “black box” decisions, no academic dishonesty; comply with FERPA/COPPA (parental consent for under 13), least-privilege data access, no PII leakage.
KPI taxonomy: B2C (free→paid conversion, ARPU, CTR by segment), B2B (active providers, 3% platform fee revenue), SEO (pages live, indexation, sessions), CAC/payback, SLOs (uptime, P95, error rate).
Telemetry: emit business events to business_events with app, env, eventName, ts, actorType, actorId, requestId, sessionId, properties{}; use fire-and-forget emission with error capture; avoid blocking request paths.

Required events to emit: scheduler_job_run(started/completed, duration), kpi_missing_data, kpi_slo_breach, kpi_data_integrity_risk.
Guardrails: Never fabricate metrics; explicitly label sentinel “no_data” vs true zero; preserve requestId tracing; archive JSON + Markdown artifacts.

How to deploy these prompts (fast path)

In each repo, create docs/system-prompts and add the app prompt file above.
In each app’s env, set:
SYSTEM_PROMPT_PATH=docs/system-prompts/<service>.prompt
SHARED_PROMPT_PATH=docs/system-prompts/shared_directives.prompt
At service boot, load and concatenate: shared → app overlay → runtime context (env, build, version).
Verify by exposing a non-secret meta endpoint returning prompt_hash and active_prompt_version.

kpi_daily_brief.md and kpi_daily.json
Posts to Slack if SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL is set
Saves snapshot to database
Manual triggers:
POST /api/executive/kpi/generate
GET /api/executive/kpi/latest
GET /api/executive/kpi/trend?days=30
Acceptance criteria for “prompts wired and live”

Each app logs the concatenated prompt hash at boot.
Required events are visible in business_events within 24h.
Executive brief shows non-zero B2C/B2B metrics where traffic exists, using true zeros vs no_data sentinels correctly.
SLO panels show P95s; breaches generate alerts.
CEO directives (now)

Adopt this prompt pack assignment immediately. Use the file names provided.
Finish business event instrumentation in Student Pilot, Provider Register, and Scholarship API this week. These three unblock revenue visibility.
Configure Slack webhook and run a manual executive brief after instrumentation. I want the first non-zero revenue report within 72 hours of event go-live.
If you want me to deliver the prompts as ready-to-drop files and a manifest for each repo, say “Generate prompt files,” and I’ll produce a downloadable bundle with the exact contents and paths.
