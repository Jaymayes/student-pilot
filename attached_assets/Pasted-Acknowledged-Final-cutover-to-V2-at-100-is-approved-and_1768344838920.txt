Acknowledged. Final cutover to V2 at 100% is approved and logged. Golden Record ZT3G_GOLDEN_20260114_039 accepted. Excellent execution.

Executive directives for the 24h hypercare window

Guardrails stay ON: FREEZE_LOCK=1, SEO-only acquisition, spend caps enforced, auto-rollback on Sev‑1 or P95 > 110ms for 30+ minutes.
Reporting cadence:
T+2h: stability snapshot (SLOs, error histogram), Stripe auth/capture/refunds, payout utilization, verifier FP, cost velocity, top-5 slow endpoints.
T+6h: include decision recommendation on payout cap raise.
T+24h: “Mission Accomplished” packet and go/no-go on resuming limited paid traffic.
Provider payouts

Decision window: T+6h.
Conditions to raise per‑provider daily cap to $250 (CFO approval required):
auth/capture ≥ 98.5% last 6h
refunds ≤ 3% and disputes = 0
fraud signals < 0.5%
platform fee accrual tracked; reserve (10% holdback) intact
If green, request CFO token CFO-20260114-PAYOUT-RAISE-250 (consumption requires the four checks above plus incident‑free status).
Paid acquisition policy (after 24h only if green)

Default: remain paused; organic SEO is our CAC advantage.
If T+24h is fully green, authorize a tightly capped retargeting pilot:
Budget: $150/day max for 72h, CAC hard ceiling $12, target ARPU > CAC x 1.5 within 7 days.
If ceiling breached for 24h, auto‑pause.
Next 72 hours: priorities and success targets

Stability
SLO: P95 ≤ 110ms, error ≤ 0.5%, uptime ≥ 99.9%.
Verifier FP ≤ 1.0% sustained; self‑correction ≥ 90%.
Revenue
B2C: 4x markup maintained; ARPU ≥ $20 on credit buyers; refund rate ≤ 5%.
B2B: provider fee at 3%; 20 new provider signups; ≥10 new listings live.
Gross margin on AI services ≥ 60% daily.
Growth (SEO)
Auto Page Maker: +1,000 pages indexed net over 72h; CTR and indexed-to-click ratio tracked daily.
Funnel health (SEO traffic)
Visitor→Signup ≥ 7%
Signup→First Upload ≥ 35%
First Upload→Paid ≥ 7%
Compliance/Security
0 PII in logs; 100% DoNotSell enforcement for minors; 100% X‑API‑Key on inter‑service calls.
Complete a mini‑privacy audit and key-rotation confirmation post-cutover.
Operational instructions

Retire V1 completely after a 7‑day read‑only observation window; schedule archival and access controls.
Rotate all inter‑service API keys again at T+24h and invalidate legacy keys.
Open a performance workstream on the top 5 slow endpoints with before/after profiles; target 20% latency reduction.
Risk watchlist and mitigations

Disputes/fraud: auto‑pause provider payouts on any provider breaching 1% refund/dispute; manual review within 4 hours.
SEO volatility: keep publishing velocity steady; do not change page templates during the first 72h.
Cost control: alert at 80% of LLM/API spend cap; throttle non-revenue tasks first.
What I need from you

T+2h 100% stability report per above.
T+6h recommendation on payout cap raise (include Stripe metrics, refunds/disputes per provider, reserve balance).
T+24h “Mission Accomplished” packet with: SLOs, revenue by stream (B2C credits/B2B provider fees), ARPU, margins, CAC (should remain near-organic), SEO indexing growth, incident summary, and compliance attestations.
Stay disciplined on organic growth and unit economics. This cutover positions us to scale toward the $10M ARR objective with a low-CAC engine and verifiable quality.
