As CEO, here are my executive decisions, based on the evidence actually available to me and aligned to our 5‑year plan and KPI model.

Context I am using

Our strategic plan prioritizes a low‑CAC, SEO‑led B2C acquisition engine that feeds a B2B marketplace where revenue is concentrated; student activation is driven by “first document upload,” and B2B ARR is the primary lever to $10M+ ARR. These are the decision guardrails for go/no‑go and capital allocation .
For deployment posture and operating model, I am applying Replit’s deployment best practices (Autoscale vs Reserved VM), with Reserved VM only for always‑on workers and queues, and strict cost guardrails for everything else .
Agent autonomy is useful but must remain under HOTL governance; we will not accept “black‑box” behavior. Reliability, self‑healing patterns, and auditability are mandatory before scale .
Immediate scope correction and DRI assignments

One DRI per app. You are accountable for your app’s Section V report and evidence bundle. Agents may support each other, but accountability is singular.
Submit all Section V reports and artifacts into a single shared evidence root so the exec team can review without ambiguity.
Where your summary cites files (e.g., e2e/reports/... or seo/daily_rollup/...), those files are not visible in the materials I have. You must attach them in our evidence root to be considered.
Executive decisions: Go/No‑Go per application
Note: Status is based on evidence I can see. If you’ve already produced it, attach it now so I can upgrade a conditional decision.

APPLICATION NAME: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: GO-LIVE READY, FROZEN through Nov 12 (affirmed)
Conditions and directives:

Continue freeze to protect SEO flywheel and CAC advantage; this aligns to our strategy where SEO is the primary, lowest‑CAC engine feeding B2C/B2B funnels .
Required by 12:00 UTC today: attach seo/daily_rollup/2025-11-10.md (and 11‑08, 11‑09) and the production readiness proofs you referenced.
No changes to templates, sitemap, or infra until freeze lifts.
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: CONDITIONAL GO under 48‑hour performance remediation
Conditions and directives:

Required evidence bundle within T+30 and T+48 checkpoints: P50/P95 per endpoint, JWKS and OIDC discovery proofs, token revocation proof, and no‑PII logging samples.
Target SLO: P95 ≤120ms, error rate ≤0.1%. HOTL governance enforced (no black‑box auth) .
If SLO is not met by the 48‑hour gate, dependent apps remain conditional.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: CONDITIONAL GO
Conditions and directives:

Metrics you cited (P95 well under 120ms, 0% error rate) are promising; attach ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md and performance histograms so I can convert to full GO.
This API is foundational to B2C activation and B2B provider ops; it must remain rules‑based and explainable, with audit trails and request_id lineage for compliance and BI .
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: DELAYED pending 3 gates
Blocking gates and directives:

Pre‑soak PASS + T+30 evidence: attach by 03:15 UTC.
Stripe PASS: finance gate required to monetize credits (4× AI markup).
Deliverability GREEN (auto_com_center). If deliverability is not GREEN, we can still allow SSO and in‑app notifications at launch, but payment and email‑based loops must be clearly flagged as deferred.
Rationale: student_pilot drives “first document upload” activation and B2C monetization; launching without Stripe would undermine ARR ignition against our plan .
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: CONDITIONAL GO to “waitlist mode”; full GO when Stripe and comms pass
Conditions and directives:

Provide Section V report you referenced and attach proofs for RBAC, OIDC, and 3% fee flows.
Providers are our primary ARR engine long‑term; accelerate once Stripe + deliverability gates are green, in line with the B2B‑led path to $10M+ ARR .
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: PARTIAL GO (Queues only). Email delivery: DELAYED
Conditions and directives:

Proceed with queue worker on a small Reserved VM (always‑on), which matches our deployment guidance for persistent workers and gives predictable cost/perf .
Block outbound email until Postmark domain verification and DNS (SPF/DMARC/DKIM) complete. Attach your “RESERVED_VM_MIGRATION_PLAN.md” and an ops runbook with alerting.
Deadline: DNS and verification by T0+24h; if missed, student_pilot launch proceeds without email, using in‑app notifications.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: GO-LIVE READY in observer/frozen mode
Directives:

Maintain observe‑only posture and daily fairness telemetry; no autonomous actions without HOTL approval. This preserves responsible‑AI governance while we stabilize launch .
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: GO-LIVE READY in observer/frozen mode
Directives:

Operate as BI/analytics and insights layer only. No changes during freeze. Ensure dashboards reflect activation, conversion, ARPU, and provider funnel KPIs per Playbook V2.0 baselines .
Unblocking actions I am authorizing now

Infra: Provision Reserved VM for auto_com_center queue worker (1 vCPU/1GB RAM) and execute DNS for Postmark today; this is the only paid infra change I’m approving now because it supports essential comms and aligns to “always‑on worker” guidance .
Finance: Complete Stripe PASS today. No payments = no ARR ignition for B2C.
DRIs: Upload all cited artifacts to the central evidence root. My decisions will move from “Conditional” to “Go” only upon receipt.
ARR ignition plan and dates

B2C ARR ignition: Provisional 2025‑11‑11 16:00 UTC, contingent on student_pilot pre‑soak PASS + T+30, and Stripe PASS. If auto_com_center email is still DELAYED, we proceed with SSO + in‑app notifications and clearly note email deferral in the Section V appendix.
B2B ARR ignition: Open provider waitlist now; full provider onboarding when Stripe + deliverability are green, in line with the plan to accelerate B2B as our primary driver to $10M+ ARR .
Governance and evidence requirements

Single source of truth: Each app DRI must deliver a Section V report with the required evidence bundle. Autonomous agents may assist, but human DRIs are accountable. Reliability and auditability precede scale; this is non‑negotiable .
Minimum evidence per app: SLO metrics (uptime, P50/P95, error rate), security controls (TLS 1.3, RBAC, no‑PII logging), DR plan, integration proofs (OIDC/JWKS as applicable), and rollback steps. For workers/queues, include Reserved VM configs and alerting runbooks .
Data‑first: No further go‑decisions will be made on assertions alone. Attach the artifacts you referenced so we can credit the work.
Summary CEO call

Today’s priority is unlocking Stripe and deliverability while protecting our SEO flywheel. This keeps CAC low, activates B2C monetization, and readies the B2B provider funnel—the clearest path to $10M+ ARR per our updated model .
I’ll convert the CONDITIONAL decisions above to full GO on receipt of the missing artifacts and gate passes. Maintain urgency and HOTL discipline.
