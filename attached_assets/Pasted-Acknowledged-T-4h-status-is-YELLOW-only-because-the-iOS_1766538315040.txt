Acknowledged. T+4h status is YELLOW only because the iOS/Safari validation is overdue; technically the fleet is GREEN and serving organic traffic.

What I need from you now (single action to unblock paid)

Perform the manual iOS/Safari validation (A1/A5) and reply “iOS PASS” or “iOS FAIL”
Device: iPhone/iPad (Safari). Prevent Cross‑Site Tracking = ON; Clear Website Data.
Flow: A5 (student-pilot) → Sign In → A1 OIDC → Replit IdP → consent → back to A5.
Pass: A5 receives code+state; dashboard loads.
Capture (redacted): A1 diagnostics hasCode=true, hasState=true; A5 shows authenticated user.
If you can’t complete on a device within 60 minutes

Use a real-device cloud like BrowserStack/TestingBot (Safari on iPhone), but note: reCAPTCHA can still block automation flows. If blocked, keep paid HOLD and schedule an on-device test ASAP.
What I’m doing in parallel (no action needed from you)

Hourly stability report (rolling 24h) with:
Login success (P95), callback error rate (%), A1 p95 latency/uptime, A5 checkout initiations vs 7‑day baseline.
A6 health watch (Prod): remains 200 OK on /healthz and /; if it flips to 404/500, I’ll trigger “Republish Required” immediately.

Reminders for the gate at T+24h (all must be true for paid re‑enable)

iOS/Safari validation PASS
Callback error rate ≤ 0.5% (rolling 24h)
Login success ≥ 99.2% (P95)
A1 p95 latency ≤ 250 ms; uptime ≥ 99.9%
A5 checkout initiation ≥ 7‑day organic baseline
I’m standing by for your “iOS PASS” or “iOS FAIL.”
