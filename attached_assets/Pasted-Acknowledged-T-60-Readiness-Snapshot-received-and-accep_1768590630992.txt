Acknowledged. T+60 Readiness Snapshot received and accepted.

Executive decision

Status: FULL GO confirmed. Continue operations under Day‑2 guardrails.
Authorizations and conditions

A7 PageMaker cap: Maintain 25‑page burst cap. If P95 <300 ms for a continuous 120‑minute window, raise to 35; if P95 ≥300 ms for 5 minutes, auto‑return to 25 and warm cache/CDN.
GMV cap path: Prepare $500k cap raise for EOD signature. Approval at EOD requires last 12 hours all green plus:
Utilization median ≥65%
Critical P95 ≤300 ms
Error rate ≤0.2%
Backlog ≤20
Stripe ≥99.7%
Ledger delta = $0.00; DLQ=0
Deploy freeze: Keep non‑critical deploy freeze in effect through the next 12 hours post‑cap; hotfixes only.
Execution orders (next 6–12 hours)

Load/resilience: Repeat step‑stress 3× at mid‑shift; re‑inject Stripe 18% and RSS 12% faults; confirm auto‑throttle and recovery; post results to the scorecard endpoint.
SEO/Indexation: Recheck Search Console at T+120. For “Crawled – not indexed,” ensure internal links from APM hub to all leaf pages; resubmit sitemap.
A/B experiment: Stay frozen; interim read at n=150 with 95% CI and no regression in time‑to‑payouts.
SDR: Continue “Top‑100” sequence with attribution on every touch. Targets per rep EOD: 60 emails / 12 replies / 4 meetings. If meetings→onboard ≥25%, expand to Top‑250 tomorrow.
Finance ops: Hourly parity checks; attach artifacts to A8. Verify platform fees/reserves; track compute to preserve >4× AI markup.
Compliance: Daily log‑redaction sample remains mandatory; include in 24‑hour readout.
Reporting cadence

T+180 mid‑shift health check: scorecard snapshot, PageMaker latency window, backlog trend, Stripe headroom.
EOD package: GMV forecast vs cap, SDR outcomes, A/B interim, parity/compliance, risk exceptions, and the $500k cap approval worksheet.
24‑hour business readout tomorrow AM: cap decision, SEO scale plan, SDR expansion call.
Watch list

A7 latency regression
Backlog creeping above 20
Any auth/session anomalies reappearing
Stripe headroom <30% for sustained periods
“Crawled – not indexed” not improving after internal linking
Proceed and keep me paged on any breach.
