Executive decision: GO for auto_com_center production publish now.

Owner and timing

Directly responsible individual: auto_com_center DRI
Action: Click Publish in Replit now
SLA: Confirm “Published” status in the war-room within 5 minutes of this directive
Scope and constraints (must be applied)

Mode: Dry-run only for the first 48 hours (no promotional sends; transactional templates permitted in dry-run)
Feature flags/env: DISABLE_SEND=true; PROMO_SENDS=false; RETRIES_ENABLED=true; RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
Security posture: Enforce JWT validation on all inbound events; no bypasses. If scholar_auth Gate 1 is not yet GREEN, service must remain in “receive-and-queue” mode (no dispatch) until JWKS validation passes
Observability: Enable request/queue metrics, error budget tracking, and structured logs at INFO; elevate to WARN on delivery failures
Post-publish verification (deliver evidence bundle in 15 minutes)
Run your prepared script and attach artifacts. Minimum checks:

/canary (v2.7) returns 8 fields; security headers present (6/6); P95 ≤ 120 ms with 30-sample baseline
Auth/JWKS reachability check to scholar_auth (note: if Gate 1 not GREEN, document as “degraded – pending Gate 1” and rerun on flip)
M2M token flow (happy-path) for SystemService role from scholarship_agent (document expected block if Gate 1 not GREEN)
Event ingestion: Post two synthetic events (deadline_soon and new_match) → verify they land in the queue; render templates in dry-run; no external sends
Delivery providers: Health checks to Email/SMTP and SMS gateway in dry-run; verify credential scopes and throttling
Kill-switch validation: Confirm DISABLE_SEND toggles message dispatch off within 60 seconds
Production guardrails (first 48 hours)

No promotional campaigns; transactional-only in dry-run
A/B testing off
Concurrency cap to 10 msgs/minute; backoff with jitter enabled
DLQ retention ≥ 72 hours; dead-letter ratio target < 0.5%
Monitor SLOs: uptime ≥ 99.9%, 5xx < 0.5%, P95 ≤ 120 ms, auth success ≥ 98%, queue depth stable
Rollback and pause criteria (any one triggers immediate pause)

5xx ≥ 1% over a rolling 5-minute window
JWT validation failures ≥ 2% on inbound events over 5 minutes
Queue depth > 2x baseline for 10 consecutive minutes
P95 latency > 300 ms for 5 minutes Actions: Toggle DISABLE_SEND=true, pause consumers, revert to last stable deployment, and post incident note in war-room within 10 minutes
Coordination with platform gates

Independent of Gates 1 and 2 for publish; remain in receive-and-queue and dry-run until Gate 1 (scholar_auth) is GREEN
Once Gate 1 flips GREEN, rerun token validation tests and update evidence bundle
Gate 2 (scholarship_api) does not block comm center publish; do a quick canary pull when it flips GREEN to validate event schema compatibility
War-room updates

T+5 minutes: Publish confirmation + link to build ID
T+15 minutes: Evidence bundle posted; status set to “auto_com_center: GREEN (dry-run)”
Hourly for first 6 hours, then every 4 hours during 48-hour window; earlier if any threshold breach
Rationale tied to Prime Directive

Reliable transactional communications are foundational to trust and conversion in both B2C and B2B funnels. Publishing now in dry-run removes the final blocker to FOC for this component without introducing revenue or compliance risk, while keeping CAC low and protecting our SLOs.
Proceed and report back within the stated SLAs.
