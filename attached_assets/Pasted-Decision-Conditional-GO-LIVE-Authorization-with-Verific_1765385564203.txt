Decision: Conditional GO-LIVE Authorization with Verification Gates

Why (Data/Insight): The ecosystem has achieved technical readiness with 8/8 services reporting online and the "Zero 404" mandate satisfied. However, revenue validation remains theoretical; while the B2B provider_register (A6) and B2C student_pilot (A5) rails are coded, the "Human Latency" risk identified in your logs is critical. We cannot scale the Programmatic SEO engine (A7) or invite provider traffic without confirming the $9.99 credit provisioning logic works in a live environment. The anomalous 99.63% CTR reported by scholarship_agent (A3) suggests potential bot traffic or telemetry errors that must be isolated before paid media spend.


KPI Impact (Estimate):


Revenue: Validating the $9.99 transaction unlocks our path to the Year 1 target of $250k ARR.


Efficiency: Automating the A7 SEO engine aims to lower CAC to <$10  via organic traffic.


Reliability: Enforcing the <120ms latency SLO ensures we meet the "Agentic" user experience standard.

Risks and Mitigations:


SEO Penalty Risk: If A7 pages are indexed before value is verifiable (revenue/tools working), we risk "thin content" penalties from Google. Mitigation: Strict Gate 3 (Revenue Integrity) before sitemap submission.


Compliance Risk: Ensure A6 (Provider) and A5 (Student) flows strictly separate FERPA data from B2C profiles. Mitigation: Verify is_ferpa_covered flags in the database.

Telemetry Risk: The A3 CTR (99.63%) is statistically improbable. Mitigation: Audit A3 click tracking logic immediately.

Next Actions (Owner: Agent3 / Operator):

Immediate: Execute Single-Source-of-Truth Verification (Agent3)

Post a consolidated heartbeat for all eight apps to A8 (auto_com_center).

Provide the A8 readouts for /api/fleet/health and /api/fleet/revenue.

Definitively resolve A7 "noindex" status: Run curl -I on an A7 generated page. Confirm X-Robots-Tag headers are absent or allow indexing only if the revenue gate is passed.

CRITICAL: Execute B2C Test Transaction (Operator)

Path: scholar_auth → student_pilot → "Upgrade to Pro" → Stripe Checkout.

Action: Process a $9.99 transaction using test card 4242 4242 4242 4242.

Verification: Confirm A8 revenue tile increments to ~$11.00 and user credits update.

Go/No-Go Gates for Public Launch:


Gate 1 (Availability): All 8 apps return HTTP 200 at root.

Gate 2 (Integrity): A8 shows 8/8 apps online; last heartbeat <2 mins.

Gate 3 (Revenue): A2 webhook receives signature_verified: true for the $9.99 event.

Gate 4 (Compliance): "Stripe Mode" (TEST/LIVE) is clearly labeled in A8 to prevent accidental charges.

Open Data Gaps/Assumptions:

A3 Anomalies: Investigate the source of the 271 impressions / 270 clicks. Is this internal testing or a bot?


B2B Fee Logic: Confirm the 3% transaction fee logic in A6 is logging provider_id and fee_cents correctly.
