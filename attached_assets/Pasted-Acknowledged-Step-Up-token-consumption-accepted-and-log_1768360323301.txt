Acknowledged. Step‑Up token consumption accepted and logged. Daily budget is $300 (rolling 24h) under retargeting‑only rules. Keep execution tight and data‑first.

Day 2 operating orders (effective now)

Budgeting and pacing
Hard cap: $300/day rolling 24h (no overruns). Smooth pacing (30/30/40 split AM/PM/evening).
Auto‑downshift to $150/day if any 6h moving average breaches: CAC > $10, Stripe success < 98.5% for 30 min, fraud ≥ 0.5%, or refund rate ≥ 4%.
Targeting and frequency
Segments: (1) first‑upload abandoners, (2) checkout/credit cart abandoners, (3) high‑intent essay/transcript viewers.
Frequency caps: ≤ 3 impressions/user/day, ≤ 7/week; suppress converters for 14 days.
Creative/test plan (retain retargeting only)
Budget mix: 70% current winner, 20% challenger, 10% exploratory.
Kill criteria: after ≥ 500 impressions, drop any creative with CTR −30% vs control or CAC +25% vs cohort for 6h; redeploy next challenger.
Landing flows: drive to First Upload and credit‑gate; ensure A8 events for upload_started, upload_completed, credit_purchase.
Guardrails and compliance
Maintain minors’ DoNotSell=true; 0 PII in logs; X‑API‑Key enforcement confirmed daily.
Keep refund p50 ≤ 30s; disputes = 0; fraud < 0.5%.
Performance and cost controls

Maintain P95 ≤ 110ms; error ≤ 0.5%.
Keep search/match caching (60s TTL) through Week 1; review TTL after Friday KPI.
If rolling 24h LLM/API projection > $300 or /documents/analyze queue_depth ≥ 30 or P95 > 1.5s for 15 min, auto‑throttle non‑revenue tasks by 50% and page Ops + Finance.
Provider payouts and ops

Payout caps active at $250/provider, $5,000 global, 10% holdback. Net‑14 still in simulation; CFO go‑live review on Day 7 with disputes=0, fraud < 0.5%, refunds ≤ 3%, Stripe ≥ 98.5%, reconciliation ±$0.
Provider acquisition: hit +20 providers/+60 listings this week; keep 3% fee instrumentation verified.
Forecast (step‑up impact; directional)

At CAC ≤ $8 and ARPU ≈ $25, $300/day should yield 37–40 new purchases/day ($930–$1,000 gross B2C/day), incremental ~$28k–$30k B2C net/month if sustained. Keep weekly forecast updated with actual CAC and ARPU7.
Reporting requirements

Day 2 T+12h and T+24h pilot reports: spend, CAC, ARPU7, funnel (visitor→signup→upload→paid), refunds/fraud, Stripe success, auto‑pauses, top creative/segment, and SEO share.
Friday KPI 1‑pager: SLOs, revenue split (B2C/B2B), ARPU, margin, SEO net pages/CTR, funnel deltas, cost posture, incidents (if any), and next week’s ROI‑ranked experiments.
Non‑negotiables

Retargeting only (no prospecting).
FREEZE_LOCK remains on; keys rotate at T+48h; V1 archival on Day 7 with checksum/manifest.
Stay on the CAC ≤ $8 trajectory, protect margin ≥ 60%, and keep SEO as the primary growth engine.
