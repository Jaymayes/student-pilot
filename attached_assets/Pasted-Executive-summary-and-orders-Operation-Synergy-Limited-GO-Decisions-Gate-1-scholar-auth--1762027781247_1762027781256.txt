Executive summary and orders (Operation Synergy – Limited GO)

Decisions

Gate 1 (scholar_auth): Critical path. Republish required now. No production E2E or external sends until Gate 1 is GREEN.
B2C Limited GO: Authorized immediately after Gate 1 GREEN and after auto_com_center opt-out endpoints verify in production (DRY-RUN only; no live sends).
B2B GO: Not authorized. Provider flow remains in shadow mode for 24 hours with evidence bundle before decision.
Architecture: Proceed with Option C (hybrid path-based routing) after B2C Limited GO. Do not delay E2E for this. Target completion: T+4 hours post E2E.
Compliance gating: No outbound communication until unsubscribe/suppression endpoints are live, reachable, and verified end-to-end in production. DRY-RUN only until compliance passes.
Immediate actions and owners

Human Ops (NOW – 15 minutes)
Action: Republish scholar_auth.
Acceptance tests (all must pass):
Canary: curl -s https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/canary
JWKS: curl -s https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/jwks.json
Health: curl -s https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/healthz
Confirm in channel: “Gate 1 GREEN” with:
ISSUER_URL and JWKS_URL responding
/login, /register, /logout, /token/refresh reachable
JWT roles present (Student, Provider, Admin, SystemService)
2. Platform Lead (auto_com_center routing – start now, target T+30 minutes)

Triage steps:
Verify route order: app.use('/api', router) registered before any wildcard/catch-all.
Confirm no basePath stripping by proxy or middleware; check any rewrite rules and trailing-slash behavior.
Validate build artifact in deployment container matches latest commit (hash/time).
Check framework/router exports (default vs named) and ensure the server actually mounts the new router.
Confirm CORS and body-parser are active for new routes and not gated by a path prefix.
Acceptance tests (must pass for compliance sign-off):
POST /api/unsubscribe returns 200 with idempotent behavior.
GET /api/unsubscribe?email=… serves confirmation HTML.
GET /api/suppression-list accessible only to Admin/SystemService via RBAC; 401/403 otherwise.
Send path checks suppression before enqueue; idempotency via request_id.
Until these pass in production: DRY-RUN only; no live sends.
3. DRI: student_pilot (E2E lead – T+0 to T+120 after Gate 1 GREEN)

Execute the full B2C journey with ≥30 samples:
Auth (scholar_auth) → Profile CRUD (student_pilot) → Search (scholarship_api) → Recommendations (scholarship_sage) → Submit application → Status tracking.
Targets:
Per-hop P95 ≤ 120 ms; success rate ≥ 98%; zero CORS/auth errors.
Accessibility (Lighthouse) ≥ 90.
Deliverables:
HAR file, screenshots, standardized error payload checks, P50/P95/P99 per hop.
4. DRI: scholarship_sage (recommendations – parallel with E2E)

Capture ≥30 recommendation samples during E2E.
Deliver P50/P95/P99, success rate, sample request/response (PII-redacted).
Maintain Responsible AI controls (assistive guidance only; no plagiarism).
5. DRI: scholarship_api (performance plan – 72 hours)

Current: P95 ≈ 200 ms (above 120 ms SLO).
Plan:
24h: DB indexes and N+1 fixes; enable read caches for heavy endpoints (goal P95 ≤ 150 ms).
48h: Response slimming and compression; projection/ETag (goal P95 ≤ 130 ms).
72h: Redis/TTL for listings and recs; conditional requests (goal P95 ≤ 120 ms).
Verify after each phase with ≥30 samples; publish deltas.
6. DRI: provider_register (B2B – shadow mode, 24 hours)

Re-verify RBAC isolation with fresh scholar_auth keys after Gate 1.
Execute 30+ tenant isolation checks; verify 3% fee disclosure; standardized errors; security headers; P95 compliance.
Evidence bundle due T+24h for GO decision.
7. DRI: auto_page_maker (SEO engine – 24 hours)

Verify trigger on scholarship create/update from scholarship_api.
Confirm page generation with correct data population, schema.org metadata, canonical URLs, and brand guidelines.
Confirm auto-deploy and public accessibility. Provide 5 sample URLs with Lighthouse SEO ≥ 90.
8. DRI: scholar_auth (post-republish – T+5 to T+15)

Post Gate 1 GREEN evidence bundle:
Endpoint validations, JWKS, RBAC in JWT, CORS allowlist to student_pilot and provider_register, rate limiting, and 6/6 security headers.
Confirm P95 baseline across 30 samples.
GO/NO-GO status (current)

scholar_auth: NO-GO until republish; Gate 1 must be GREEN.
scholarship_api: Conditional GO for B2C; performance tuning plan accepted.
scholarship_sage: GO for B2C.
student_pilot: GO immediately after Gate 1 GREEN (executes E2E).
provider_register: NO-GO; shadow-only for 24 hours.
auto_page_maker: Pending 24h verification; not on B2C critical path; must complete for SEO engine.
auto_com_center: DRY-RUN ONLY; NO SEND until compliance endpoints verified.
Compliance and risk posture

Outbound messaging remains disabled until unsubscribe/suppression endpoints pass production tests.
Maintain HTTPS/TLS for all inter-service calls; centralized auth only via scholar_auth; standardized JSON errors.
Responsible AI: Continue bias mitigation, logging of high-risk prompts, transparent disclosures; no features that enable academic dishonesty.
KPIs we will log in today’s run

B2C funnel: auth success rate, profile completion rate, recommendation click-through, application submission rate.
Latency SLO: P95 ≤ 120 ms per hop; error rate ≤ 2%.
Auto_com_center: Compliance endpoints availability (SLA ≥ 99.9%), queue health (no dead letters), idempotent send path.
SEO engine: Number of pages generated, indexability, Lighthouse SEO ≥ 90.
Reporting cadence (Section 7 format)

Each DRI submits or reconfirms a Section 7 report to the war room repo path you already use (include evidence artifacts).
Deadlines:
Gate 1 GREEN evidence: immediately after republish (T+5–15 min).
B2C E2E report bundle: T+120 from Gate 1 GREEN.
auto_com_center compliance sign-off: T+60 from Gate 1 GREEN (required before any SEND).
provider_register shadow bundle: T+24h.
scholarship_api performance deltas: T+24h, T+48h, T+72h.
Lifecycle and revenue cessation guidance (executive framing)

Infrastructure (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center): Plan for 5–7 year rewrites or stepwise refactors. Track security standard evolution (e.g., beyond OAuth 2.0/OIDC), scaling thresholds, and key management rotations.
User-facing (student_pilot, provider_register): Expect 3–4 year major UX refresh cycles to maintain conversion and competitive parity.
Intelligence/automation (scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker): 2–3 year horizon; plan for continuous model/logic upgrades to avoid value erosion.
What I need from you now (single unblock)

Human Ops: Reply “Clicking Republish now” when you press the Republish button for scholar_auth, or reply “Cannot access deployment” to trigger an immediate escalation path.
We will hold the line on compliance and SLOs. Limited GO proceeds the moment Gate 1 turns GREEN and auto_com_center compliance endpoints validate in production (DRY-RUN).
