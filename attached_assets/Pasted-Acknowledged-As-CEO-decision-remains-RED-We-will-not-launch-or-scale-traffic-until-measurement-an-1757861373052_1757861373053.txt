Acknowledged. As CEO, decision remains RED. We will not launch or scale traffic until measurement and stability are restored.

Immediate executive directives

Freeze new features and marketing spend. Only P0 work on telemetry, schema integrity, and SLO recovery is authorized for the next 72 hours.
Establish a 24/7 incident war-room led by Engineering Ops. Status updates every 4 hours with a single source of truth doc.
Protect SEO assets: keep sitemap available but cap page growth; no new programmatic categories until SLOs stabilize.
Maintain compliance posture: no PII in logs; preserve all logs/metrics for RCA.
48-hour recovery plan (owners, deliverables, acceptance criteria)

DB schema integrity (Owner: DBA)
Task: Restore cohort_users and reconcile schema drift; validate migrations/checksums.
Deliverables: migration report and app logs showing no 42P01 for 24h; cohort_users row count > 0; last_write_timestamp < 24h.
Acceptance: Zero 42P01 errors; dependent queries succeed.
2. Analytics/BI availability (Owner: Frontend lead + Analytics)

Task: Null-safety guard on TtvDashboardTile; ensure API returns non-null metrics or explicit 0; add contract tests for medianTTV, MAU, conversion, ARPU.
Deliverables: dashboard renders without exceptions; payload sample with non-null fields recorded in logs.
Acceptance: MAU, conversion rate, and ARPU display numeric values; no null-pointer exceptions in the last 24h.
3. Revenue observability (Owner: Backend lead)

Task: Expose a read-only revenue summary endpoint or cached report for B2C/B2B MRR/ARR; no secrets; auth-protected.
Deliverables: last-7-day revenue snapshot with timestamp and report ID.
Acceptance: arr_b2c_usd, arr_b2b_usd, arr_total_usd are numeric and logged daily.
4. SLO recovery (Owner: SRE/Infra)

Task: Identify slow endpoints; add caching and N+1 query guards; enable APM and structured error tracking.
Deliverables: performance dashboard link with P50/P95/P99 and error rate panels; incident runbook.
Acceptance: Interim P95 ≤ 250ms and error rate ≤ 1.0% within 24h; target P95 ≤ 120ms and error rate ≤ 0.1% within 72h.
5. Guardrails verification (Owner: Security)

Task: Ensure Agent Bridge remains disabled; /.well-known/security.txt serves correct text; headers unchanged.
Acceptance: All security checks PASS; no autonomous actions enabled.
Move-to-Yellow criteria (must all be true)

No 42P01 (or equivalent schema) errors for 24h.
MAU, conversion, and ARR are non-null and reported daily.
P95 ≤ 250ms and error rate ≤ 1.0% for 24h (path to 120ms/0.1% documented).
Read-only revenue summary accessible to execs.
Updated SLO dashboard and on-call alerts live.
Post-incident requirements (within 72 hours)

Blameless RCA with direct and contributing causes, detection/gap analysis, and specific prevention actions (schema drift detection, migration gating, contract tests).
Instrumentation debt register with owners and due dates.
Copy-paste re-verification prompt (read-only, delta-focused)
Read-Only Delta Verification — ScholarshipAI Student Pilot
Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Strict read-only. Do not change data, configs, jobs, or integrations. Use only existing telemetry and stored reports.

Objective
Confirm resolution of the previously failing items (DB 42P01, analytics null pointers, revenue observability, SLOs). Provide PASS/WARN/FAIL with evidence and a go/no-go.

Checks and required evidence
A) DB schema integrity

Expectation: No 42P01; cohort_users visible to the app.
Evidence: latest app/migration logs with timestamps; row count and last_write_timestamp from existing diagnostics.
B) Analytics/BI

Expectation: TtvDashboardTile renders; MAU, conversion, ARPU non-null.
Evidence: dashboard render trace IDs; sample JSON payload with fields: mau_28d, conversion_rate_pct, arpu_usd.
C) Revenue observability

Expectation: Read-only B2C/B2B ARR visible from a stored report.
Evidence: report name/ID, values with timestamps.
D) SLOs (last 24h)

Expectation: P95 ≤ 250ms, error rate ≤ 1.0% (target path to 120ms/0.1% documented).
Evidence: performance dashboard/log IDs plus P50/P95/P99 snapshot.
E) Security/compliance parity

Expectation: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options unchanged; /.well-known/security.txt returns 200 text/plain.
Evidence: header capture and status code.
F) SEO sanity

Expectation: Valid sitemap; URL count reported; no critical XML errors.
Evidence: sitemap fetch logs; validator output reference.
G) Guardrails

Expectation: Agent Bridge disabled/dry-run.
Evidence: config/status report ID.
KPIs to report (mark UNKNOWN if unavailable; any UNKNOWN on MAU, conversion, or ARR = FAIL)

MAU (28d, 90d), conversion rate, ARPU, ARR (B2C/B2B/Total), P95 latency, error rate, indexed pages.
Output format

Executive summary (5–8 bullets) with decision.
KPI table: Current, Target, Variance%, Status.
Issue results A–G with PASS/WARN/FAIL and evidence links/IDs.
Endpoint health table: /health, /sitemap.xml, /.well-known/security.txt, and analytics endpoints.
JSON: { "timestamp": "...", "instance": "...", "issues": {...}, "kpis": {...}, "decision": {"status": "Green|Yellow|Red", "justification": "...", "blockers": [{"owner": "", "eta_days": 0}]} }
Authority note

This is a verification prompt only; no system changes are to be executed as part of this audit. Engineering owns remediation execution under the war-room plan above.
