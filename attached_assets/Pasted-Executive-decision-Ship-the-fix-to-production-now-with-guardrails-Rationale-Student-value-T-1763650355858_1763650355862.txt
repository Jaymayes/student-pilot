Executive decision: Ship the fix to production now with guardrails.

Rationale

Student value: This resolves a core discovery failure that blocks students from seeing scholarships, directly impacting conversion to engagement and revenue.
SLOs: Your latest measurements show P95 latency well under the 120ms target for both list and detail endpoints, so we’re safe on performance.
Risk: The OAuth issue (DEFECT-004) is separate and should not block publishing the scholarships fix. We will mitigate auth risk with a short-term product adjustment (see below).
Directive to the team
Deploy window: Immediate (today). Ownership: Engineering + Release Manager. Duration: <60 minutes.

Release plan

Pre-deploy checks (5–10 min)
Confirm the commit hash and that routes are calling the storage layer (explicit column selection; no circular refs).
Smoke-test in dev:
GET /api/scholarships returns 81 active items.
GET /api/scholarships/{valid_id} returns full JSON.
404 behavior for invalid IDs is correct.
Verify environment variables and DB credentials for production snapshot. No pending migrations for these endpoints.
2. Publish new Replit deployment snapshot (10 min)

Use the existing production deployment configuration; publish a new snapshot so the public URL updates.
Ensure the production start command matches the stable (non-watch) server start and uses the storage-layer queries you validated.
Document the deployment version tag (e.g., web-<date>-scholarships-fix) in the release notes.
3. Post-deploy verification (10–15 min)

At the public URL, validate:
GET /api/scholarships returns count ≈81.
GET /api/scholarships/{valid_id} returns complete JSON.
Page-level smoke tests for the scholarships list and details load without serialization errors.
Check logs for error spikes for 15 minutes. Confirm P95 latency remains ≤120ms.
4. Monitoring and rollback

Create a 2-hour heightened monitoring window (error rates, latency, 5xxs).
Rollback plan: revert to prior snapshot if API error rate >1% for 5 consecutive minutes, or P95 latency >400ms for 10 minutes.
Product adjustments to protect student experience

Short-term: Allow browsing scholarships without requiring login; defer login to “Save” or “Apply” actions. Gate via a feature flag so we can revert once auth is stable.
Update the CTA flow and copy to make it clear: “Browse scholarships instantly — sign in when you’re ready to save or apply.”
Priority follow-ups (this week)

Resolve DEFECT-004 (Auth discovery/OAuth callback)
Owner: Auth squad. SLA: 48 hours to root cause and patch.
Add automated E2E covering the full “Start Your Journey → browse → save → login → return” path.
2. SEO and growth hygiene (low CAC priority)

After deployment, purge caches and resubmit sitemap in Search Console.
Trigger Auto Page Maker to regenerate scholarship index pages so Google re-crawls healthy pages and sheds the prior error state.
Add an annotation in Analytics at deployment time for attribution.
3. Instrumentation and KPIs

Instrument events:
scholarship_list_viewed
scholarship_detail_viewed
time_to_first_result
attempted_login, login_error, login_success
save_scholarship_clicked, apply_clicked
Targets to report tomorrow:
Error rate on scholarship endpoints (goal: <0.1%)
P95 latency (goal: ≤120ms)
% of sessions reaching scholarship list (goal: +30% vs. pre-fix)
Time to first result (goal: <2.0s page-level, <150ms API)
Conversion to save/apply click from list (baseline + target)
4. Process hardening

Add a “Replit deployment snapshot” runbook to prevent dev/prod drift.
Add a CI gate that runs serialization tests to catch circular references on any API response shape change.
Document the storage-layer pattern (explicit projections) as a mandatory API guideline.
Confirmation needed

Proceed with the deployment plan above and report back with:
Deployment tag + commit hash
Post-deploy verification checklist results
2-hour monitoring summary against the KPIs
If you want step-by-step Replit UI guidance for publishing the new snapshot, I will have the Release Manager follow our runbook and share screenshots; otherwise, go ahead and execute now and post the verification results.
