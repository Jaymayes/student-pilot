Excellent work. Step 5 is complete and the reliability foundation now matches our growth ambition. With 4x faster average response (119ms → 26ms), full circuit breaker coverage, and financial integrity safeguards, we’re positioned to scale safely.

Directive: Proceed to Task perf-6 (Load & Stress Testing) with the following CEO-level objectives, scope, success criteria, and timeline. Do not expand paid acquisition or major provider onboarding until perf-6 is signed off.

Objectives (tied to $10M ARR plan)

Validate capacity for 12-month growth horizon with 3x headroom over our expected peak traffic (supports seasonal spikes, marketing campaigns, and provider launches).
Protect conversion and revenue operations under load: zero payment duplication, zero charge-on-failure, and graceful degradation without blocking critical user flows.
Confirm SLO attainment at scale (target internal buffer) to preserve user experience that drives organic growth (SEO engine + low CAC).
Test Scope and Scenarios

Baseline capacity test
Goal: Establish sustainable throughput per service tier and end-to-end.
Targets:
Endpoints: P95 ≤ 100ms (internal target), P99 ≤ 250ms; Error rate ≤ 0.1% at target QPS.
Cache hit ratio ≥ 85% for hot paths; DB slow queries per minute ≤ 5; 0 payment idempotency breaches.
2. Stress-to-break test

Goal: Determine failure thresholds and bottlenecks; verify circuit breakers trip cleanly; no financial leakage.
Observe: Tail latencies, queue depths, lock contention, memory pressure events, breaker open/half-open behavior.
3. Spike test

Goal: Validate autoscaling and thundering-herd resilience (backoff + jitter).
Targets: Recovery to normal P95 within 2 minutes; no cascading failures.
4. Soak test (72 hours)

Goal: Surface memory leaks, GC pathologies, connection pool churn, cache eviction pathologies.
Targets: Stable memory/CPU; no error accumulation; breaker stability; <1% drift in P95 over run.
5. Dependency degradation drills

Simulate OpenAI, Stripe, Storage partial/total outages.
Targets: Graceful fallbacks engaged; critical flows preserved; zero charge-on-failure; clear user messaging.
6. SEO traffic replay and provider workflows

Replay anonymized production-like traffic for Auto Page Maker pages; simulate search-driven spikes.
High-volume provider actions: listing sync, search, and funding verification; ensure 3% fee pipeline stability.
KPIs to collect and dashboard

Core SLOs: availability (99.9%+), P95/P99 latency per endpoint, error budget burn per service.
Throughput & capacity: QPS per service, autoscaling latency, queue lengths, breaker trip/half-open rates.
Resource health: CPU, memory, GC pauses, DB connections, lock wait times, slow query counts.
Business integrity: payment success rate, duplicate charge rate (target 0), idempotency token reuse, refund queue size.
Experience drivers: cache hit ratio, cold start incidence, search page generation latency, agent task completion time.
Cost guardrails: cost/QPS by service; cloud spend during tests vs. budget.
Success Criteria and Go/No-Go Gates

Gate 1 (Baseline): Hit target QPS with P95 ≤ 100ms and error rate ≤ 0.1%. If not, pause and remediate hotspots.
Gate 2 (Stress/Spike): Clean breaker behavior; system self-recovers to baseline within 2 minutes post-spike; no financial integrity breaches.
Gate 3 (Soak): No material memory leaks; tail latencies stable; no alert fatigue; zero payment anomalies.
Final Sign-off: All gates met; runbooks updated; dashboards and alerts reflect learned thresholds; cost per unit traffic acceptable.
SLO Policy Update

External SLO remains 99.9% uptime and P95 ≤ 120ms.
Internal targets for perf-6:
P95 ≤ 100ms, P99 ≤ 250ms at target QPS.
Monthly error budget: ≤ 43.8 minutes downtime equivalent; alert on 25%, 50%, 75% burn.
Revisit tightening SLOs post perf-6 if margins remain strong.
Execution Plan and Roles

Week 1: Test plan finalization, environment parity checks, data anonymization, traffic replay setup. Owners: Reliability Eng + Data Platform.
Week 2: Baseline + stress + spike runs; immediate remediation cycle on bottlenecks. Owner: Reliability Eng; Support: DB Eng, App Teams.
Week 3: 72-hour soak; dependency drills; finalize dashboards/alerts/runbooks. Owner: SRE; Support: Payments, Integrations.
Deliverables:
Test plan and scripts (k6/Locust/Gatling), production-like datasets, chaos experiments, and rollback/runbooks.
Executive Summary Report: capacity headroom, bottlenecks fixed, costs, and readiness decision.
Controls and Risk Management

Data protection: Anonymized or synthetic datasets; no PII in test logs; FERPA/COPPA compliance maintained.
Cost cap: Pre-approved cloud spend ceiling; off-peak scheduling; teardown automation.
Marketing/Provider throttle: Hold large-scale campaigns and major provider activations until Final Sign-off.
Incident drill: One live game day post sign-off to validate playbooks without revenue impact.
Dependencies and Tooling

Leverage existing observability (correlation IDs, circuit breaker metrics) to tag test traffic vs. production.
Rate-limit coordination with third parties (OpenAI, Stripe) using sandbox endpoints or request shaping to avoid abuse flags.
Feature flags to safely enable/disable fallbacks and caching strategies during tests.
Decision Request

Approve this perf-6 plan, budget envelope for load testing infrastructure, and a 3-week execution window.
Authorize a post–perf-6 go-to-market ramp if all gates pass: scale SEO publishing by 2x, activate provider onboarding wave, and re-enable growth experiments in B2C funnel.
Once I have approval, I’ll instruct the teams to execute on this plan and schedule the Final Sign-off review.
