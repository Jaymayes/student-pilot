CEO Directive: Final Integration, Evidence, and Go/No-Go Gates (Authoritative)

Time: ~18:10 UTC
From: CEO, Scholar AI Advisor
To: All DRIs (Apps 1–8) + Finance/Platform Ops
Prime Directive: Guard the gate. Zero compromises on issuer correctness, security, performance, or deliverability. ARR goals stand; execute with rigor.

Top Decisions (Immediate)

Stripe Gate (provider_register) — Activate graceful fallback now
Decision: Option A approved. Enable ENABLE_WAITLIST_MODE=true in Replit Secrets immediately.
Rationale: Protect provider UX and brand; avoid failed checkouts while Stripe evidence is missing. Capture demand; defer payment.
Owner: provider_register DRI + Finance/Platform Ops
Deadline: 18:20 UTC for flag enable; 18:50 UTC for evidence that flag is live (logs + request_id samples).
Evidence required to close fallback activation:
Screenshot or config diff proving ENABLE_WAITLIST_MODE=true (redacted)
10 request_id samples showing waitlistMode=true rendered to provider UI
200 OK health on relevant endpoints; error rate ≤0.1%
2. Stripe Verification Evidence Package (Hard Gate) — Escalate

Decision: Escalate with Stripe Priority Support now; CFO authorized up to $500 for priority support.
Owner: Finance/Platform Ops
Deadline: 21:00 UTC evidence package or revised ETA with Stripe case ID.
Evidence required to PASS gate:
Masked screenshot: production live key configured
Webhook registration proof (endpoint, secret, version)
Signed event received and 200 OK response with request_id lineage
Optional: $0.50 live charge proof with redactions
3. Deliverability Guardrails (auto_com_center) — Execute full verification now

Decision: Authorized. Run the complete DKIM/SPF/DMARC + seed inbox test suite immediately. No broadcasts until GREEN.
Owner: auto_com_center DRI (Agent3 coordination + team execution)
Deadline: Start now; GREEN/RED certification and report by 22:00 UTC.
Acceptance criteria (Email):
DKIM: pass; SPF: pass; DMARC: policy p=quarantine or p=reject with alignment; evidence via dig outputs
Seed inbox placement ≥90% across Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo; zero spam-folder for transactional templates
Bounce <1%, complaint <0.1%; no blocklist hits
Acceptance criteria (SMS, if applicable):
STOP/HELP logged and honored in ≤5s; rate limits enforced; opt-in evidence captured
If SMS not fully configured: keep SMS channel OFF; email-only until GREEN.
4. Replit P1 + Cloudflare (scholar_auth) — Deliver infra proof

Decision: Deliver P1 ticket + Cloudflare provisioning proof for auth.scholaraiadvisor.com.
Owner: Platform Ops + scholar_auth DRI

Evidence required:
Replit P1 ticket ID
Cloudflare DNS screenshot/proof: auth CNAME/AAAA/ALIAS; SSL/TLS Full (strict)
