CEO Decision Memo — Scholar AI Advisor
Date: 2025-11-08 ~03:30 UTC

Executive Summary

Go/No-Go posture remains unchanged. Quality over speed is non-negotiable.
Proceed with scholar_auth infrastructure improvements immediately under existing budget.
18:00 UTC Stripe verification is a hard gate for B2B. Escalation protocol stands.
20:00 UTC soak test is the automatic decision point for Nov 9 vs Nov 10 gate.
ARR timeline unchanged: B2C earliest Nov 10 00:00 UTC; B2B earliest Nov 9 01:30–03:00 UTC if Stripe confirmed.
Authorizations and Directives

scholar_auth (APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Authorized: Proceed now with warmup/readiness fix and infra headroom.
Deadlines (unchanged):
08:00 UTC: Monitoring fix validation snapshot.
10:30 UTC HARD: Warmup/readiness complete with evidence (commit hash, diffs, logs).
12:30–13:30 UTC: Load Test #1.
14:00 UTC: Results package (P50/P95, error_rate).
16:00 UTC HARD: Infra headroom complete (DB tier, pooling, replicas/HPA, CDN, JWKS caching).
20:00 UTC: Soak Test #2; auto-slip if criteria breached.
22:00 UTC: Staging rehearsal with request_id traces.
23:30 UTC: Evidence pre-check complete.
Gate criteria (non-negotiable): Each endpoint P95 ≤120ms and error_rate ≤0.1% at both 00:10 and 00:15 UTC snapshots.
Security: Enforce OAuth2/OIDC with PKCE; validate token revocation and JWKS rotation. Keep-warm pings excluded from production error_rate.
2. provider_register (APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Status accepted: Technically green; B2B blocked pending Stripe.
18:00 UTC HARD DEADLINE: Production Stripe (live key, webhook registration, 200 OK test event).
Escalation: If at risk by 16:00 UTC, immediate escalation to CFO + Stripe support. No exceptions.
If Stripe misses 18:00 UTC: B2B remains blocked regardless of auth status; re-plan for next green window after auth pass.
3. auto_com_center (APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Coordination authority confirmed. Maintain gate enforcement and checkpoint tracking.
Prepare “Gate Day T-0” broadcast for Nov 9 00:00 UTC; hold AUTH GREEN TAG messaging pending CEO order.
At 20:00 UTC, if soak criteria fail, broadcast auto-slip to Nov 10 00:00–00:15 UTC and refresh all dependent timelines.
4. scholarship_api (APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Ready/Blocked posture accepted. No changes required.
On gate night, monitor 401/5xx tightly; capture request_id lineage with student_pilot, provider_register, and sage.
5. scholarship_sage (APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Ready/Blocked. No logic changes. Execute T+30 after AUTH GREEN TAG.
Evidence must show client_credentials grants, read-only scope enforcement, and lineage.
6. student_pilot (APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Ready/Blocked. Execute T+30 after AUTH GREEN TAG.
Evidence: Full E2E journey (PKCE S256 flow, profile CRUD, sage interaction), desktop + mobile responsiveness, request_id lineage, latency and error metrics.
7. auto_page_maker (APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Unaffected; continue 06:00 UTC daily KPI rollups.
Treat as primary low-CAC growth engine. Keep IndexNow ≥95% and CWV p75 GREEN.
8. scholarship_agent (APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)

Observe-only through Nov 12. No matching logic changes.
Continue fairness rollups at 12:00 UTC and summaries at 12:15 UTC.
Financials and ARR

Budget: Up to $1,500 for 7 days for auth infra work remains authorized. If Stripe verification requires paid priority support, pre-authorize up to $500 emergency spend with CFO confirmation before 16:00 UTC.
ARR timeline:
B2C (student_pilot): Earliest Nov 10 00:00 UTC.
B2B (provider_register): Earliest Nov 9 01:30–03:00 UTC contingent on Stripe by 18:00 UTC today and auth pass.
Organic (auto_page_maker): Unchanged; continue compounding SEO.
Risk, Compliance, and Ethics

Regulatory: Maintain FERPA/COPPA compliance; no PII in logs. 7-day log retention minimum.
Responsible AI: scholarship_agent remains observe-only; fairness monitoring continues. No auto-apply without explicit student consent and audit trail.
Security posture: Confirm TLS reuse at ingress, JWKS TTL ~300s with background refresh, do not cache token/authorization endpoints, and ensure immediate token revocation works as evidenced by logs.
Evidence Discipline (Mandatory Format)

Every report must begin with:
Application Name
APP_BASE_URL
Include: commit hashes, diffs, logs, screenshots (redacted), P50/P95, error_rate, and full request_id lineage across services.
Deadlines: 08:00, 10:30, 14:00, 16:00, 18:00, 20:00, 22:00, 23:30 UTC as scheduled.
RAG Status Roll-up

scholar_auth: Amber (in-flight remediation; hard gates today).
provider_register: Amber (Stripe production verification outstanding).
scholarship_api: Green.
scholarship_sage: Green (Ready/Blocked).
student_pilot: Green (Ready/Blocked).
scholarship_agent: Green (Observe-only).
auto_page_maker: Green (Unaffected).
auto_com_center: Green (Coordination active).
CEO Decision

Proceed now with the auth infrastructure improvements and warmup/readiness fix. All checkpoints and evidence requirements stand as documented. Auto-slip at 20:00 UTC if soak test breaches criteria. Stripe 18:00 UTC remains a hard deadline for B2B. Hold AUTH GREEN TAG messaging until explicit CEO authorization during the gate window.
Next CEO touchpoints

08:05 UTC: Review monitoring fix validation snapshot.
10:35 UTC: Review warmup/readiness evidence. If incomplete, initiate Course Correction Plan.
14:05 UTC: Review Load Test #1 results and mitigation plan if margins are thin.
18:05 UTC: Stripe Go/Block decision.
20:05 UTC: Soak Test outcome; confirm proceed vs auto-slip.
23:35 UTC: Evidence pre-check acceptance for all apps.
Deliver. Maintain discipline. Guard the gate.
