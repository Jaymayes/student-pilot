Below is your unified, app-scoped execution prompt for Agent3 v2.2. It covers all eight apps but strictly instructs the agent to only execute the section for the app they are assigned to. It also includes time-to-revenue estimates and a readiness report template that requires the app to name itself and include its base APP_BASE_URL.

Copy/paste this entire prompt into Agent3. Do not modify the app sections or acceptance criteria formatting, so all teams stay aligned.

Integration dependencies and handoffs

Critical path to first B2C revenue:
scholar_auth → student_pilot
If scholar_auth is not yet production-ready: 6–8h + 2–4h = 8–12h to first B2C revenue
If scholar_auth is already production-ready: 2–4h to first B2C revenue
Critical path to first B2B revenue:
scholar_auth → provider_register
6–8h + 5–7h = 11–15h to first B2B revenue (or 5–7h if auth is already ready)
Supporting systems should not block revenue, but must not break CORS or security for siblings:
scholarship_api must be reachable from student_pilot and auto_page_maker
auto_com_center must accept messages from student_pilot and scholarship_agent
scholarship_sage read-only dashboards must not write to prod data
Readiness report template (each app must include exact fields)

Title: <ASSIGNED_APP> v2.2 Production Readiness Report
APP_NAME: <ASSIGNED_APP>
APP_BASE_URL: <APP_BASE_URL> [Required: the app must name itself and include base URL]
VERSION: v2.2
Phase 0 status:
Canary endpoints: PASS/FAIL with sample JSON
Security headers: 6/6 PASS/FAIL with header dump
CORS allowlist: list of 8 origins (must match)
p95_ms (30 requests): <number>; 0% 5xx: YES/NO
Phase 1 status:
Feature checklist from your app section with PASS/FAIL per item
Integration tests executed:
List cross-app calls tested (e.g., JWT verify with scholar_auth, reads from scholarship_api, sends via auto_com_center)
Risks and mitigations:
Security, privacy (FERPA/COPPA), Responsible AI notes
Artifacts:
e2e/reports/<ASSIGNED_APP>/readiness_report_<ASSIGNED_APP>_v2.2_unified.md
e2e/reports/<ASSIGNED_APP>/fix_plan_<ASSIGNED_APP>_v2.2.yaml
Revenue start ETAs (for planning; choose the scenario that matches reality)

If scholar_auth not yet production-ready:
First B2C revenue via student_pilot: 8–12 hours total
First B2B revenue via provider_register: 11–15 hours total
If scholar_auth already production-ready:
First B2C revenue via student_pilot: 2–4 hours
First B2B revenue via provider_register: 5–7 hours
Responsible AI, security, and compliance guardrails (all apps)

Bias mitigation: do not auto-rank scholarships in a way that restricts access; expose filters transparently
Transparency: no black-box decisions blocking user access; provide explanations where applicable
Privacy: minimum necessary PII; no storing sensitive data unless absolutely required
Regulatory: FERPA/COPPA-aligned handling of student data; age gating if needed
Security: never log secrets or full tokens; rotate keys; enforce rate limiting and input validation
How to ask for help or surface blockers

If you detect a hard dependency that is not live (e.g., scholar_auth JWKS unreachable), complete Phase 0, document the blocker in your readiness report, and request an assembly decision in your console summary.
Do not modify or stub other apps’ routes. Use test doubles only where explicitly allowed by your app section.
Completion format (must reply on finish)

When done, print a one-screen console summary including:
APP_NAME, APP_BASE_URL, VERSION
Phase 0 PASS/FAIL, Phase 1 PASS/FAIL
Readiness Score (1–5)
p95_ms and error rate
Direct revenue impact (Yes/No; how)

End of AGENT3 v2.2 APP-SCOPED EXECUTION PROMPT
CEO Notes and assignments

Begin by assigning Agent3 to scholar_auth unless you have already verified it is production-ready. This unlocks both B2C and B2B revenue paths.
Immediately after scholar_auth completes, assign student_pilot to reach first B2C revenue. Target: 8–12h from zero, or 2–4h if auth is already ready.
Third assignment: provider_register to activate B2B revenue. Target: 11–15h from zero, or 5–7h if auth is already ready.
All other apps can proceed in parallel if you have team bandwidth, but they must not block the critical path.
Clarification about “stop generating revenue”

Interpreting your request as “start generating revenue.” If you literally meant “stop generating revenue,” say so and I will provide a controlled shutdown plan.
