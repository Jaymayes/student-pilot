Executive decision: Republish now; do not accept localhost as Gate 1 compliance

Rationale

Brand trust, security, and interop depend on production endpoints resolving at the published URLs. Localhost evidence is insufficient to certify FOC or to unblock Limited GO.
Gate 1 (scholar_auth) and compliance endpoints (auto_com_center) are foundational. Proceeding without public URL verification risks cascading failures in student_pilot, provider_register, and all M2M flows, and jeopardizes our SLOs and CAC targets.
Authorizations and directives

Immediate actions (T+0 to T+15 minutes)
Human Ops:
Execute Manual Republish for:
scholar_auth: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
auto_com_center: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Reply in this thread: “Clicking Republish now” (for audit trail). If you cannot access deployment, reply: “Cannot access deployment” for immediate escalation.
DRIs on standby:
Auth DRI: Prepare post-republish acceptance tests (see checklist below).
Com Center DRI: Prepare post-republish compliance endpoint tests.
2. Gate 1 acceptance checklist (must pass at public URLs)
scholar_auth

Canary: GET /canary returns status: ok, version, p95_ms
JWKS: GET /.well-known/jwks.json live and key KID matches deployed signer
Health: GET /healthz returns healthy true
Auth endpoints reachable: /login, /register, /logout, /token/refresh
RBAC: JWT roles Student, Provider, Admin, SystemService appear in claims; validate against JWKS
CORS: Only student_pilot and provider_register origins allowed
Rate limiting: Active and observed on burst
Performance (warm): P95 ≤ 200ms on canary and token refresh; target ≤ 120ms after 72-hour tuning
Security headers: 6/6 present
auto_com_center

Compliance endpoints live and routable:
POST /api/unsubscribe → 200 with confirmation payload
GET /api/unsubscribe (HTML) → Confirmation page
GET /api/suppression-list → Returns schema with count
Events disabled for real sends (DRY-RUN mode): ensure sandbox routing or suppression flag is ON
CORS + security headers: present and correct
Queue health: No dead-letter growth during tests
3. Limited GO authorization (B2C) — conditional

Authorized: Yes, in DRY-RUN mode, only after Gate 1 turns GREEN at public URLs for scholar_auth and auto_com_center.
Scope:
student_pilot full E2E with production endpoints
scholarship_api, scholarship_sage integrations
auto_com_center: deliverability simulated; no outbound to real users (sandboxed/suppressed)
Exit criteria to convert from DRY-RUN to LIVE:
Zero 5xx across auth and E2E flows over ≥30 end-to-end samples
JWT validation success rate = 100%
P95 per hop ≤ 120ms targets on stabilized runs (auth can be ≤ 200ms during warm, trend to 120ms within 72h)
CORS/auth errors = 0
Accessibility (student_pilot): Lighthouse Accessibility ≥ 90
4. E2E execution timeline (post Gate 1 GREEN)

T+0: Auth DRI posts GREEN with evidence bundle
T+15 to T+120: E2E run (student_pilot lead)
Flows: login → profile CRUD → scholarship search (scholarship_api) → recommendations (scholarship_sage) → application submit → status tracking
Evidence: HAR files, screenshots, standardized error payload checks, P50/P95/P99 per hop, ≥30 samples
T+120: Evidence bundles posted by each DRI; war room summary compiled for CEO review
5. Fallbacks and escalation (if Replit proxy path rewrite persists)

Attempt 1: Rebuild with explicit root path config and disable path rewriting; verify /.well-known/ passthrough
Attempt 2: Switch to dedicated custom domains with TLS and a thin proxy (Cloudflare/NGINX) that preserves paths; cache JWKS with short TTL (≤ 5 min)
Rollback: Revert to last known good build if public endpoints fail after 10 minutes; keep sandbox up for debugging
SLA: If Gate 1 cannot be GREEN within 60 minutes, escalate to Platform Lead and move B2C validation to next window
6. Reporting requirements (Section 7)

Every DRI must submit or update the standardized Section 7 report by T+24 hours, including Lifecycle and Revenue Cessation Analysis and evidence links. No exceptions. These reports are prerequisites for FOC sign-off.
7. Lifecycle guidance (executive expectations)

Infrastructure (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center): Plan for 5–7 year overhaul cycles; track OAuth/OIDC evolution and crypto agility (key rotation, post-quantum roadmap).
User-facing (student_pilot, provider_register): Expect 3–4 year major UI/UX refresh cadence; keep WCAG and design system current.
Intelligence/automation (scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker): Assume 2–3 year replacement cycles driven by AI advances; modularize models/pipelines to swap with minimal downtime.
Business justification

Production verification avoids false positives that inflate our funnel metrics and CAC models.
Maintaining reliability at the auth and comm layers directly impacts conversion, retention, and provider trust—key levers for our $10M ARR plan.
DRY-RUN protects brand and compliance while validating the end-to-end path required for organic SEO growth via Auto Page Maker.
Action required now

Human Ops: Execute republish and reply “Clicking Republish now” within 15 minutes or report “Cannot access deployment.”
Auth DRI and Com Center DRI: Prepare to run the public URL checklists immediately upon republish and post evidence bundles.
Once Gate 1 is GREEN, I authorize the B2C Limited GO (DRY-RUN) and expect the full evidence bundle within T+120.
