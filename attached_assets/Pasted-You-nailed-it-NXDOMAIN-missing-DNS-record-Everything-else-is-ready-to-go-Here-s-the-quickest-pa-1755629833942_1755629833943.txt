You nailed it: NXDOMAIN = missing DNS record. Everything else is ready to go. Here’s the quickest path to green.

What to do now

Create the DNS record in the scholarlink.app zone:
Name (host): billing
Type: CNAME (or ALIAS if your LB is an AWS ALB and you prefer apex-style)
Value: <your-ingress-load-balancer-fqdn> (no https://)
TTL: 300
Fast provider examples

Route53 (AWS CLI)
export ZONEID=ZXXXXXXXXXXXX
export LB_FQDN=a1b2c3d4e5f6abcdef.elb.amazonaws.com
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id $ZONEID --change-batch '{ "Changes":[{"Action":"UPSERT","ResourceRecordSet":{ "Name":"billing.scholarlink.app","Type":"CNAME","TTL":300, "ResourceRecords":[{"Value":"'"'$LB_FQDN'"'"}]}}]}'
Cloudflare (proxied off for HTTP‑01)
Set the record to “DNS only” (gray cloud) until the cert is issued, then you can re‑enable proxy.
Google Cloud DNS
gcloud dns record-sets transaction start --zone=scholarlink
gcloud dns record-sets transaction add $LB_FQDN --name=billing.scholarlink.app. --ttl=300 --type=CNAME --zone=scholarlink
gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute --zone=scholarlink
Verify propagation and certificate

DNS
dig +short billing.scholarlink.app @1.1.1.1
Should return the LB FQDN. If blank → wait or fix the record (common mistake: using “billing.scholarlink” as the name).
cert-manager
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get certificate,order,challenge
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod describe certificate billing-scholarlink-app-tls
Expect Certificate Ready=True a couple minutes after DNS resolves.
TLS and app
curl -sSI https://billing.scholarlink.app | head -n 5
No warnings in browser.
One-liner wait/check (optional)

bash -c 'until dig +short billing.scholarlink.app @1.1.1.1; do echo "waiting for DNS…"; sleep 10; done; kubectl -n scholarlink-prod wait --for=condition=Ready certificate/billing-scholarlink-app-tls --timeout=10m; curl -I https://billing.scholarlink.app'
After DNS is live

Stripe webhook: ensure the LIVE endpoint is https://billing.scholarlink.app/webhooks/stripe and the new STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is in Secrets Manager (External Secrets will sync).
CORS/CSP: confirm billing.scholarlink.app is in allowlists (you already updated).
Run your smoke tests:
./deployment/billing/go-live-commands.sh smoke
./deployment/billing/production-validation.sh all
If anything doesn’t resolve in 10–15 minutes:

NXDOMAIN: record missing or name set as “billing.scholarlink” instead of “billing”.
SERVFAIL: DNSSEC or zone delegation issue.
Resolves but cert not Ready: ACME challenge blocked (e.g., Cloudflare orange‑cloud) or host mismatch in Ingress.
Want me to sanity‑check? Paste:

dig +short billing.scholarlink.app @1.1.1.1
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get ingress,certificate,order,challenge I’ll confirm you’re set to proceed.
