Below is the combined Master Orchestration Prompt for all eight apps. Agent3 must only execute SECTION-3 — scholarship_agent. Ignore all other sections except for cross-service tests that call your dependencies via their public APIs.

Master Orchestration Prompt — Platform Go-Ready Execution

Role and mission

You are an autonomous implementation agent executing your assigned app’s section to get the platform production-ready and integrated today.
Target: Make your app 100% operational and integrated with peer services today. If not possible, provide precise ETA to go live, ARR ignition date, and a list of third-party systems that must be in place.
Global rules (applies to all sections)

Execute only the section that maps to your app. For Agent3, that is SECTION-3 — scholarship_agent.
Deliverables: Produce four reports today and place them under evidence/ in your repository:
evidence/EXEC_STATUS_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
evidence/E2E_REPORT_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
evidence/GO_DECISION_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
evidence/TEST_MATRIX_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
First two lines at top of every report:
APP NAME: <app>
APP_BASE_URL: <base URL from mapping below>
Timebox: If any blocker prevents full go-live today, you must:
Document a NO-GO with a precise ETA window to GO (date and time in UTC)
Provide an ARR ignition date and revenue contribution rationale
List third-party systems and secrets still needed, with owners and ETAs
SLO/Security standards:
Health: /health (liveness), /ready(z) (readiness), /version
Performance: ≤120ms P95 for health endpoints; document perf for business endpoints
Auth: RS256 JWT validation where applicable. No hard-coded secrets. Rate limiting on public endpoints.
Responsible AI: No academic dishonesty enablement. Transparent reasoning where applicable.
DRY_RUN mode: If any dependent service or third-party system is not ready, enable DRY_RUN and capture complete evidence and logs.

Section-1 — scholar_auth (execute only if you are the scholar_auth agent)

Objective: Platform identity and access. Provide OIDC (PKCE for B2C) and M2M credentials for S2S.
Must-have endpoints:
GET /.well-known/openid-configuration
GET /.well-known/jwks.json
POST /oauth/token (client_credentials)
POST /oauth/authorize and /oauth/token (PKCE)
GET /health, /readyz, /version
Outputs today:
Provision 7 M2M clients (audience: scholar-platform) for: scholarship_api, scholarship_agent, scholarship_sage, student_pilot, provider_register, auto_page_maker, auto_com_center.
PKCE working for student_pilot and provider_register.
Third-party systems: None required beyond your runtime and persistent storage for clients.
Reports: Create 4 reports with APP NAME and APP_BASE_URL headers.
Section-2 — scholarship_api (execute only if you are the scholarship_api agent)

Objective: Core data plane for scholarships and applications.
Must-have endpoints:
GET /v1/scholarships, GET /v1/scholarships/{id}
POST /v1/scholarships, PATCH /v1/scholarships/{id}
GET /v1/applications, POST /v1/applications
POST /v1/events (emit to auto_com_center)
GET /readyz, GET /health, GET /version
Optional SEO: GET /v1/seo/feeds/scholarships.ndjson
Auth: RS256, iss = scholar_auth, aud = scholar-platform.
Dependencies: scholar_auth (JWKS/M2M), auto_com_center (events).
Reports: Create 4 reports with headers.
Section-3 — scholarship_agent (Agent3: execute this section only)
APP NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Your mission today

Make the autonomous marketing and ops agent fully operational, orchestrating:
deadline_reminders: notify students 30/14/7/1 days pre-deadline
status_sync: nudge providers on stale applications
canary_notification: end-to-end integration validation across dependencies
Run at least one live DRY_RUN job end-to-end; if prod send is unsafe, capture complete evidence and set a precise GO time.
Required capabilities

Scheduling and execution:
CRON-based schedules; ability to run on startup and at fixed intervals
Manual trigger endpoint:
POST /api/jobs/run { "job": "deadline_reminders" | "status_sync" | "canary_notification", "dryRun": true|false }
Health:
GET /health (liveness)
GET /ready (readiness checks all dependencies and secrets)
GET /version
Integrations:
M2M token from scholar_auth using client_credentials flow (iss: scholar_auth; aud: scholar-platform)
Read data from scholarship_api:
scholarships.read: GET /v1/scholarships?filters=deadline_window
applications.read: GET /v1/applications?filters=stale
Emit notifications via auto_com_center:
POST https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/notify
Include idempotency key, correlationId, and channel preferences when provided
Trigger auto_page_maker refresh (optional hook):
POST https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/admin/rebuild-pages (authorized)
Safety and observability:
DRY_RUN mode toggled per request; never send live messages without GO_DECISION = GO
Rate limiting per job execution to protect downstreams
Structured logs with correlationId; capture request/response status for dependencies
Circuit breaker on downstream failures (auto_com_center, scholarship_api, auto_page_maker)
Retries with exponential backoff for transient errors
Configuration you must validate:
AUTH_ISSUER = https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
AUTH_AUDIENCE = scholar-platform
S2S_CLIENT_ID / S2S_CLIENT_SECRET for scholarship_agent
AUTO_COM_CENTER_URL = https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
SCHOLARSHIP_API_URL = https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Optional: AUTO_PAGE_MAKER_URL = https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
DRY_RUN_DEFAULT = true
Third-party systems required for you: None directly. SendGrid/Twilio are owned by auto_com_center; you only call its /api/notify. Use Sentry or equivalent for error reporting if available.

If NO-GO:
Provide ETA and ignition date; quantify the delay’s revenue impact per day until GO
Execution notes for Agent3 (you must complete these now)

Validate secrets via /ready and log missing envs
Acquire an M2M token from scholar_auth (document cURL)
Fetch a minimal candidate set from scholarship_api to exercise selection logic

Produce all four reports under evidence/ with the required headers:
APP NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
If not production-safe today, publish GO_DECISION with:
GO window in UTC (e.g., 2025-11-16 17:00–18:00 UTC)
ARR ignition date and model
Third-party/platform dependencies list with owners and ETAs
End of Master Orchestration Prompt for Agent3. Only execute SECTION-3 — scholarship_agent.
