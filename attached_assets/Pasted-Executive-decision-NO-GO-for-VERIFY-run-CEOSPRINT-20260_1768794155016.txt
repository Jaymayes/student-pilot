Executive decision: NO GO for VERIFY (run CEOSPRINT-20260113-VERIFY-ZT3G-046) due to network isolation in the execution environment. Proceed with code/application fixes and owner-side deployment; re-run verification once outbound DNS is restored.

What I’m approving now

Accept Phase 0.2 STOP as correct. The Manual Intervention Manifest you generated is our source of truth for Golden Path fixes.
Authorize external owners to apply and publish Golden Path changes for A1–A8 immediately.
Maintain B2C charges locked (SAFETY_LOCK_ACTIVE) until verification passes.
Owner actions (timeboxed)

Infra/Workspace (SLA: 4 hours)
Restore outbound DNS/internet for the verification runner or execute VERIFY from a runner with confirmed egress.
Confirm by posting: date/time, resolver config summary, “nslookup replit.app” proof, and a one-line traceroute or curl to example.com.
2. External App Owners (SLA: 12 hours)

Apply Golden Path from tests/perf/reports/manual_intervention_manifest.md:
Global: bind to 0.0.0.0:$PORT
A1: trust proxy + secure cookies (SameSite=None)
A5: Stripe guardrail (SAFETY_LOCK_ACTIVE) until CEO overrides
A6: /api/providers returns JSON array (not HTML)
A8: /api/events echoes X-Trace-Id and returns event_id
Publish each app (A1–A8) and post the deployment timestamp and commit hash.
3. Verification Lead (SLA: 24 hours post-publish)

Re-run: RUN_ID = CEOSPRINT-20260113-VERIFY-ZT3G-046
Deliverables to CEO channel:
A8 event_id proving telemetry ingestion
A6 /api/providers response (expects ≥3 providers)
Security headers snapshot (HSTS, CSP, XFO, XCTO)
Latency summary (P50/P95/P99) per app, 15-min window
SHA-256 artifact list regenerated under tests/perf/reports/ and tests/perf/evidence/
Go/No‑Go gates for “Definitive GO”

Connectivity: DNS ok; 8/8 URLs return HTTP 200 for ≥30 minutes
Performance: P95 ≤120ms (stretch), acceptable interim ≤150ms; no single app >170ms for >10 min
Telemetry: 100% ingestion; trace_id echoed by A8; second confirmation ≥2-of-3
Trust: FPR ≤5%, Precision ≥0.85, Recall ≥0.70 (current thresholds) with logs attached
B2B: /api/providers returns active providers; fee lineage shows 3% platform fee
B2C: charges remain blocked until above gates pass; then I will issue the micro‑charge pilot order
Contingency if egress cannot be restored within 8 hours

Execute VERIFY from an alternate CI runner with outbound access (GitHub Actions self‑hosted or Replit deployment runner)
Mirror artifacts back into tests/perf/reports/ and post run IDs
Why this matters (Prime Directive alignment)

Data-first: We will not claim “Verified Live” without real network validation and fresh artifacts.
CAC and SEO engine: A7/A8 fixes ensure Auto Page Maker scale-up won’t regress telemetry or trigger 429 storms during verify.
Revenue integrity: A5 Stripe guardrails prevent accidental live charges prior to CEO override.
Next update cadence

Infra status in 4 hours (egress restored or alternate runner selected)
Verification packet within 24 hours of publish
I will issue the B2C micro‑charge pilot authorization immediately after VERIFY passes all gates.
