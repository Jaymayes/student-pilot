CEO OPERATIONS ORDER — OPERATION SYNERGY (FOC)

Executive summary

System posture: FOC NO-GO. Single hard gate remains auto_com_center. All other services are either GO or GO (conditional) with short, contained actions to clear.
Prime objective alignment: Prioritize low-CAC organic growth (Auto Page Maker), reliable SSOT via scholarship_api, and frictionless B2C experience to drive free→paid conversion and ARPU. These are the economic levers most correlated with ARR growth in our playbook; we also intensify the Sage + Essay Coach synergy to lift conversion quality and depth of engagement .
Gate calls (effective immediately)

scholar_auth: GO (conditional). Condition: CORS env var update and verification within 15 minutes; JWKS and P95 must remain green. This aligns to centralized auth and API-as-a-product governance we enforce across the estate .
scholarship_api: GO. Maintain SSOT posture; standardized errors and observe-only event emissions preserved during comms NO-GO window. Our governance model requires consistent security and error contracts across all services .
scholarship_sage: GO. Support student_pilot E2E; keep P95 ≪120ms and RBAC enforced. Maintain model transparency and auditability consistent with our Responsible AI policy .
scholarship_agent: GO. Observe-only mode for events until comms GREEN. Circuit breakers remain armed; no outbound messaging fan-out while comms is red. This mirrors self-healing and circuit-breaker patterns we standardize to prevent cascades .
student_pilot: GO (conditional). Functionality verified; execute 30-sample auth success and latency runs and Lighthouse ≥90 before final GO. UX must remain frictionless; standardized error schema and security headers are non-negotiable per governance .
provider_register: NO-GO until OAuth client registration is verifiably green (see Orders #2). Data access must remain org-scoped and RBAC-tight.
auto_page_maker: GO. Continue SEO generation, maintain sitemap/IndexNow cadence, and protect CWV to keep low-CAC growth compounding. Asynchronous, event-driven deltas reduce cost and improve resiliency on Replit’s autoscale model .
auto_com_center: NO-GO (hard gate). Canary unstable. Must meet queue durability + delivery SLOs and compliance criteria before we open fan-out. Pattern: fix-forward with self-healing, bulkheads, circuit breakers, and canary rollback readiness .
Immediate executive decisions and orders

scholar_auth — CORS update (operator action, 10 minutes)
Action: Remove auto_com_center origin; keep provider_register, student_pilot, scholar_auth only.
Evidence required (post-change, within 5 minutes):
CORS preflight from student_pilot/provider_register returns expected allowlist.
JWKS reachable and stable.
Security headers: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy verified.
P95 ≤120ms maintained.
Rationale: Unified governance and edge controls start at auth; enforce least-privilege origins and stable discovery/JWKS to assure cross-service trust fabric .
2. provider_register — CEO exception approved now

Decision: APPROVED — Temporary OIDC client issuance (24-hour expiry) to unblock E2E immediately, in parallel with permanent registry reconciliation.
Requirements:
Strict origin lock to provider_register base URL, single redirect URI, PKCE S256, scopes limited to openid email profile roles offline_access.
Full audit of all auth attempts under the temp client; immutable audit trail retained (decision traceability) .
Remove temporary client within 24 hours once permanent registration is confirmed.
Additional directive: Auth DRI publishes the authoritative client registry snapshot (client_id, redirect_uris, scopes, created_at) to the program channel in 10 minutes to reconcile the “invalid_client” discrepancy. This is an approval-gate mechanism consistent with human-on-the-loop safeguards for high-impact config changes .
3. auto_com_center — unblock plan and budget

Budget release: APPROVE one-time $5k SRE capacity for heap/GC tuning, queue back-pressure policy, and canary hardening.
Exit criteria to flip GREEN:
Queue durability: zero message loss under 2x peak synthetic load.
Delivery SLOs: P95 dispatch <250ms via SMTP/SMS integrations; automatic retry with exponential backoff; no cascade on downstream timeouts (circuit breaker OPEN when needed) .
Compliance: Verified opt-out/unsubscribe flow; CAN-SPAM/GDPR evidence bundle prepared.
Rollback plan required: Canary traffic shifting with automatic rollback on anomaly, per service-mesh/gateway control-plane pattern. If available, use gateway policies for rate limiting and auth hardening at the edge .
4. student_pilot — evidence completion

Within 30 minutes:
Auth success ≥98% over 30 attempts.
P50/P95/P99 latency for top 5 endpoints captured; P95 ≤120ms.
Lighthouse accessibility ≥90.
HAR bundle + SHA256 manifest submitted.
Note: Frictionless UX is a top driver of activation; error patterns and header compliance must be consistent to maintain trust and conversion throughput .
5. scholarship_api — freeze discipline

Maintain SSOT and schema/API freeze until FOC declared. Keep event emissions in observe-only mode. This preserves our API-as-product discipline and stable lifecycle for autonomous agents and human developers alike .
6. scholarship_sage — responsible AI posture

Continue supporting student_pilot E2E. Ensure recommendation rationale is traceable for auditability. Maintain logs linking inputs, feature salience, and outputs to support explainability and bias reviews per our Responsible AI guardrails .
24-hour path to FOC (milestones and acceptance)

T+0: Orders issued (this memo).
T+10: scholar_auth CORS updated; evidence posted. If not complete, we halt all new E2E runs until closure.
T+15: provider_register temp client active; E2E starts. Registry snapshot posted by Auth DRI.
T+60–90: student_pilot final evidence bundle; provider_register E2E evidence bundle.
T+90: auto_com_center canary fix results posted; if GREEN, schedule DRY-RUN with scholarship_agent events. If YELLOW/RED, continue observe-only and re-run after fixes.
FOC GO decision window: After comms GREEN and both E2E bundles pass acceptance tests (auth ≥98%, P95 ≤120ms, 0 critical 5xx, standardized errors, RBAC verified).
Lifecycle and revenue cessation portfolio view

Infrastructure (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center): 5–7 years. Plan re-architecture window 2029–2032. Track identity evolution (FIDO2/WebAuthn, continuous/behavioral auth) and adopt unified API management/gateway for consistent policy, observability, and monetization levers .
User-facing (student_pilot, provider_register): 3–4 years. Major UI/UX overhaul likely in 2028–2029 to remain competitive; accessibility and speed baselines will rise.
Intelligence/Automation (scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker): 2–3 years. Refresh 2027–2028. Update models/embeddings and automation pipelines; maintain explainability and bias monitoring as first-class features .
Contingencies: Standards shifts (OIDC→passkeys), regulatory changes, and traffic scale beyond Replit’s sweet spot may bring some dates forward; adopting asynchronous patterns and event-driven deltas helps reduce cost and extend life on current infra .
Strategic alignment to $10M profitable ARR

B2C growth engine: Double down on Auto Page Maker SEO + fast CWV to drive low-CAC acquisition; every basis point of conversion at scale compounds. Asynchronous generation and hourly deltas minimize spend while maximizing index growth on Replit autoscale .
Conversion lift: Integrate Essay Coach narrative signals into Sage’s matching to improve “implicit fit,” the clearest opportunity to raise free→paid conversion and ARPU per our playbook analytics .
B2B leverage: Keep the SSOT stable and publish the first analytics suite increment to demonstrate provider value and support 3% fee capture .
Governance: Treat every API as a product; enforce unified security, observability, standardized errors, and human-on-the-loop approval gates for risky changes. This is the backbone that keeps autonomous operations safe and scalable .
Deliverables and owners (next 90 minutes)

Auth DRI (now +10): CORS change + evidence (see Order #1).
Auth DRI (now +10): Client registry snapshot (see Order #2).
provider_register DRI (now +15): Start E2E with temporary client; submit evidence by +105.
student_pilot DRI (now +30): Submit metrics and Lighthouse; deliver evidence bundle by +30.
Comms Infra + auto_com_center DRI (now +90): Canary stabilization results vs exit criteria; rollback plan documented.
Reporting cadence

30-minute cadence updates until FOC declared.
Mandatory Section 7 reports: If not already submitted, each DRI posts the standardized report within 2 hours. Ensure lifecycle/obsolescence estimates reflect category norms and our Responsible AI and governance commitments .
Final note
Act with urgency, maintain freeze discipline except for CEO-approved config and canary fixes, and keep the experience frictionless for students. Student value is our economic engine, and organic growth is our CAC advantage. We stay data-first and policy-driven as we clear the final gate to FOC.
