As CEO, here are my decisions and the immediate operating orders to hit our 72‑hour validation and unlock revenue. You noted all apps are published except provider_register—so we will validate B2C revenue now and parallel-path B2B go-live via a fast redeploy.

Executive decisions

Proceed now with auth and B2C revenue validation
scholar_auth: Run JWKS and /verify load tests now. Target P95 ≤120ms with evidence package.
student_pilot: Run a $1–$5 live Stripe purchase now. Verify credit ledger update in scholarship_api and receipt via auto_com_center. This is our “first live dollar.”
auto_com_center: Execute deliverability test (Welcome, Receipt, Match) to Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo immediately after the live purchase. Document inbox placement and authentication headers.
2. provider_register deployment: Option 1 approved (deploy to Vercel/Railway now)

Deploy immediately. Target 2–4 hours to live. Configure Stripe LIVE keys and webhook.
After deploy, run $5 live provider test payment via Stripe Connect and verify the 3% platform fee posts correctly.
3. scholarship_agent and scholarship_sage enhancements (6–24 hours)

scholarship_agent: Implement nightly matching cron and event logging to scholarship_api; both are required for match-driven retention metrics and growth dashboards.
scholarship_sage: Add telemetry tag guidance_only_enforced=true to every guidance response to verify Responsible AI guardrails in production.
4. SEO engine enablement (growth)

auto_page_maker: Prepare GSC step-by-step for the team and stand by. A human must submit and verify the sitemap. Post-submission, enable incremental publish cadence (200–500 pages/day) within 24–72 hours.
5. Data-first discipline

Do not report unverified traffic, conversion, or ARR numbers. All metrics must be backed by logs, dashboard screenshots, or data pulls. Replace estimates with “TBD” until instrumented.
Immediate tasking (0–6 hours)

Finance + Product: Complete $1–$5 live Stripe purchase in student_pilot; confirm ledger update in scholarship_api; confirm receipt email in inbox. Provide screenshots.
Ops/SRE: Run scholar_auth JWKS and /verify benchmarks; attach latency histogram and P95/P99. Provide evidence.
Comms/Ops: Execute email deliverability tests via auto_com_center; provide screenshots + headers confirming DKIM/SPF/DMARC alignment.
Engineering: Begin provider_register deployment to Vercel/Railway now; configure Stripe LIVE and webhook; confirm health and run $5 test as soon as live.

Acceptance criteria and evidence

First live dollar: Screenshot of Stripe charge, user credit balance after purchase, and receipt email delivered to inbox (not spam).
Auth performance: JWKS fetch and /verify P95 ≤120ms with graphs/logs.
Email deliverability: Inbox placement ≥95% across providers with headers showing DKIM/SPF/DMARC pass.
B2B readiness: provider_register live, $5 live payment confirmed, 3% platform fee verified in Stripe dashboard.
Next confirmations I need from you

Confirm the live Stripe purchase is completed and share evidence.
Confirm provider_register deployment is in progress (Vercel/Railway) and ETA.
Confirm the email deliverability screenshots and headers.
I will hold the organization to the above timeline and evidence. If any item risks slipping beyond the 6-hour window, escalate immediately with blocker, owner, and new ETA so we can reallocate or remove blockers.
