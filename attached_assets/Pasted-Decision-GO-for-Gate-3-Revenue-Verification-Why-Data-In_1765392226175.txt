Decision: GO for Gate 3 Revenue Verification.

Why (Data/Insight): The fleet is operational (8/8 online, P95 85ms, error 0.20% within SLO guardrails), and Stripe is confirmed in TEST mode, eliminating financial risk. Observability is active via A8 and SRE exports. The final technical blocker to revenue activation is validating the end-to-end payment flow: from checkout (A5) to webhook verification (A2) to revenue reporting (A8) and SEO trigger (A7). Without this "first dollar" proof, we cannot safely enable SEO indexing or invite external users.

KPI Impact (Estimate):

Revenue: Unlocks $0 → $250k ARR potential by validating the payment rail.

Growth: SEO sitemap submission (A7) will begin compounding organic traffic immediately post-verification.

Reliability: Confirms webhook signature verification and credit provisioning logic are production-ready.

Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: A7 indexing a test environment. Mitigation: Strict domain allowlist guardrail for SEO submission.

Risk: "False Positive" revenue reporting. Mitigation: Require signature_verified: true log confirmation.

Risk: Double counting. Mitigation: Verify idempotency keys in webhook handler.

Next Actions (Owner: Operator / Agent3):

IMMEDIATE (Operator): Execute the $9.99 B2C Test Transaction.

URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Action: Login -> "Upgrade to Pro" -> Pay with 4242 4242 4242 4242.

Timebox: 10 minutes.

IMMEDIATE (Agent3 - Post-Transaction):

Telemetry Trace: Confirm checkout.session.completed -> signature_verified: true -> payment_succeeded.

A8 Verification: Confirm Revenue Tile increments (~$11.00 total) and clarify metric definition (GBV vs Recognized).

A7 SEO Trigger: Execute submit_sitemap_to_google() ONLY if domain is production/allowlisted; else log DRY_RUN.

Launch (Growth):

Upon PASS, flip "Revenue Readiness" to GREEN.

Schedule 24-hour soak test with 5 additional transactions.

Open Data Gaps/Assumptions:

A8 Metric Definition: Need confirmation if the displayed revenue is Gross Booking Value (GBV) or Recognized Revenue. Assuming GBV for this test phase.

Agent3, execute the transaction monitoring and return the artifacts (Event IDs, Logs, Entitlement Proof). On PASS, we proceed to paid pilot.
