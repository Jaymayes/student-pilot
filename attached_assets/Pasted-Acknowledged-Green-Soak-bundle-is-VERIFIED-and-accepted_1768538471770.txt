Acknowledged. Green + Soak bundle is VERIFIED and accepted.

Orders: proceed to the next two milestones on schedule.

09:35Z — Contract Integrity Report (deliver exactly)

Builds and scope
stable_build_id (A6) and candidate_build_id (A6) + digests
A3 orchestration build_id that exercised the contracts
CDC test matrix (must attach evidence_hash and CI job links)
Endpoints: /provider/register, /provider/onboard, /provider/status, /provider/account-link, /provider/webhooks/stripe
Request/response schema diffs: body, headers, enums, date/time formats, idempotency semantics
Status code map: 2xx, 4xx (throttles, validation, idempotency replay), 5xx (none expected)
Error shape invariants: code, message, details[], correlation_id
Negative tests: invalid idempotency_key, duplicate transaction_id, revoked provider capability, webhook signature mismatch
Limits and timeouts: per-endpoint latency P95 and hard timeouts; rate-limit headers present and documented
Security/PII: no PII in logs; COPPA/FERPA flags preserved; canonical redaction patterns applied
Stripe integration stubs vs live probes alignment; webhook idempotency guarantees verified
Results rubric (must be GREEN to pass)
Schema drift: NONE
Status code drift: NONE
Error-shape drift: NONE
Latency and rate-limit behavior: within guardrails
Evidence: event_id + evidence_hash for the CI suite and artifacts
09:45Z — Final Pre‑Canary Checklist (all must be TRUE; attach event_id + evidence_hash)

Health: P95 <1.25s; error <0.5%; reserves ≥15%; backlog <10; DLQ = 0
Stripe live probes ≥99.5%: create_account, account_links, payouts (last 50)
Budget <80%; compute ≤2x baseline
Breaker = CLOSED; canonical_ledger_hash present
Risk governors ARMED: global GMV cap ($100k, 80% pre‑throttle), provider hourly ($10k hold+page), concentration (>25% hold+page)
Rollback readiness: rollback_build_id + digest; health probe PASS; warm cache READY
Allowlist: org_ids/emails/acct_ids for 1% internal/pilot cohort validated
10:05Z — Gate 3 execution plan (authorized if both above PASS)

Step 1 canary: 1% allowlist for 10 min
Budget cap: $500
Evidence heartbeat every 60s: p95, error, backlog, dlq, reserves, budget, compute, stripe_success, breaker_state, evidence_hash
Auto‑halt/rollback (any for 60s unless immediate noted):
P95 ≥1.5s or error ≥1.0%
backlog >30 (immediate), DLQ >0 (immediate)
Stripe success <99.5% (last 50)
Budget ≥80% or compute >2x baseline
Schema/telemetry violation (non‑anchored packet) (immediate)
If Step 1 PASS: escalate 5% → 25% → 100% (10 min each), same gates
External comms: SILENT until Step 3 (25%) passes; then prepare “All‑clear” draft but hold for CEO approval
Rollback: single‑click revert to rollback_build_id; breaker remains CLOSED; revert CTAs to hidden
Pages I expect

09:35Z Contract Integrity Report: event_id + evidence_hash, GREEN summary
09:45Z Pre‑Canary Checklist: recommendation = GO, event_id + evidence_hash
10:05Z Gate 3 decision + Step‑1 start (or HOLD with reason and action)
Proceed.
