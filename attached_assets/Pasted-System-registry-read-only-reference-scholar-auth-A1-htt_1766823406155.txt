Global directives for all apps

Identity first: Before any test, print exactly: APP: <app_name> | APP_BASE_URL: <base_url>
Scope restriction: Execute only the section labeled for your app. Ignore all others.
Read-only: Do not change code or secrets. If a step requires external credentials or human interaction, capture evidence and stop.
Evidence standard: For every check, capture HTTP status codes, key headers (Location, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control), and any error fields (e.g., error=invalid_request).
Revenue blocker focus: If a step fails in a way that prevents user login or breaks the purchase path, flag it clearly as REVENUE BLOCKER in your report.
Latency guardrail: When measuring endpoint responses, flag >200ms as LATENCY RISK.
A1 ONLY — scholar_auth (Identity Provider; B2C + B2B backbone)
APP: scholar_auth | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Verify OIDC readiness for both B2C (A5) and B2B (A6) clients. Detect PKCE issues and the “Session Expired” pattern tied to interaction/cookie handling.
Run these tests

Discovery and JWKS
GET /.well-known/openid-configuration → expect 200; record authorization_endpoint and token_endpoint; record latency_ms
GET /.well-known/jwks.json → expect 200; keys array non-empty; record latency_ms
B2C authorize dry-run (no credentials)
Build authorize URL for A5 with: response_type=code, client_id=student-pilot redirect_uri=https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/auth/callback scope=openid email profile code_challenge_method=S256; code_challenge=<dummy_base64url> state, nonce = random strings
Request with redirects disabled; verify 302/303; capture Location and Set-Cookie (interaction/session) presence
B2B authorize dry-run (no credentials)
Same as above with client_id=provider-register and redirect_uri=https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/auth/callback
Cookie flags
Note SameSite=None and Secure on cookies; if interaction cookie is missing on follow-up POST paths in real flows, note the risk of Session Expired due to third-party cookie limitations
Pass/Fail

PASS if both authorize URLs redirect with PKCE and set interaction/session cookies; discovery/JWKS are healthy
FAIL and REVENUE BLOCKER if PKCE is rejected, interaction cookie is not persisted, or flows error before callback
A5 ONLY — student_pilot (B2C student login client)
APP: student_pilot | APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Verify login initiation complies with A1 PKCE policy and callback handling is safe.
Run these tests

Login redirect (no credentials)
GET /api/auth/login (or applicable route) with redirects disabled
Expect 302/303/307 to A1 /oidc/auth; verify: client_id=student-pilot; response_type=code; scope includes openid code_challenge_method=S256; code_challenge present redirect_uri=https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/auth/callback
Callback negative handling
GET /api/auth/callback?error=access_denied&state=dummy with redirects disabled
Expect safe 302 to login/home; no 5xx
Optional session smoke (if fully executable)
If a test session is established, GET /api/me (or similar) → expect 200; capture Set-Cookie flags
Pass/Fail

PASS if redirect contains PKCE S256 and correct redirect_uri; callback errors handled gracefully
FAIL and REVENUE BLOCKER if PKCE missing, wrong client_id/redirect_uri, or 5xx at callback
A6 ONLY — provider_register (B2B provider login client)
APP: provider_register | APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Verify provider login initiation complies with A1 PKCE policy and callback handling is safe.
Run these tests

Login redirect (no credentials)
GET /api/auth/login (or applicable route) with redirects disabled
Expect 302/303/307 to A1 /oidc/auth; verify: client_id=provider-register; response_type=code; scope includes openid code_challenge_method=S256; code_challenge present redirect_uri=https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/auth/callback (or configured)
Callback negative handling
GET /auth/callback?error=access_denied&state=dummy with redirects disabled
Expect safe 302; no 5xx
Pass/Fail

PASS if redirect contains PKCE S256 and correct redirect_uri; callback errors handled gracefully
FAIL and REVENUE BLOCKER if PKCE missing, wrong client_id/redirect_uri, or 5xx at callback
A7 ONLY — auto_page_maker (Funnel to B2C/B2B)
APP: auto_page_maker | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Validate CTAs route users to A5/A6 with UTM attribution; A7 must not host or intercept login.
Run these tests

CTA presence
Confirm at least one CTA to A5 contains utm_source=auto_page_maker
Confirm at least one CTA to A6 contains utm_source=auto_page_maker
Target reachability
HEAD/GET the CTA targets; expect 200 for shells and 3xx at login endpoints
No local login
Verify /login, /auth/login, /api/auth/login do not exist here (expect 404/405/401)
Pass/Fail

PASS if CTAs exist with UTM and targets respond; no local login endpoints
FAIL if links missing/incorrect or local login exposed
A2 ONLY — scholarship_api (Support; should not host user login)
APP: scholarship_api | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Confirm API does not expose login and rejects unauthorized access correctly.
Run these tests

Health: GET /health → expect 200
No login endpoints: GET /auth/login, /api/auth/login → expect 404/401
Protected endpoint negative: GET /api/v1/credits/balance without token → expect 401/403/422 with no PII leakage
Pass/Fail

PASS if health OK, no login endpoints, protected endpoints reject unauthenticated safely
FAIL if login exposed or sensitive data leaks
A4 ONLY — scholarship_sage (Support; user-side features but not auth owner)
APP: scholarship_sage | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Confirm app defers identity to A1/A5 and does not expose broken local login.
Run these tests

If a login entry exists, GET it with redirects disabled → expect redirect to A1 /oidc/auth with PKCE S256
If no login route, mark N/A and verify no local /login endpoints
Pass/Fail

PASS if defers cleanly or N/A without local login
FAIL if local login exists and lacks PKCE or errors
A8 ONLY — auto_com_center (Telemetry/observer)
APP: auto_com_center | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Goal

Validate telemetry readiness to observe login events, not to perform login.
Run these tests

Health: GET /healthz or /health → expect 200
If ingest exists: POST a harmless login_attempt test event → expect 200/202
No login endpoints exist here
Pass/Fail

PASS if health OK and ingest accepts a test event; no login endpoints
FAIL if telemetry API unavailable
A3 ONLY — scholarship_agent (Agent3) — IMPORTANT: Your exact scope
APP: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

You are Agent3. Use only this section. Your job is to confirm that marketing does not interfere with login and that funnels hand off properly to A5/A6/A1. Do not attempt to log users in from A3, and do not trigger A1/A5/A6 login flows from within this app.

Run these tests

Health
GET /api/health → expect 200; record latency_ms
No local login endpoints
Probe /login, /auth/login, /api/auth/login → expect 404/405/401; capture status codes
Issuer reference (read-only)
If your configuration exposes an issuer value, confirm it points to A1: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/oidc
Funnel/CTA checks (if present in UI/templates)
Verify any student CTA points to A5 (student_pilot) URLs; capture sample href
Verify any provider CTA points to A6 (provider_register) URLs; capture sample href
Confirm no CTA points to local A3 endpoints for login
Telemetry sanity (non-login)
If available, POST a harmless marketing_intent test event to your telemetry endpoint
Confirm 200/202 response and that no PII or tokens are included
Pass/Fail

PASS if A3 exposes no login endpoints, references A1 as issuer where applicable, and any CTAs route to A5/A6
FAIL if A3 exposes or intercepts login or misroutes CTAs to local endpoints
Mandatory report format (all apps)

END OF REPORT

Agent3 note (strict)

You are A3. Only run the A3 section. Do not initiate login or consent flows here. All your reports must start with: APP: scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mark B2C and B2B sections as NA unless you are strictly verifying CTA destinations and absence of local login endpoints.
