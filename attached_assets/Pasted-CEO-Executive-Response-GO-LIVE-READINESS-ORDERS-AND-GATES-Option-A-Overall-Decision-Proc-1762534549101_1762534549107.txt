CEO Executive Response — GO-LIVE READINESS, ORDERS, AND GATES (Option A)

Overall Decision

Proceed with Option A. Hard gate remains: P95 ≤120ms for authorize, token, jwks, discovery by 00:00 UTC; slip allowed to 00:15 UTC. If the gate is not met at 00:15 UTC, NO-GO and slip +24h.
We do not accept YELLOW on JWKS. Bring JWKS ≤120ms P95.
Critical Execution Orders (effective immediately)

Auth DRI (owner: @auth-lead)

Register three OAuth clients now and signal completion:
student-pilot: authorization_code + refresh_token, PKCE S256, redirect: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/callback
provider-register: authorization_code + refresh_token, PKCE S256, redirect: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/callback
scholarship_sage: client_credentials with read-only scopes (student.read, scholarship.read, scholarship.search or equivalent)
Execute latency optimizations before 23:45 UTC:
Pre-warm authorize, token, discovery, jwks for 10 minutes at 30–50 RPS (keep-alive on).
Enable connection pooling to DB/IDP dependencies (reuse agents/HTTP keep-alive).
Add in-memory cache for discovery + JWKS (TTL 300s; ETag; Cache-Control: public, max-age=300, stale-while-revalidate=30).
Precompute JWKS JSON and ETag in-memory on boot; avoid per-request crypto/serialization.
Preload client metadata and hot path checks.
Metrics cadence: Post p50/p95 by endpoint every 20 minutes (rolling 15-min window) plus error rates and sample sizes.
AUTH_FIXLOG: Maintain in scholar_auth repo. Include timestamps, diffs, metrics before/after, and owners for each change. Post initial entry within 15 minutes.
Agent3 (auto_com_center) — continue as coordination hub

Maintain war-room cadence and evidence intake. Do not attempt auth execution. Keep all DRI owners on schedule.
Keep DELIVERABILITY_SNAPSHOT on track for 00:00 UTC.
Student DRI

Re-run PKCE flow for student_pilot immediately upon Auth DRI’s “clients registered” signal; produce E2E evidence within 30 minutes of AUTH GREEN TAG.
Provider DRI

Execute ORDER_B within 60 minutes of AUTH GREEN TAG.
Stripe production verification must be complete by 22:00 UTC:
Live keys present; webhook secret verified; 3% platform fee transparency captured in evidence.
If Stripe prod cannot be verified by 22:00 UTC, hold ORDER_B and alert IC.
Sage DRI

Execute 3-grant M2M validation within 30 minutes of AUTH GREEN TAG and deliver evidence (latency, scope enforcement, request_id lineage).
API DRI

Monitor 401/5xx during JWKS rehearsal (23:30–23:45 UTC) and at AUTH GREEN TAG window. Provide cross-app traces (auth→api→app) for evidence by ~01:30 UTC.
Comms DRI (auto_com_center)

SendGrid: Verify DKIM/SPF/DMARC “verified” status and production sender by 20:30 UTC; share test deliverability results (seed list).
Twilio SMS (if used tonight): Confirm A2P 10DLC registration and campaign approved; otherwise disable SMS for tonight and note in snapshot.
War-Room Timeline (UTC)

19:00: Auth: “Clients registered” signal due; Metrics Snapshot #1
19:20: Metrics Snapshot #2
20:00: War-room opens; 30-min checkpoints
23:30–23:45: JWKS rehearsal; all DRIs monitor; API DRI on 401/5xx
23:45: P95 checkpoint — all four endpoints trending ≤120ms
00:00: AUTH GREEN TAG gate (slip allowed to 00:15)
00:30: student_pilot E2E evidence due
01:00: provider_register ORDER_B evidence due
~01:30: scholarship_api ORDER_4 addendum due
Go/No-Go Criteria (must all be true at the gate)

scholar_auth: P95 ≤120ms for authorize, token, jwks, discovery over a rolling 15-min window; error rate ≤0.5%; zero invalid_client since registration.
JWKS rotation rehearsal yields zero validation errors across clients.
scholarship_api: 401/5xx within budget (<1%) during and after rehearsal; token validation continuity intact.
student_pilot: PKCE flow success and protected routes pass-through.
provider_register: PKCE + fee capture verified in evidence; Stripe production confirmed (keys + webhook).
scholarship_sage: M2M client_credentials success; read-only scopes enforced.
Risk Controls

If JWKS remains >120ms P95 after caching/precompute:
Increase JWKS cache TTL to 600s temporarily with stale-while-revalidate=60; confirm auditability.
Ensure HTTP keep-alive pool tuned to peak concurrent; avoid cold starts by pre-warming every 5 minutes until gate.
If still failing at 00:15 UTC: NO-GO and slip +24h. Protect trust/SLOs.
ARR Impact and Targets

If AUTH GREEN tonight:
B2C upsell: +48h (earliest 2025-11-10 00:00 UTC).
B2B 3% platform fee: upon ORDER_B completion (earliest 2025-11-08 01:30–03:00 UTC).
Auto Page Maker continues CAC-lean compounding regardless of gate outcome; no changes through Nov 12.

Final Note
Quality and trust over speed. If P95 ≤120ms is not achieved by 00:15 UTC, we NO-GO and slip 24 hours. Auto Page Maker continues to compound organic demand; ARR ignition remains intact with minimal schedule impact.
