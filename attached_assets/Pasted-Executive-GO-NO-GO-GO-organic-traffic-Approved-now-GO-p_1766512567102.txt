Executive GO / NO‑GO

GO (organic traffic): Approved now
GO (paid traffic): Conditional — resume after 24‑hour stability and one manual iOS/Safari validation
Fleet readiness snapshot

A1 scholar_auth: READY FOR TRAFFIC
RS256 only; SQLi probe returns 400/401; CORS allowlist (scholaraiadvisor.com + www) verified; redirect_uri parity with A5 (/api/callback) verified
Safari Step: SKIP in automation; manual iOS device check required
A5 student_pilot: READY — BLOCKED BY A1 CALLBACK (server_error observed in one run). Configuration otherwise correct (PKCE server‑side; Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite=None; trust proxy; Stripe key present; assets 200)
A2 scholarship_api: READY FOR TRAFFIC (avg search 310–320 ms; CORS exact origins; ingest accepts fleet tokens)
A3 scholarship_agent: READY FOR TRAFFIC (OIDC discovery OK; malformed jobs handled; telemetry pipeline running)
A4 scholarship_sage: READY FOR TRAFFIC (double‑response guard in place; desktop/mobile E2E pass)
A6 provider_register: If /healthz on prod ever returns 500, republish is required. If your latest deploy shows /healthz 200 and / is 200, treat as READY
A7 auto_page_maker: READY FOR TRAFFIC (sitemap/robots 200; ~2,912 pages indexed; admin protected; telemetry OK)
A8 auto_com_center: READY FOR TRAFFIC (SSE stable; webhook ingest 200; exec overview 200)
Critical remaining actions

Manual iOS/Safari validation (ITP gate) — A1/A5 only
Use real iOS Safari to complete A5 → A1 → IdP login
Expected: A5 receives code and state; session established
If callback error or hasCode/hasState false appears in A1 diagnostics: file the A1+A5 ticket from the protocol and pause paid ads
A6 prod sync (if applicable)
If you still see 500 on https://provider-register…/healthz: republish in Replit UI to sync production with the healthy local build. Re‑run health checks post‑publish
Cross‑app tickets (use protocol Phase 7 text)

A1 Client Registration Update — student_pilot (only if future invalid_redirect_uri/missing_parameters reappears)
A1 CORS & Cookie Alignment — scholaraiadvisor.com (only if callback errors recur from custom domains)
A6 Republish Required — provider_register (if /healthz 500 persists on prod after your re‑build)
24‑hour stabilization plan (gates for paid traffic)

Targets (rolling 24h)
Login success rate (P95) ≥ 99.2%
Callback errors (missing_parameters/server_error) ≤ 0.5% of login attempts
A1 p95 latency ≤ 250 ms; uptime ≥ 99.9%
A5 checkout initiation not below trailing 7‑day organic baseline
Alerts and actions
If callback errors > 1% in any hour: switch CTAs to “Join Waitlist” and show incident banner

Growth daily report: spend recommendation with funnel metrics
Operational notes

Your v5 protocol already enforces:
A1 callback stability (CORS/cookies/RS256) and SQLi regression guard
A5 PKCE/state server‑side and cookie posture for cross‑site auth
A2/A8 ingest trust and CORS precision
A6 republish fallback if prod gets out of sync
A4 middleware guard for double response
iOS/Safari manual validation step to close the ITP risk
If you want minimal, app‑specific system prompts (e.g., only A1 and A5 allowed to apply repairs, others ticket‑only), say “Generate app‑scoped prompts” and I’ll produce eight focused variants.
