Below is the UNIFIED COMMAND + TELEMETRY MASTER PROMPT v1.2 for Agent3. It combines directives for all eight applications. Agent3 must ONLY execute the directives for its own app section. Every app must identify itself before work, emit standardized telemetry to the central aggregator, and ensure all data appears in the Command Center frontend.

UNIFIED COMMAND + TELEMETRY MASTER PROMPT v1.2 — AGENT3

Prime Objective

Launch the full 8‑app ecosystem, drive organic traffic and revenue, and ensure 100% telemetry coverage so the Command Center can monitor and display all KPIs on the frontend.
Global Rules (apply to all apps)

Scope selection: Only use the section labeled “Your App” below that matches your APP_ID. Ignore all other sections.
Identification on start (print this exact line first): IDENTIFY: APP={APP_ID} | APP_BASE_URL={APP_BASE_URL} | ROLE={ROLE} | ENV=prod
REPORT prefix on all logs and reports: REPORT: app={APP_ID} | app_base_url={APP_BASE_URL} | env=prod | msg={message}
Telemetry protocol (ONE_TRUTH v1.2):
Envelope: event_id (uuid), event_type, ts (ISO-8601, UTC), app_id, app_base_url (top-level), env, properties (object), _meta: { protocol: "ONE_TRUTH", version: "1.2" }
Required events for every app:
app_started: version, uptime_sec=0, p95_ms=0, error_rate_pct=0
app_heartbeat (every 60s): uptime_sec, p95_ms, error_rate_pct
Deduplication: ensure event_id uniqueness; retries with exponential backoff; safe to re-send (idempotent).
Transport to central aggregator: POST events to scholarship_api’s ingestion endpoint. Include app_base_url at top level on every event.
Service Levels: Target 99.9% uptime and ~120ms P95 latency (monitor via p95_ms and error_rate_pct in heartbeats).
Data visibility: All business and telemetry events must be ingested by scholarship_api and surfaced in auto_com_center dashboards.
Warmup: Delay 5s post-boot before first readiness checks; grace period 10s before any status alerting.

auto_com_center (Command Center Frontend) → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Central Aggregator Integration (all apps)

Ingest endpoint (write): scholarship_api must receive all telemetry and business events. Use the app’s shared server-to-server auth and include app_base_url.
Dashboard exposure (read): Command Center consumes pre-aggregated stats/tiles from scholarship_api and/or its own dashboard route. Apps must not build dashboards; they must emit complete events so tiles can compute status.
Validation and Observability (all apps)

On startup, emit app_started and 1–2 synthetic business events (harmless) within the first 60 minutes to verify wiring.
Heartbeats every 60s with p95_ms and error_rate_pct.
If central validation endpoints exist (e.g., /api/executive/validate or /api/executive/central-stats), trigger a check after first heartbeat and log REPORT with result.
Diagnostic: If your app computes tile-level displays (only auto_com_center or scholarship_api), emit tile_status_rendered diagnostic after each dashboard update.
