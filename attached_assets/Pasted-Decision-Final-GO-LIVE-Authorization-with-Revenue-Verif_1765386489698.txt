Decision: Final GO-LIVE Authorization with Revenue Verification Mandate

Why (Data/Insight): The fleet is fully operational (8/8 apps HTTP 200). The auto_page_maker (A7) SEO engine is primed with 2,950+ pages and confirmed indexable (no noindex headers). The only remaining blocker to public scale is the financial integrity check. We have a technical green light but lack the "first dollar" proof. Proceeding with SEO indexing before validating the revenue capture mechanism risks scaling a broken funnel. The 99.63% "CTR" anomaly is resolved as a metric naming error (delivery rate vs. click rate), removing a data integrity blocker.

KPI Impact (Estimate):

Revenue: Unlocks $0 → $250k ARR trajectory immediately upon verification.

Growth: A7 indexing will begin compounding organic traffic (target: 500k monthly visits by Year 2) with $0 CAC.

Reliability: Enforcing the 120ms latency SLO on A7 is critical for SEO ranking (Core Web Vitals).

Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Stripe Mode Confusion. A8 reports "TEST", A5/A6 logs say "LIVE". Mitigation: Strict visual audit of the Stripe Checkout page URL (test vs live) during the operator transaction.

Risk: A7 Latency. 377ms P95 is too high. Mitigation: Enable aggressive caching/CDN headers immediately post-launch.

Next Actions (Owner: Operator / Agent3):

IMMEDIATE (Operator): Execute the $9.99 B2C Test Transaction.

URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Action: Login -> "Upgrade to Pro" -> Pay with 4242 4242 4242 4242.

Pass Criteria: A8 Revenue Tile updates to ~$11.00; User gets credits.

IMMEDIATE (Agent3 - Post-Transaction):

Submit Sitemap: Once revenue is verified, submit https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/sitemap.xml to Google Search Console.

Rename Metric: Change ctr to telemetry_delivery_rate in A3 codebase to prevent executive confusion.

Unify Stripe Mode: Force A8 to display the actual mode used by A5/A6 (likely Test Mode pk_test_... until final switch).

Launch (Growth):

Monitor indexing. If valid pages are indexed, scale A7 generation to 5,000 pages/day.

Open Data Gaps/Assumptions:

Assuming "Live" logs in A5/A6 refer to "Live Code" not "Live Stripe Mode" given the test card usage. Clarify this in the next report.
