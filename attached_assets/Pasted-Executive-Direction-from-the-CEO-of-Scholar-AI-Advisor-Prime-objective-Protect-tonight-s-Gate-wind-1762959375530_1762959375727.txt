Executive Direction from the CEO of Scholar AI Advisor
Prime objective: Protect tonight’s Gate windows, preserve ARR ignition Nov 13–15, and maintain compliance and performance guardrails.

Decisions and directives

ESP/DKIM plan (auto_com_center)
Primary: Stay on Postmark for Gate A tonight.
Contingency: Pre-stage SendGrid DNS and credentials now, but do not pivot unless the below conditions fail by the decision deadline.
Deadlines and criteria

14:00 UTC checkpoint: Publish “IN PROGRESS – DNS propagation underway” if DKIM is not yet green. Proceed. Approved.
15:30 UTC internal readiness check:
Required on Postmark: SPF pass, DKIM verified (green), DMARC policy published (p=none acceptable for Gate A), webhooks live, seed-list test plan queued.
16:00 UTC pivot decision rule:
Pivot to SendGrid only if BOTH conditions hold:
Postmark DKIM still not verified OR verified but seed-list test cannot achieve ≥95% inbox placement on Gmail/Outlook/iCloud within 30 minutes, and
SendGrid domain and DKIM are already verified and ready to send immediately.
If SendGrid DNS is not fully verified by 16:00 UTC, do not pivot; remain on Postmark and continue monitoring.
20:00–20:15 UTC Gate A execution criteria (must all pass):
Deliverability: ≥95% inbox placement on the 20-address seed list with aligned SPF/DKIM/DMARC
Latency: P95 send API ≤120 ms across 500 test sends
Reliability: Process 30,000 event webhooks in staging replay without data loss; end-to-end request_id lineage present in logs and BI sink
Error rate: <0.1% for send API and webhook processing over the test window
Evidence: Headers (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), seed-list outcomes, Prometheus/ELK screenshots, webhook replay metrics, request_id traces; bundle published within 30 minutes of completion
2. Secrets and credentials

Immediate: Obtain required credentials via secure secret management only. No plaintext secrets in code or chat. Rotate any keys exposed during testing post-Gate A.
Required variables for auto_com_center: POSTMARK_API_TOKEN, FROM_EMAIL, Return-Path domain; and pre-staged SendGrid keys if contingency is invoked.
DMARC posture: Keep p=none through Gate A; escalate to p=quarantine after warm-up performance stabilizes and complaint rate ≤0.1% for 72 hours.
3. Role and repo access clarity

auto_com_center: You are DRI with write access. If you do not currently have repo access, request and obtain it from DevOps immediately. If access is not granted by 05:30 UTC, command the current auto_com_center DRI to execute the DKIM/verifications and deliver evidence to you. You remain accountable for Gate A readiness.
provider_register: You are Release Captain only. Do not write code. Confirm the 18:00–18:15 UTC test window and evidence bundle with their DRI. If no evidence by 18:20 UTC, issue FAIL and escalate to me with a one-line cause and a one-hour remediation plan.
scholarship_api and scholar_auth: Coordination only. Enforce evidence discipline and gates; no code.
4. Legal and compliance holds

student_pilot: COPPA age gate must remain OFF until Legal signs at 18:00 UTC. Do not override. No B2C traffic ramp until Gate A (auto_com_center) and Gate C (scholar_auth) pass, and Legal confirms consent flows. This protects risk, brand, and long-term ARR.
5. ARR and growth guardrails

ARR ignition target remains Nov 13–15. A same-day ESP pivot is acceptable only if it preserves Gate A tonight with verifiable deliverability; otherwise it risks cold-domain warm-up drag. The default is Postmark with monitoring; pivot only under the 16:00 UTC rule above.
CAC discipline: Continue prioritizing organic/SEO (Auto Page Maker) and defer any paid spend until Gate A and Gate C pass and initial conversion telemetry confirms the funnel.
Section V status confirmations

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: IN PROGRESS (Gate A tonight)

What’s done: DNS records added; DKIM propagation pending; webhooks, rate limiting, dashboards prepared; 1-click activation/rollback procedures documented.
Blockers: DNS propagation timing; secrets must be injected via vault.
Go/No-Go plan: As above. Publish 14:00 UTC checkpoint as “IN PROGRESS – DNS propagation underway.” Approved.
Evidence to publish: DKIM/SPF/DMARC headers, seed-list results, API latency P95, webhook replay metrics, request_id traces.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Observer Mode)

Action: Remain blocked from campaign sends until Gate A and Gate C pass and Legal signs off. Warm-up starts only after my greenlight.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Conditional GO)

Blockers: COPPA age gate pending Legal at 18:00 UTC; dependent on Gate A and Gate C.
Estimated Go-Live: Nov 13, 16:00 UTC contingent on passes.
ARR ignition: Nov 13–15 remains on plan.
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: PENDING Gate B

18:00–18:15 UTC: Execute tests per plan.
18:15 UTC: Evidence due.
18:20 UTC: You issue PASS/FAIL. If FAIL or no evidence, escalate to me with remediation path.
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: PENDING Gate C

Requirement: P95 ≤120 ms, 99.9% availability, RBAC verified, SSO/MFA functioning, audit logs and request_id lineage confirmed. Run at 20:00–20:15 UTC.
Direct answers to your explicit questions

Publish the 14:00 UTC checkpoint as “IN PROGRESS – DNS propagation underway”? Yes. Do it.
If Postmark is not verified by 16:00 UTC, execute SendGrid pivot? Conditional yes: Only pivot if SendGrid domain/DKIM are already verified and seed-list deliverability can be proven within the hour; otherwise, hold on Postmark and continue to monitor. Do not risk a cold-domain warm-up that jeopardizes tonight’s Gate A.
Evidence discipline

All artifacts must be published per app at /evidence/YYYYMMDD/ with SHA-256 manifests, screenshots, and raw logs. Summaries are insufficient; include machine-verifiable proof.
Final note
Act with urgency, preserve tonight’s gates, and keep the operation lean and data-first. Escalate immediately if any gate risks slipping beyond its window.
