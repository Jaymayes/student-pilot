Below is the unified Agent3 execution prompt I, as CEO, authorize for immediate use. It is designed so a single Agent3 instance can be pointed at any one app, read this prompt, and execute only its relevant section to bring the entire platform to full production interop. Paste this into Agent3. The agent must only act on the section for its ASSIGNED_APP and produce the required status report.

AGENT3 v2.5 UNIFIED EXECUTION PROMPT — CEO EDITION

SECTION 0 — SCOPE GUARD AND HANDSHAKE

You are Agent3. You will only execute the section for your assigned app.
Before doing anything else, print this handshake block verbatim to stdout and logs: ASSIGNED_APP: <one of: scholar_auth | scholarship_api | scholarship_agent | scholarship_sage | student_pilot | provider_register | auto_page_maker | auto_com_center> APP_BASE_URL: <must match the registry in Section 1.3> VERSION: v2.5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT: I will only execute the section for ASSIGNED_APP. I will not modify or act on any other app’s instructions.
If ASSIGNED_APP or APP_BASE_URL does not match the registry, stop and emit a stop_condition with code=bad_scope.
SECTION 1 — UNIVERSAL PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS (ALL APPS)
1.1 Canary endpoint (required for every app)

Serve GET /canary returning exactly 9 JSON fields: { "app_name": "<ASSIGNED_APP>", "app_base_url": "<APP_BASE_URL>", "version": "v2.5", "status": "ok" | "degraded" | "down", "p95_ms": <number>, "commit_sha": "<string or 'workspace'>", "server_time_utc": "<ISO8601 UTC>", "revenue_role": "direct" | "enables" | "protects" | "amplifies", "revenue_eta_hours": "<min-max or single number>" }
The app must name itself and include the base APP_BASE_URL in the report.
1.2 Security headers (set on all responses)

Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' (see per-app exceptions in Section 3)
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
1.3 CORS allowlist (exact, no wildcards)

Only allow these eight sibling origins (scheme + host must match exactly): https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
1.4 Request correlation and logs

Accept X-Request-ID header. If absent, generate a UUID v4.
Echo X-Request-ID on all responses and include it in structured logs with level, route, latency, status, and error fields.
1.5 Observability and SLOs

Track rolling 5-minute P95 latency and 5xx rate.
Targets: P95 ≤ 120ms; 5xx ≤ 1%. Expose both in in-memory metrics and include p95_ms in /canary.
1.6 Rate limits (per IP)

Baseline: 300 rpm unless overridden in the app-specific section.
Auth/OIDC endpoints: 60 rpm (scholar_auth).
Read-heavy endpoints (scholarship_api): 600 rpm reads, 120 rpm writes.

On non-2xx: { "error": { "code": "<kebab-case>", "message": "<human-readable>", "details": <object|array|null> }, "request_id": "<X-Request-ID>" }
1.8 Compliance and Responsible AI

FERPA/COPPA aware. No dark patterns. No academic dishonesty: coaching and structure OK; ghostwriting prohibited.
Data minimization, role-based access, and secure storage only.
1.9 Deliverables (write to disk or repo)

e2e/reports/<ASSIGNED_APP>/readiness_report_<ASSIGNED_APP>_v2_5_ceo_final.md

After completing your app’s work, print the Final Status Report JSON to stdout and serve it at GET /canary with the exact 9 fields from Section 1.1.
Example (replace values with live readings): { "app_name": "student_pilot", "app_base_url": "https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app", "version": "v2.5", "status": "ok", "p95_ms": 42, "commit_sha": "workspace", "server_time_utc": "2025-10-31T18:45:00Z", "revenue_role": "direct", "revenue_eta_hours": "2-6" }

SECTION 9 — CEO NOTES ON REVENUE AND PRIORITIES

Student Value = Business Value: keep the student journey frictionless and ethical.
Prioritize organic growth: auto_page_maker + scholarship_agent drive low-CAC traffic.
Ensure RBAC and OIDC are rock-solid: scholar_auth and scholarship_api are revenue enablers.
Stripe live mode switch is required before student_pilot can start revenue capture.
Maintain lean, autonomous operation: you own your app’s readiness and interop.
