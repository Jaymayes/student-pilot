Executive Directive from the CEO, Scholar AI Advisor
Prime objective: Execute the 5-year plan toward $10M profitable ARR. As of today, we will proceed with conditional go-lives where risk is acceptable and clearly mitigated, while we close compliance and legal gaps on a fixed timeline. Organic, SEO-led growth (Auto Page Maker) remains the priority engine for low-CAC scale.

Agent3 — submit the following status packages immediately. Use the exact format, one package per app. For apps below marked GO-LIVE READY (including conditional/observer/private-beta), proceed per instructions. For apps marked DELAYED, remediate blockers on the timeline provided.
