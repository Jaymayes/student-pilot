CEO DECISION: INTEGRATION READINESS AND ORDERS (War-Room, 2025-11-06 05:00 UTC)

Top-line

Staging: NO-GO until scholar_auth is hard-restarted and client registration verified.
Production: LOCKED. Do not lift until all global release gates are evidenced.
ARR ignition target (Nov 12) stands; earliest production ramp start remains Nov 9 contingent on gates.
Immediate unblock order (critical path)

scholar_auth: Execute Option A (manual cold restart) now.
SLA: 5 minutes to stop/start; 5 minutes to verify.
Post CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md with passing authorize flow for provider_register and student_pilot immediately after restart.
If restart fails in 5 minutes, execute Option C: deploy fresh staging IdP and rotate dependent app configs (30–60 minutes). Notify all DRIs of new IdP URL.
Updated timeline (UTC)

05:05–05:10: scholar_auth manual cold restart and smoke verify (authorize/consent renders; no invalid_client).
05:15: CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md posted; token issuance + refresh verified.
05:25: provider_register executes Order B; posts ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md.
05:45: scholarship_api executes Order 4; posts ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md; emits events.
05:46–05:47: auto_page_maker generates +2 pages off Order 4 events.
05:55: auto_page_maker posts evidence bundle.
16:00: Infra secrets delivery deadline for auto_com_center (Sentry DSN, AWS SQS+DLQ, Postmark, Twilio, DNS SPF/DKIM/DMARC, A2P filings). Auto-escalate if missed; run email-only fallback if Postmark available and A2P lags; SMS disabled.
21:00: auto_com_center staging validation evidence posted.
App-by-app orders and GO/NO-GO

scholar_auth | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: BLOCKED by stale process; fix is code-complete.
Orders:
Do manual cold restart now. Confirm process uptime resets; verify /oidc/authorize for provider_register and student_pilot renders consent (no invalid_client).
Ensure client metadata normalization (camelCase + snake_case) persists on boot and add startup self-check that fails fast if any client lookup mismatch is detected.
Deliver: CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md with registered clients, grant_types, redirect_uris, PKCE=S256, scopes; plus authorize URL proofs and id_token validation snippet.

Deliver ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md: endpoint inventory + Swagger link, token validation, RBAC, audit logs, P95 reads ≤120ms/writes ≤150ms, error <0.1%, ACID transaction proof, event emission to auto_page_maker and auto_com_center, request_id to Sentry trace links.
5. auto_page_maker | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GO AND ARMED.
Orders (triggered by scholarship_api Order 4):
Generate +2 pages within 60 seconds.
Deliver ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md: sitemap diff, IndexNow receipts, CWV p75 green, P95 proof, request_id traces, rollback guard confirmation (>5% regression triggers rollback).
6. auto_com_center

APP_BASE_URL (Staging): https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
APP_BASE_URL (Prod): https://auto-com-center.scholaraiadvisor.com
Status: Code complete; blocked on secrets/A2P; staging GO upon secrets; production LOCKED.
Orders:
Infra deliver secrets by 16:00 UTC; auto-escalate at 16:01 UTC if any missing.
If A2P pending, proceed email-only with Postmark; SMS disabled.

Observability: Prometheus snapshots, cross-app request_id, Sentry correlation.
Blockers log any gate failing; halt ramp until re-evidenced.
7. scholarship_sage | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: READY.
Orders:
Start 48-hour observe-only baseline upon rotated M2M secret distribution.
Deliver baseline_metrics_evidence.md at +48h: precision@5, coverage, matchReasons samples, fairness telemetry, SLO proofs, request_id traces.
8. scholarship_agent | APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Tracing: request_id propagates across all 8 apps; Sentry correlation with PII redaction.
Responsible AI: bias/fairness telemetry, transparent explanations, no academic dishonesty enablement.
Escalation and contingencies

If scholar_auth restart not verified by 05:10 UTC:
Execute new staging IdP deployment (Option C) immediately; rotate configs for provider_register, student_pilot, scholarship_api; re-run chain.
If any Infra secret missing at 16:00 UTC:
Auto-escalate to Infra leadership; proceed with email-only staging validation if Postmark present; do not attempt production comms or SMS until gates are evidenced.
Any gate failure at any step:
Halt ramp; fix-first; re-run evidence.
KPIs to report tonight

Staging chain lead time from auth-unblock to +2 pages generated.
P95 by app vs ≤120ms target; error rate; uptime.
Comms unsubscribe latency p95 under load; DLQ count.
SEO pages delta and IndexNow receipts count.
Evidence completeness rate (delivered vs committed).
ARR alignment

Maintain organic SEO flywheel as primary low-CAC engine (auto_page_maker).
Unlock comms (email-only if needed) to begin nurturing flows ahead of Nov 12 ARR ignition.
No paid acquisition until unit economics confirmed from organic funnel.
Final directive

Execute manual cold restart of scholar_auth now and post proof in 10 minutes. All downstream DRIs execute their SLAs upon unblock. Evidence-first culture: no assertions without artifacts. Keep me updated at each milestone with request_id-linked proofs.
