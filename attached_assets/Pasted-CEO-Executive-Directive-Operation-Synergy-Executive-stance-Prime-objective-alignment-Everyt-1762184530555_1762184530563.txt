CEO Executive Directive — Operation Synergy

Executive stance

Prime objective alignment: Everything below is to accelerate Full Operational Capability while protecting the $10M profitable ARR plan. Decisions favor low-CAC organic growth and reliability (SEO + SLOs) over net-new scope.
Current posture: Platform is largely GREEN with two pacing items. We will run FOC as a staged gate with evidence-based acceptance only.
Go / hold decisions

student_pilot E2E: GO now. Auth is GREEN. Execute smoke + 30-sample E2E immediately. SLA: 120 minutes to evidence bundle + SHA256.
provider_register E2E: CONDITIONAL GO. If AUTH_ISSUER_URL secret not fixed by T+15 min, escalate to CEO and proceed without provider E2E for this window.
auto_com_center 5× DRY-RUN: HOLD until Comms Infra resolves canary heap pressure (2-hour SLA). DRY-RUN must meet acceptance gates below.
scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent: FROZEN and GREEN. Maintain freeze; no breaking changes until FOC Go/No-Go.
Acceptance gates (binary)

Auth success rate ≥ 98% across student_pilot E2E (30 samples).
P95 latency ≤ 120 ms for top service calls (auth, scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, student_pilot UI flows).
Zero critical 5xx during test windows.
RBAC/tenant isolation: 0 cross-tenant leakage; 401/403 enforced on negative tests.
Error standards: JSON errors include request_id; consistent codes per spec.
auto_com_center DRY-RUN: ≥ 99% delivery success, zero DLQ growth, opt-out < 5 seconds; CAN-SPAM/GDPR/FERPA checks pass.
SEO DRY-RUN (non-FOC gating, but CAC-critical): auto_page_maker produces report on indexed pages, impressions/CTR, and conversion to student_pilot activation.
Immediate orders (who/what/when)

Frontend DRI (student_pilot): Execute E2E now. Deliver evidence bundle within 120 minutes. Include HAR, latency P50/P95/P99, WCAG/Lighthouse ≥ 90, RBAC negative tests, standardized error samples, screenshots, and SHA256 manifest.
Operator (provider_register): Update AUTH_ISSUER_URL secret to prod issuer and restart. Deadline: T+15 minutes from this notice. If missed, escalate to CEO and proceed with student_pilot-only run.
Comms Infra + auto_com_center DRI: Resolve canary heap pressure within 2 hours. On green, run 5× DRY-RUN with pre-staged artifacts and deliver the evidence bundle. Total SLA post-unblock: 2 hours to CEO PASS/FAIL.
Growth DRI (auto_page_maker SEO): Execute 24-hour DRY-RUN. Deliver page quality audit, sitemap/IndexNow validation, schema markup verification, and funnel test plan + GSC submission instructions if access is blocked. Report indexed pages, impressions/CTR, and activation conversion. Non-blocking for FOC, but critical for CAC.
Risk and compliance guardrails

Maintain API/schema freeze for scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent during test windows.
Enforce centralized auth (scholar_auth), HTTPS everywhere, standardized error contracts, and RBAC.
Compliance: CAN-SPAM/GDPR for comms; FERPA/COPPA for student data; evidence checklists must be signed off in each evidence bundle.
Lifecycle and revenue cessation outlook (Section 6 synthesis)
Dates are based on current tech pace and role type; plan refreshes annually with data.

Infrastructure (5–7 years typical)

scholar_auth: Obsolescence window Q2 2031–Q4 2032. Drivers: auth protocol evolution beyond OAuth2/OIDC, crypto agility (post-quantum), scaling/security standards. Contingencies: managed IdP migration could extend.
scholarship_api: Q1 2031–Q3 2032. Drivers: data model drift, volume/feature creep, multi-tenant analytics needs. Contingencies: modularization and read replicas extend life.
auto_com_center: Q4 2030–Q2 2032. Drivers: messaging vendor shifts, regulatory tightening, omnichannel orchestration complexity. Contingencies: message-bus decoupling and adapter pattern extend life.
User-facing (3–4 years typical)

student_pilot: Q4 2028–Q2 2029. Drivers: UX trends, accessibility standards, device patterns. Contingencies: design system and micro-frontend strategy extend.
provider_register: Q4 2028–Q2 2029. Drivers: provider UX expectations, workflow sophistication. Contingencies: component library refresh cycles extend.
Intelligence/automation (2–3 years typical)

scholarship_sage: Q2 2027–Q4 2028. Drivers: rapid LLM/model advances, retrieval strategies, explainability requirements. Contingencies: model-ops abstraction and evaluation harness extend.
scholarship_agent: Q2 2027–Q4 2028. Drivers: automation frameworks, data ingestion paradigms. Contingencies: plug-in architecture extends.
auto_page_maker: Q2 2027–Q4 2028. Drivers: SEO algorithm shifts, search UX changes (AI Overviews). Contingencies: multi-surface publishing (web + structured feeds) extends.
Revenue implications

Infra EOLs impact uptime/security; prioritize seamless migrations to prevent revenue leakage from auth/comm failures.
User-facing refresh cadence directly correlates with conversion; plan major UX refresh at ~36 months to safeguard B2C ARPU and activation.
Intelligence refresh cadence is critical to stay best-in-class on scholarship matching; budget for continuous model retraining/evaluation every 6–9 months with major re-baselines ~24 months.
Mandatory reporting (Section 7)
All DRIs (including Agent3) must submit a Section 7 report per assigned APP_BASE_URL using the exact template below. Do not include tasks from other applications. Due:

student_pilot and scholar_auth: with today’s E2E evidence.
provider_register: T+120 minutes after secret fix.
auto_com_center: T+120 minutes post-infra green + DRY-RUN.
scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker: confirm FROZEN state and attach lifecycle analysis.
Use this exact format:

KPIs to monitor for CEO review

B2C funnel: sessions → signups → activated users; ARPU from credit sales; free→paid conversion.
B2B funnel: new providers onboarded; time-to-first-listing; 3% fee yield; zero cross-tenant incidents.
CAC: organic share > 70%; SEO output (pages published, indexed, CTR); cost per activated student.
SLOs: uptime ≥ 99.9%; P95 ≤ 120 ms; zero critical 5xx in test windows.
Next checkpoints

T+0: student_pilot E2E starts now; evidence due T+120.
T+15: provider_register secret fix — if missed, escalate and proceed without it.
T+120 to T+240 (post-Comms Green): auto_com_center DRY-RUN evidence due with PASS/FAIL.
+24h: auto_page_maker SEO DRY-RUN report delivered.
I will issue FOC Go/No-Go only on receipt of all required evidence bundles meeting the acceptance gates. Keep execution velocity high, maintain the freeze discipline, and submit Section 7 reports precisely as specified.
