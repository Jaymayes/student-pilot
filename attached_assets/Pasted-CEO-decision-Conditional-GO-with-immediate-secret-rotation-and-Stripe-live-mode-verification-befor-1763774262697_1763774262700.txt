CEO decision: Conditional GO, with immediate secret rotation and Stripe live-mode verification before execution

Why this matters

The “first live dollar” validates the B2C credit engine and provides the baseline for our ARR ramp while staying aligned with our lean, organic-growth thesis and KPI model in the Playbook V2.0 (MAU via SEO, credit sales activation, and ARR targets) .
Multi-app orchestration across isolated Replit services requires tight coordination; success depends on correct secrets, live Stripe keys, and deterministic, JWT-verified service calls between apps .
Multiple NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET values appeared in chat. Treat them as compromised and rotate immediately per secure key lifecycle best practices (generate, store, rotate, retire) .
Immediate directives (T+0 to T+15)

Secret rotation (blocker removal)
Generate a new 32+ char base64url NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET offline.
Set the same value in:
auto_com_center
provider_register
Store in your Account Secrets (shared) and restart both apps.
Do not paste any secrets in chat or tickets. Consider prior values compromised; retire them now .
2. Stripe live-mode verification

provider_register: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY must be sk_live_… and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET from a LIVE endpoint.
student_pilot: STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY must be pk_live_…
Configure Stripe webhook: https://provider-register-…/stripe/webhook with events payment_intent.succeeded and payment_intent.payment_failed.
3. Base URL alignment and JWT/JWKS

provider_register: AUTO_COM_CENTER_BASE_URL, SCHOLAR_AUTH_BASE_URL, AUTH_JWKS_URL.
scholarship_api: AUTH_JWKS_URL and AUTH_ISSUER set to scholar_auth URLs.
student_pilot: SCHOLARSHIP_API_BASE_URL, AUTO_COM_CENTER_BASE_URL, SCHOLAR_AUTH_BASE_URL.
This inter-app discipline is required for isolated Replit services to function as a team .
Verification steps (T+15 to T+30)

auto_com_center smoke test:
POST /send-notification with header X-Webhook-Secret: <rotated value>;
Expect 200 with standardized JSON envelope.
Health checks:
/readyz on auto_com_center, provider_register, scholarship_api, student_pilot.
Execution (T+30 to T+45)

Live purchase in student_pilot: $9.99 Starter package
Confirm “Live mode” in Stripe Checkout.
Complete with a real card.
Expect redirect and visible credits (9,990).
Evidence and ledger (T+45 to T+60)

Stripe Dashboard screenshot: live charge succeeded.
student_pilot screenshot: updated credit balance.
scholarship_api JSON:
GET balance and transaction summary for the purchasing user (JWT-protected).
Optional: receipt email confirmation from auto_com_center (non-blocking).
Decision gates

GO if:
NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET rotated and present in both services.
Stripe keys in LIVE mode (pk_live_, sk_live_) and webhook signed with LIVE whsec_.
scholarship_api health green and ledger read/write OK.
NO-GO if:
Stripe still in test mode or webhook failing to reach provider_register.
scholarship_api ledger returns 5xx.
Roles and ownership (single-threaded, timeboxed)

Payments lead (provider_register): Stripe live keys + webhook; 15 minutes.
Comms lead (auto_com_center): secret rotation + smoke test; 10 minutes.
API lead (scholarship_api): JWKS/JWT verification + ledger path; 10 minutes.
Frontend lead (student_pilot): checkout flow + credit display; 10 minutes.
Coordinator: capture evidence and timestamps; 15 minutes.
KPIs to capture

Time-to-First-Dollar (purchase start → credits visible).
Webhook success rate (Stripe → provider_register; provider_register → auto_com_center).
P95 latency on notification and ledger endpoints (~120ms target; monitor but do not block) .
Evidence completeness (Stripe + credits + ledger).
Security and compliance guardrails

Secrets never in chat; rotate all values exposed in transcripts immediately; store in shared secrets vault (Account Secrets) with rotation schedule .
Ensure CORS only allows ecosystem origins; JWT verification on all non-public endpoints.
No PII in logs when handling payment webhooks and notifications (Playbook security posture expectations) .
Answer to your last note: “Is the NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET correct?”

Because multiple different values were posted in the thread, we will not validate any of them. Executive directive: rotate now to a fresh, unshared value; set identically in auto_com_center and provider_register; confirm by successful POST /send-notification smoke test. This aligns with our secure key management policy and prevents drift across services .
Strategic alignment

This validation directly supports our B2C credit monetization and KPI instrumentation, while we continue compounding low-CAC SEO growth and partner flywheel per the Playbook V2.0 roadmap to $10M ARR .
What I need from you to proceed now

Confirm: Stripe is in LIVE mode for provider_register and student_pilot.
Confirm: New NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET rotated and set in both apps (no value in chat).
Reply “GO” once both are done. I will start the 60-minute clock and hold the team to the timeboxes above.
