Executive Consolidation — CEO Decisions and Orders (Nov 11, 2025)

Prime directive alignment: Decisions below optimize for low-CAC, SEO-led growth, rapid but controlled ARR ignition, and SLO/security guardrails. All approvals remain subject to evidence SLAs and rollback protections.

Executive Summary

GO-LIVE READY (Frozen/Observer): scholarship_api, auto_page_maker, scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent
DELAYED (Conditional GO paths defined): auto_com_center, provider_register, scholar_auth, student_pilot
ARR ignition earliest windows (if gates pass): B2B 3% fees Nov 14–15; B2C credits Nov 13–15
Daily cross-app KPI rollups: 06:00 UTC via scholarship_sage; fairness rollups 12:00 UTC via scholarship_agent
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status Decision: DELAYED (Conditional GO)
CEO Orders

Gate A (Deliverability) decision window accepted: Nov 11, 20:00–20:15 UTC. Pass criteria affirmed: SPF aligned; DKIM aligned; DMARC p=quarantine; ≥80% inbox placement; complaints ≤0.1%; bounces ≤2%.
Evidence SLA: Submit full bundle within 15 minutes of test completion. Include screenshots, seed inbox outcomes, Postmark activity exports, and raw DNS record verifications.
Fallback mandate: If Gate A fails, immediately route all communications to in-app notifications; do not pause student_pilot onboarding. Provide fail report and new ETA for re-test (T+16–24 hours).
Risk controls: Prepare an alternate ESP contingency (SendGrid or SES) with pre-approved domain and DKIM keys if Postmark access/DKIM CNAMEs are still blocked after today’s escalation checkpoints.
DMARC p=reject: Approved for T+7 days post-PASS with 5-minute rollback plan. Provide daily DMARC aggregate report summaries until migration.
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status Decision: DELAYED (Gate C dependency)
CEO Orders

Manual MFA validation: Proceed today. Do not require CEO to conduct manual tests. Assign QA DRI to run the provided incognito OIDC + TOTP scenario and deliver:
3 screenshots (QR modal, success state, network panel with <120ms latencies); console log with zero errors; DB verification (mfaFactors, auditLogs).
Deadline: Today by 23:00 UTC. Evidence location + link back to the Executive Index.
Gate C performance verification: Nov 12, 20:00–20:15 UTC. PASS criteria: P95 ≤120ms on auth endpoints; error rate ≤0.1%; success rate ≥99.5%. Provide latency histograms (P50/P95/P99), request lineage samples, Prometheus export, and SLO annotations. 5-minute rollback plan must be active.
Security posture: Confirm PKCE S256, JWKS rotation checks, HSTS, and session-binding anti-replay evidence in the package.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status Decision: GO-LIVE READY (Frozen) — Approved
CEO Orders

Maintain freeze through Nov 12, 20:00 UTC. Auto-alert and hold page generation on CWV p75 regression or indexation <92%.
Daily 06:00 UTC SEO KPI export is approved. Ensure: XML sitemaps freshness, structured data validity (Organization/Breadcrumb/FAQ where used), robots.txt health, and 404/soft-404 monitoring. Add a weekly crawl budget snapshot.
Dependency note: Independent of Gates A/B/C. Keep CAC near zero and feed student_pilot/provider_register.
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status Decision: DELAYED (Waitlist; Conditional GO)
CEO Orders

Gate B (Stripe) E2E validation: Execute at Nov 11, 18:00 UTC; evidence due 18:15 UTC. PASS requires live key validation, webhook signature verification, 3% fee accrual event logging with deterministic formula, and refund webhook validation. Finance sign-off required in the report.
Waitlist enforcement: Keep ENABLE_WAITLIST_MODE=true until CEO issues FULL GO post-Gates B and C. No charges before authorization.
Auditability: The explicit fee calculation, charge IDs, and reconciliation trail are mandatory. Provide a sample end-to-end event lineage (checkout → charge → fee_accrued → refund).
Estimated Go-Live: No earlier than Nov 14. Earliest ARR: Nov 14–15.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status Decision: DELAYED (Conditional GO)
CEO Orders

Gate dependencies: Gate A (deliverability) and Gate C (auth P95). Adhere to in-app notification fallback on any deliverability failure. Do not block onboarding.
Activation telemetry: Confirm “first document upload” activation metric is flowing into 06:00 UTC rollups. Add funnel points: profile completion, first scholarship saved, first submission draft, first submission sent.
Accessibility/readiness: Ensure UI guided walkthroughs and accessibility checks (contrast, keyboard nav, ARIA labels). If mobile use-cases apply, present an offline-mode plan and feasibility by Nov 15, 20:00 UTC.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status Decision: GO-LIVE READY (Frozen) — Approved
CEO Orders

Maintain freeze through Nov 12, 20:00 UTC; DEF-005 migration window Nov 12, 20:00–Nov 13, 12:00 UTC with P95 protection and 5-minute rollback.
Integration readiness: OpenAPI is approved. Ensure client retries with jitter and 429/5xx backoff guidance documented for all consumers. Provide rate-limit headers and quota policy summary to DRI channels for student_pilot and provider_register.
Observability: Confirm 100% request_id lineage and SLO dashboards are visible to scholarship_sage ingestion.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status Decision: GO-LIVE READY (Observer/Frozen) — Approved
CEO Orders

Continue cross-app KPI rollups at 06:00 UTC. Ensure the following metrics are present daily:
B2C: sessions (organic), sign-ups, activation rate, conversion to paid, ARPU from credits
B2B: providers onboarded, live offers, total awards processed, accrued 3% platform fees
SLOs: uptime, P95, error rates by app; gate statuses and deadlines
Fairness integration spec: Approved. Begin telemetry ingestion and dashboard component post-freeze. Include parity heatmap, violation counts, and remediation evidence tracking. Provide SOC 2 mapping summary quarterly.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status Decision: GO-LIVE READY (Observer/Frozen) — Approved
CEO Orders

Holds remain in place: No autonomous sends until student_pilot GO and Gate A PASS. Continue 12:00 UTC fairness rollups.
Parity remediation sprint: Authorized for Nov 12–15 (post Gate C). Success criteria: reduce violations to ≤2 cohorts or provide justified mitigations with monitoring. Evidence due Nov 15, 20:00 UTC.
Responsible AI: Maintain ≥95% rationale coverage, document alert thresholds, and preserve full audit trails. No black-box workflows.
Security, Compliance, and Risk Controls (All Apps)

Nov 11, 23:00 UTC: scholar_auth manual MFA validation evidence due (QA).
Nov 12, 20:00–20:15 UTC: Gate C (Auth P95) test + evidence. If PASS, lift freezes per plan; trigger parity sprint for scholarship_agent; proceed toward student_pilot GO decision.
Nov 13, 16:00 UTC: CEO GO/NO-GO for student_pilot.
Nov 14–15: Earliest ARR ignition for B2B; B2C earliest Nov 13–15.
Reporting and Evidence Requirements

All evidence must include the application header (APPLICATION NAME + APP_BASE_URL) and be linked from the Executive Root Index.
Provide links to:
Gate A/B/C test artifacts (screenshots, logs, metrics)
OpenAPI docs (scholarship_api)
MFA manual test package (scholar_auth)
Daily KPI exports (scholarship_sage, auto_page_maker)
Parity remediation plan and final evidence (scholarship_agent)
Final CEO Notes

Strategy: Protect the SEO flywheel (auto_page_maker) and keep CAC near zero; enforce freezes and gates to de-risk ignition; maintain SLOs and Responsible AI guardrails.
Capital allocation: Priority remains on organic growth engines and reliability work that safeguards student value and trust.
Act with urgency: Hit the evidence SLAs and gate windows; use 5-minute rollbacks where applicable. We are on track to safely begin revenue capture this week if gates pass.
Acknowledge receipt and confirm owners for each deliverable. If any deadline risks exist, escalate immediately with a mitigation plan and revised ETA.
