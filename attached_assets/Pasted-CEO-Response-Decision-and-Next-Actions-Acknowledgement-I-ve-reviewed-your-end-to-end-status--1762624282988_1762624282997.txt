CEO Response — Decision and Next Actions

Acknowledgement

I’ve reviewed your end-to-end status, the staged communications, and the late-breaking finding that /.well-known/openid-configuration is being intercepted upstream of your Express app on Replit, causing the wrong issuer to be served and preventing code-level remediation. Your conclusion that Contingency A cannot resolve the root-path Discovery issue is accepted.
Executive Decisions

Guard the gate; quality bar stands
We will not weaken security or relax performance targets to force a launch. If Auth fails to meet the criteria, we slip. Non-negotiable.
2. 18:15 UTC decision stands; Contingency A superseded for root path

Proceed with the current schedule through 18:15 UTC. If Discovery is not GREEN, we will treat root-path /.well-known as an infrastructure defect outside our control and will not attempt risky workarounds tonight.
3. New plan authorized: Contingency B — Issuer and Discovery stabilization

Objective: Eliminate upstream interception risk and stabilize OIDC Discovery with deterministic latency.
Approach:
Adopt a canonical issuer on a dedicated subdomain: auth.scholaraiadvisor.com fronted by Cloudflare (or equivalent), with Workers/Routes handling:
/.well-known/openid-configuration (served correctly, with correct issuer)
/jwks.json
/authorize, /token proxied to origin
Origin can remain the current Replit app endpoints (e.g., /oidc/*) during migration. Clients only see auth.scholaraiadvisor.com as the issuer.
This change requires an issuer update across all relying parties. We will execute as a controlled, config-only change window with full conformance testing.
Rationale: Removes Replit edge interference, standardizes caching for Discovery/JWKS, and positions us for future scale without vendor-specific quirks.
4. Stripe gate remains hard for B2B

If Finance/Platform Ops cannot deliver the Stripe evidence package by 18:00 UTC, B2B stays blocked irrespective of auth outcomes. Escalate to CFO and Stripe Priority Support immediately if anything is at risk.
Schedule and Revised Milestones

Today
18:15 UTC: If Discovery not GREEN, do not pursue code hacks; declare infrastructure-blocked for root-path Discovery and trigger auto-slip posture toward the Nov 10 gate. Keep both pass/fail messages staged; do not broadcast unless triggered by the 20:00 outcome.
18:00 UTC: Stripe evidence package due. If missing, B2B is blocked until resolved.
20:00 UTC: If soak proceeds and fails, broadcast auto-slip; if we cancel soak due to Contingency B migration prep, broadcast the staged slip message with the new plan (see Messaging below).
Contingency B plan
By 19:30 UTC today: Open P1 support tickets with Replit (document upstream intercept), and begin Cloudflare provisioning (DNS, SSL/TLS, Workers, Routes) in parallel.
By 21:00 UTC today: Publish RFC-001 OIDC Issuer Migration with test plan and backout plan.
Nov 9, 17:00–19:00 UTC: Controlled change window:
Update relying parties to issuer: https://auth.scholaraiadvisor.com
Run OIDC conformance and end-to-end token exchange tests for student_pilot, provider_register, scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent.
Nov 9, 20:00–21:00 UTC: Pre-soak on new issuer (≥500 samples/endpoint, error ≤0.1%, P95 ≤120ms).
Nov 10, 00:00–00:15 UTC: Auth gate window.
ARR timing (updated if we slip tonight)
B2C (student_pilot): Gate Nov 10 00:00–00:15 UTC → ignition Nov 11 00:00 UTC.
B2B (provider_register): If Stripe evidence meets the 18:00 UTC hard deadline and Auth passes the Nov 10 gate, B2B ignition Nov 10 01:30–03:00 UTC; otherwise next green window after both gates are satisfied.
What I need now (evidence and escalations)

Auth DRI
18:15 UTC: Final GREEN/RED on Discovery. If RED, include proof that root /.well-known is intercepted (logs that never fire, timing diffs, curl traces), and confirm /oidc path stability. Mark Contingency A as insufficient for root path and shift to Contingency B.
21:00 UTC: RFC-001 OIDC Issuer Migration draft with:
Canonical issuer and Discovery document
JWKS strategy and cache headers (ETag + Cache-Control: public, max-age=300)
Relying party update steps, test matrix, and rollback
Performance SLOs and acceptance criteria
Finance/Platform Ops (Stripe)
Immediately: Status ping. If any risk, escalate to CFO and open Stripe Priority Support (budget up to $500).
18:00 UTC: Evidence package:
Dashboard settings screenshot/export
Webhook secret and event delivery logs
Server logs with verified signature and 200 OK in production mode
auto_com_center
Keep both messages staged. Add a third pre-approved variant for the “infrastructure intercept — issuer migration” narrative. Do not broadcast unless triggered by the outcome gate.
All other apps
Maintain change freeze. Prepare to consume new issuer via config-only change during the Nov 9 window.
Answer to your question

Yes. Document these findings for both the user and CEO.
Incident Documentation — Required contents and format

Title: OIDC Discovery Interception — Root-Path Infrastructure Incident
Applications affected: scholar_auth (primary), all relying parties (secondary)
APP_BASE_URL and Application Name at the top for each app section
Timeline (UTC): Detection → Diagnosis → Decision points
Impact: Incorrect issuer, latency >120ms P95, inability to remediate via code due to upstream interception
Root cause analysis: Evidence that Express handlers never execute on /.well-known, while /oidc/.well-known works; upstream edge interference identified
Decision log: 18:15 UTC gate honored; Contingency A insufficient; approve Contingency B (issuer migration)
Risk assessment: Security integrity preserved; schedule impact; ARR timing adjustments
Remediation plan (Contingency B): Domain, proxy, issuer, test plan, rollback
Acceptance criteria: All four auth endpoints P95 ≤120ms under load, error ≤0.1%, correct issuer end-to-end, conformance tests passing, JWKS/Discovery cache headers correct
Evidence appendix: Logs, curl traces, timing histograms, config diffs (with secrets redacted), Replit ticket IDs
Go/No-Go posture for today

Go only if Auth meets correctness and performance at 20:00 UTC soak. Otherwise, auto-slip. No exceptions.
Owner assignments

Auth DRI: Contingency B execution and RFC-001 by 21:00 UTC today
Platform Ops: Cloudflare/DNS setup, conformance test harness
Finance/CFO: Stripe escalation and evidence by 18:00 UTC
auto_com_center: Maintain staged comms; add issuer-migration variant
Close

You have executive approval to proceed with Contingency B if the 18:15 UTC check fails. Preserve security, preserve trust, and protect the gate. The short-term slip is acceptable to ensure long-term stability and ARR scalability.
