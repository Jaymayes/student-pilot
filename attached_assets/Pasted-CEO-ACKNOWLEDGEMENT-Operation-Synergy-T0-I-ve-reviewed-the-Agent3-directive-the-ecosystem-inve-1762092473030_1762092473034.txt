CEO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT — Operation Synergy T0

I’ve reviewed the Agent3 directive, the ecosystem inventory, and the status updates you provided. As CEO, I’m locking the plan, assigning owners, and setting the go/no‑go criteria tied to our 5‑year target of $10M profitable ARR. Execute as directed below. Maintain evidence discipline.

Executive decisions and priorities

B2C DRY‑RUN GO — Approved, contingent
Scope: Up to 20 pilot students; no live emails/SMS; DRY‑RUN enforced.
Preconditions to launch:
scholar_auth: Production login flow evidence (auth code → token exchange) captured via HAR. Owner: Auth DRI. SLA: 1 hour.
student_pilot: Env vars configured; E2E harness ready. Owner: Frontend DRI. SLA: 2 hours after auth GREEN.
auto_com_center: DRY‑RUN comms path verified with suppression list. Owner: Comms DRI. SLA: by T+6h.
Acceptance criteria during DRY‑RUN (initial 24h):
Registration → first valid recommendation conversion ≥60%
Registration → first application started within 7 days ≥25% (proxy intent during DRY‑RUN is acceptable)
Zero Sev1 incidents; unsubscribe flow functional; 0 live sends
2. B2B DRY‑RUN — On hold, conditional GO path

provider_register performance: Accepting the remediation update (P95 ~2 ms) as current truth. Good work.
Preconditions for B2B DRY‑RUN GO:
OIDC client registration in scholar_auth complete for provider_register (+offline_access). Owner: Auth DRI. SLA: 4 hours.
RBAC tenant isolation: 30‑sample evidence with real Provider role tokens (org‑scoped queries only). Owner: B2B DRI. SLA: by T+12h after auth GREEN.
3. scholarship_api performance plan — Closed, move to sustain

Latest benchmark P95 71 ms exceeds target. Owner: API DRI.
Sustain plan:
Maintain P95 ≤120 ms for 24 continuous hours (P50/P95/P99 + 5xx rate on dashboard).
Freeze index changes during DRY‑RUN; only emergency changes allowed.
4. scholarship_sage routing — Single‑source evidence required

Conflicting reports noted (404 vs no issue). Resolve with a definitive, timestamped evidence bundle:
/recommendations/{student_id}: 401 without auth; 200 with valid JWT+scope; include security headers and latency.
Owner: Sage DRI. SLA: by T+6h.
If any /api prefix issue persists on production, ship a temporary shadow endpoint (/recommendations at root) behind a feature flag. No user‑visible changes.
5. auto_page_maker — Greenlight SEO drills

Proceed with DRY‑RUN generation on 10 test scholarships post-API GREEN. Verify:
Trigger integrity from scholarship_api events
SEO metadata completeness (titles, descriptions, schema)
Public accessibility (staging) without indexing (noindex while DRY‑RUN)
Owner: SEO/Auto‑Gen DRI. SLA: T+12h for first 10 pages.
6. auto_com_center — DRY‑RUN validation

Deliver T+6h package:
End‑to‑end /api/send test, queue logging, suppression enforcement
Latency P50/P95/P99, error rate, message acceptance rate
Runbook for circuit breaker and retries
Owner: Comms DRI. SLA: T+6h.
Governance and evidence

Mandatory Section 7 reports (FOC readiness) due by T+24h for all apps. Received: scholar_auth, auto_com_center, scholarship_sage, scholarship_api. Still due: student_pilot, provider_register, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker.
Use the provided format exactly. Include:
Latency evidence (≥30 samples), security headers (6/6), standardized errors, CORS, RBAC tests
Lifecycle and revenue‑cessation estimate with rationale and contingencies
Interoperability and SLO enforcement

Centralized Auth: scholar_auth is the sole identity authority. JWKS validation on every service. No exceptions.
Source of Truth: scholarship_api for all core data. No service‑local truth.
Security: HTTPS/TLS only; HSTS; rate limiting on all public endpoints.
SLO targets: 99.9% uptime; ≤120 ms P95; standardized JSON errors; 0 critical auth misconfigurations.
Lifecycle and revenue‑cessation guidance (anchor dates for planning)

Infrastructure (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center): Plan for 5–7 year major refresh or replacement. Present your estimated date and triggers. Default planning window: Q4 2031–Q4 2033.
User‑facing (student_pilot, provider_register): 3–4 year UI/UX overhaul cadence. Defaults: Q2 2029–Q2 2030.
Intelligence/Automation (scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker): 2–3 year refresh cadence. Defaults: Q3 2027–Q3 2028.
Each DRI must set a specific quarter, tie it to risk triggers (security standards, framework shifts, UX norms), and note budget envelope for refresh.
KPI instrumentation for DRY‑RUN

B2C funnel: visits → reg → profile complete → first recommendation → application started → application submitted (proxy during DRY‑RUN).
CAC proxy: organic sessions driven by Auto Page Maker pages (no paid).
Provider funnel: provider signup → first scholarship listing → first applicant review action.
Platform revenue proxies during DRY‑RUN:
Credit purchase intent events (no charges)
Provider fee simulation against mock payouts
Risks and mitigations

Auth dependency: Mitigate by completing OIDC client registrations now; maintain a verified client registry with audits.
Routing/proxy variance (Replit): Maintain shadow endpoints where necessary; document; remove post‑fix.
Compliance: Ensure CAN‑SPAM/GDPR/COPPA/FERPA attestations are bundled. Legal sign‑off due by T+72h before any LIVE comms.
Immediate owner actions (next 6 hours)

Auth DRI: Register student_pilot and provider_register clients with offline_access; deliver a single HAR with successful authorization_code + refresh_token cycle; confirm CORS and cookie settings. SLA: 1 hour.
Frontend DRI (student_pilot): Set env vars; run E2E; collect 30-sample flow metrics; Lighthouse a11y ≥90. SLA: 2 hours post-auth GREEN.
Comms DRI (auto_com_center): Deliver DRY‑RUN results and queue health. SLA: T+6h.
Sage DRI: Produce definitive /recommendations evidence bundle. SLA: T+6h.
Decision log

B2C DRY‑RUN: Approved pending auth evidence; proceed immediately after GREEN.
B2B DRY‑RUN: Deferred until RBAC isolation proven with live tokens and OIDC client registration complete.
Performance improvement plans for scholarship_api and provider_register: Closed as of latest evidence; switch to sustain/monitor.
Final note to Agent3 instances

Identify your APP_BASE_URL, isolate your Section 4 tasks, comply with Section 5, perform Section 6 lifecycle analysis, and submit your Section 7 report by T+24h. Do not execute tasks outside your assigned application.
OPERATIONAL READINESS DECLARATION
FOC status by application will be set after Section 7 reports and T+24h sustained metrics. DRY‑RUN B2C is conditionally READY; B2B is NOT READY pending auth/RBAC.
