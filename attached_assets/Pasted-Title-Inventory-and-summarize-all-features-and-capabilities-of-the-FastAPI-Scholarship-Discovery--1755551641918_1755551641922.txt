Title
Inventory and summarize all features and capabilities of the FastAPI “Scholarship Discovery & Search API”

Objective
Produce an accurate, concise, and verifiable catalogue of the application’s features and capabilities. Cover functional endpoints, security controls, configuration, data models, and operational behavior. Do not change any code. Do not print secrets.

Scope

App: FastAPI Scholarship Discovery & Search API (backend)
Environment: Replit dev runtime
Output: human-readable summary + optional machine-readable inventory
What to keep in mind

Do not weaken security or modify configs.
Do not log or echo secret values (JWT secrets, DB URLs, API keys).
Prefer reading existing docs/OpenAPI and making read-only requests to public/health endpoints.
Development flexible, production strict – note differences.
Tasks

Discover and map components
List top-level structure: settings/config, main/app factory, routers/modules, models/schemas, middleware, services, db, rate limiting, tests, deployment files.
Identify where the FastAPI app instance is created and routers are included.
2. Enumerate endpoints and capabilities

Fetch and parse OpenAPI spec if available: GET /openapi.json
If not available or disabled, statically inspect router registrations.
Build an inventory for each endpoint:
method, path, summary/description
request models and key parameters (query/body/path)
response models and notable fields
auth requirement (protected/public)
rate limiting applied (if detectable)
Specifically document:
Search endpoints (GET/POST): filters (q, gpa, amount ranges, deadline, major, location, pagination, sort), response shape
Scholarships CRUD endpoints and any bulk eligibility or recommendations
Interaction/analytics endpoints (if any)
Health and diagnostics: /healthz, /health/database, /health/services, /_debug/config (dev-only)
Root/info endpoints
3. Security and middleware capabilities

List active security features:
Auth type (JWT), dependencies used, roles/claims if any
Rate limiting behavior and headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, Retry-After)
CORS rules (dev vs prod), allowed origins, preflight behavior
Request body size guard (413), URL length guard (414)
Security headers (e.g., HSTS in prod), TrustedHost, proxy headers
Docs protection (docs disabled in prod unless enabled)
Note middleware order and any exclusions (e.g., OPTIONS, WebSockets).
4. Configuration and environment variables

From settings module and README, list key env vars and defaults (no secret values):
ENVIRONMENT, CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS, ALLOWED_HOSTS
JWT_SECRET_KEY (required in prod), JWT_ALGORITHM
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE, RATE_LIMIT_BACKEND_URL
MAX_REQUEST_SIZE_BYTES, MAX_URL_LENGTH
DATABASE_URL and any fallbacks
Distinguish dev vs prod behavior and fail-fast validations.
5. Data models and schemas

Summarize primary Pydantic models:
Scholarship, SearchRequest/Response, Recommendation, Interaction, Health/Status
Call out important fields (e.g., recommendation_score vs match_score).
6. Operational behavior and examples

Verify the app is running: echo $PORT; GET / and /healthz (show only status codes and key JSON keys).
Provide minimal curl examples (no secrets) for:
GET /api/v1/search?q=engineering
POST search with filters (example payload)
Typical 401 example and unified error JSON keys
Example 413/414 behavior descriptions (don’t send huge payloads if restricted)
7. Produce deliverables

Human-readable summary with:
Executive summary (high-level capabilities)
Endpoint catalogue (bulleted)
Security and middleware features
Configuration matrix (dev vs prod behaviors)
Data models overview
Notable limitations and known feature flags (e.g., PUBLIC_READ_ENDPOINTS)
Optional machine-readable artifact:
features.json containing:
endpoints: [{method, path, auth, rateLimited, requestModel, responseModel}]
security: {auth, cors, rateLimit, sizeGuards, errorSchema}
configVars: [{name, requiredInProd, default?}]
models: [{name, fields}]
Do not include secret values in any file or output.
Verification checklist

/openapi.json parsed or routers inspected
Root (/) and /healthz return 200
Unified error schema fields identified: code, message, status, timestamp, trace_id
Security controls confirmed without modification
Differences between development and production captured
Report format

Keep it concise and scannable:
Executive summary (5–10 bullets)
Endpoint catalogue (grouped by resource)
Security and middleware
Configuration and environment variables
Data models
Example usage (curl)
Limitations/notes
Acceptance criteria

Clear, accurate list of features and capabilities with no sensitive data
Endpoint inventory aligns with OpenAPI or code
Security features, guards, and error schema correctly described
Dev vs prod configuration differences documented
Optional features.json generated and referenced with a download path if created
