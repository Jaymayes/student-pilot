Acknowledged. Strong response to the cost spike and clean execution on the payout cap raise.

Executive approvals and directives

Cost governance
Approval: Keep COST_THROTTLE=ACTIVE until rolling 24h projection remains ≤ $280 for 3 consecutive hours.
Step‑down plan once ≤ $280 for 3h:
Re-enable background tasks to 75% for 1h → 100% if projection stays ≤ $300.
Maintain 60s TTL cache on search/match through T+24h; revisit TTL at T+24h.
Watch items: queue_depth for /documents/analyze must stay < 30 and P95 ≤ 1.5s. If either breached for 15m, add one worker (no change to throttle).
2. Payout cap raise

Accepted. CFO-20260114-PAYOUT-RAISE-250 consumption is approved and logged.
Guardrails remain: global cap $5,000/day; 10% rolling holdback; auto‑pause provider >1% refund/dispute; manual review within 4 hours.
3. Performance workstream (Directive 3)

Target remains: ≥20% P95 reduction for each of the top 5 endpoints by T+48h.
Add:
Pre-compute and cache match candidates (Bloom/bitmap or materialized view) refreshed every 5 minutes.
Return streaming responses for analyze/apply with early headers < 300ms.
Deliverables at T+24h: before/after profiles and regression guard (no accuracy drop on match quality).
4. T+24h “Mission Accomplished” packet (required to consider paid pilot)

Include: SLO rollup, error histograms, revenue split (B2C credits, B2B fees), ARPU, refund rate, AI gross margin, SEO net pages + CTR, LTV:CAC, cost vs cap, payout utilization/holds, security/privacy samples, incident log.
If fully green, you are pre‑authorized to consume CEO-20260114-PAID-PILOT-72H under these enforced conditions:
Daily budget ≤ $150 with rolling‑24h spend
CAC ceiling $12 with 24h continuous‑breach auto‑pause
ARPU ≥ $18 within 7 days (≥1.5× CAC) or auto‑pause
Retargeting only; no prospecting; privacy/compliance green
5. Finance ops

Confirm reserve ledger for 10% holdback and net‑14 payout schedule (simulation now, LIVE post T+24h if green).
Reconciliation check at T+24h: Stripe charges/refunds/payout accruals = platform ledger ±$0.
6. Communications

No external marketing. Internal note to Support only: cutover complete, performance stable, payouts guarded; advise providers that payout caps are temporarily raised to $250 with reserves.
Next deliverables

T+12h hypercare: full packet + paid pilot eligibility check.
If any Sev‑1, P95 > 110ms for 30+ min, Stripe success < 98.5% for 30+ min, or fraud ≥ 0.5%: immediate rollback to protective posture and page CEO.
Stay the course. Organic SEO + disciplined unit economics are our path to $10M ARR.
