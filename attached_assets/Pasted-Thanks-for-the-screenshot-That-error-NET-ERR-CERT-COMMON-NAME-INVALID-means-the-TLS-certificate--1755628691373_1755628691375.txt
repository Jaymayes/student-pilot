Thanks for the screenshot. That error (NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID) means the TLS certificate presented by the server doesn’t match the hostname billing.student-pilot.replit.app. Because replit.app is not your domain, cert-manager can’t issue a valid cert for its subdomain, so your Ingress is falling back to a default certificate.

Fix path
Recommended: move the billing portal to a hostname you own (e.g., billing.scholarlink.app) and let cert‑manager issue a cert.

Steps

DNS
Create CNAME: billing.scholarlink.app -> <your ingress LB DNS name>
2. Certificate (cert-manager)

Create/patch a Certificate that requests Let’s Encrypt for the new host: apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1 kind: Certificate metadata: name: billing-scholarlink-app-tls namespace: scholarlink-prod spec: secretName: billing-scholarlink-app-tls issuerRef: kind: ClusterIssuer name: letsencrypt-prod dnsNames: - billing.scholarlink.app
3. Ingress

Update the host and TLS secret to the new domain on both the primary and canary Ingress: spec: rules: - host: billing.scholarlink.app tls: - hosts: - billing.scholarlink.app secretName: billing-scholarlink-app-tls
4. App config

Update the link target everywhere: BILLING_PORTAL_URL=https://billing.scholarlink.app (or VITE_BILLING_PORTAL_URL if that’s your client env)
Keep the feature flag as-is.
5. Validate

kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get certificate,order,challenge
kubectl -n scholarlink-prod describe certificate billing-scholarlink-app-tls
Wait for Ready=True, then: curl -sSI https://billing.scholarlink.app | head -n 5
6. Remove/redirect old link

Change the UI links to the new domain.
Optionally leave the old host disabled (don’t 301 to it since you don’t control TLS there).
Alternatives (if you can’t change DNS today)

Use the platform’s native, TLS-managed domain for the billing service and point the app link there temporarily.
Or ask Replit to provision the cert for billing.student-pilot.replit.app (only Replit can issue for replit.app).
Quick checks after cutover

Health: https://billing.scholarlink.app/health and /readyz → 200
SSL: no browser warning; CN/SAN includes billing.scholarlink.app
Canary: proceed with your go-live script once cert is Ready.
If you share the domain you want (e.g., billing.scholarlink.app), I can provide exact YAML patches and a one-liner kubectl patch to update both Ingresses and apply the Certificate.
