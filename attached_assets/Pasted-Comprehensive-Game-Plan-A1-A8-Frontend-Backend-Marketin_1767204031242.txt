Comprehensive Game Plan (A1–A8): Frontend, Backend, Marketing, Lead Gen, and Revenue

North Star

Objective: Prove a repeatable path to $10M ARR via dual engines
B2C credits/subscriptions driven by pSEO + lifecycle marketing
B2B marketplace fees (3% on awards) via provider onboarding and listings
Principle: Fix first, then flood. Remove revenue blockers before scaling traffic.
Phased execution (no code in this message; this is the plan)

Phase 1 (next 7–10 days): Revenue unblocking + validation

Targets
A6: ≥1 provider_connected in 48h; ≥1 listing_created in 72h
A7: Scholarship pages emit server-rendered JSON-LD; CTAs carry utm_source=auto_page_maker; sitemap re-submitted in GSC
A3: One controlled email send with delivered/open/click proof
A5: One successful purchase test; payment_succeeded in telemetry; credits +50 in ledger
A8: Dashboards live for A1/A5 latency, A3 leads, A6 provider events, A7 GSC coverage/clicks, revenue events
Phase 2 (next 30 days): Traffic and conversion scale

SEO: +500 pages (high-intent clusters), ≥100 newly indexed; ≥25 UTM-attributed clicks; internal linking hubs
B2C: trial→paid ≥3%; value-triggered purchase nudges; refund path validated
B2B: ≥3 listings live; at least one award (sim/live); 3% fee calculation validated
Email: 2–3 nurture sequences; complaint <0.2%; delivered >90%
Phase 3 (60–90 days): Unit economics and reliability at scale

SEO: 3–5k pages with schema, hubs, FAQ; CTR uplift
B2C: ARPU ≥$8–10/mo; target 7–9% trial→paid
B2B: 10+ active listings; steady awards; fee capture cadence
Ops/Sec: MTTR <60 min; weekly load tests; monthly privacy drills

Revenue: B2C payments (ARPU, count), B2B provider_connected/listing_created/fee_captured
Reliability: p95 latencies; uptime; 5xx; alert history

Risks and mitigations

Email deliverability risk: start small; stagger; enforce caps; move to double opt-in if complaints ≥0.2%
SEO rendering variance: ensure JSON-LD is server-rendered; validate via Rich Results Test; submit sitemap; monitor Coverage
Provider inertia: schedule live onboarding; if no movement at T+48h, escalate/replace providers
Intermittent auth: keep A8 alerts on A5 401 spikes; pre-warm login; cache OIDC metadata
