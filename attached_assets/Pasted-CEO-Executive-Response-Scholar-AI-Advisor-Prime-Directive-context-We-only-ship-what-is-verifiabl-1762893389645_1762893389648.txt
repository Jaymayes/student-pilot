CEO Executive Response — Scholar AI Advisor
Prime Directive context: We only ship what is verifiably ready, protects the student funnel, and accelerates low-CAC ARR. Evidence must be centralized, accessible, and audit-ready.

Immediate findings

Evidence accessibility: Several artifacts you reference appear as local file paths and cannot be verified in the CEO evidence store. Local workspace paths are not acceptable as “live links.” Evidence must be accessible to the executive review location with working URLs and checksums. API assets should be treated as products with first-class documentation and discoverability, not scattered references .
Scope: You must act only on your assigned application(s). Cross-app coordination is encouraged, but each DRI remains accountable for their app’s Gate evidence and Section V report.
Mandatory actions for Agent3 (due now)

Confirm your assigned app(s)
Reply with the list of applications you directly own. If you own scholar_auth Gate C (as implied), state it explicitly.

Publish an accessible manifest for your app(s)

Title: CEO_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST_<APP>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
Location: Shared CEO evidence store (not a local workspace path). Include per-file: title, purpose, timestamp, SHA-256, and a live link. APIs must have an OpenAPI/Swagger link and changelog; APIs are products, and discoverability is non-negotiable .
Include a Monitoring & Rollback section: SLO dashboard link, alert policies, 5-minute rollback playbook. Ensure production vs. workspace separation is explicit per deployment best practices .
3. Deliver Section V status report(s) in the required format
Place this at the top of every report:
APPLICATION NAME: <Your App>
APP_BASE_URL: <URL>
Then include:

Status: GO-LIVE READY or DELAYED
Evidence links: Functional, security, performance, UAT, and integration testing. Include who executed tests and when. Use the testing hierarchy: unit, integration, system, and UAT, with clear pass/fail and defect triage outputs .
Security & compliance: MFA/PKCE, RBAC, token/session management, TLS/HSTS, encryption at rest, audit logging. HOTL controls and explainability are required for Responsible AI; no “black box” systems. Provide logs demonstrating decision traceability and human override controls .
Reliability & DR: Target ≥99.9% uptime, P95 latency targets, disaster recovery plan, backup cadence, and runbook links. Show production monitoring and alerting set up per deployment guidance .
Integration: End-to-end proofs across auth → app → API → events, with request_id lineage. Include OpenAPI docs and versioning; “API-as-a-product” standards apply .
Deployment: Blue/green or phased rollouts, rollback procedure, and separation of dev vs. prod via .replit/workflows or equivalent; MTTR playbook aligned to monitoring .
Student value & growth alignment: Show how the app measurably advances First Document Upload activation and the SEO-led flywheel; cite KPIs and dashboards that feed scholarship_sage. This is core to the Playbook and our ARR plan .
Provisional gate calls and directives
These are contingent on verifiable evidence in the shared store.

auto_page_maker Provisional decision: GO-LIVE READY (Frozen) through unfreeze window, conditional on:
Baseline evidence: CWV p75 (LCP, FID, CLS), indexed pages, and daily SEO rollups feeding scholarship_sage;
Automated paging spec + 5-minute rollback SLA;
Alert thresholds for CWV/indexation regressions. Freeze protects our zero-CAC acquisition engine and is aligned to the Playbook’s SEO growth model and activation-first strategy .
provider_register — Gate B
Decision: NO-GO until evidence package is accessible and verified. Evidence must include: webhook signature verification, deterministic 3% platform fee events with request_id lineage, refund scenarios, and Finance sign-off. Publish to the CEO store with live links.

scholar_auth — Gate C (hard gate)
Decision: NO-GO until Gate C evidence passes and is accessible. Acceptance criteria:

Security: MFA/PKCE, JWKS, HSTS, RBAC, encrypted storage, and complete audit trails; provide explainability notes for any adaptive controls and HOTL overrides .
Performance: P95 ≤120ms, success ≥99.5%, error ≤0.1% during a 30-minute soak.
Reliability: DR plan and tested rollback. Production monitoring and alerting linked per deployment guidance .
scholarship_sage Observer mode GO contingent on accessible daily 06:00 UTC rollups, fairness telemetry plan, and immutable audit trail links. Responsible AI and fairness monitoring are explicit requirements for analytics that inform decisions at scale .
Risk controls and Responsible AI guardrails

Human-on-the-loop (HOTL) must be demonstrable for high-risk actions with approval gates, override mechanisms, and notifications; all autonomous decisions must be explainable and auditable to maintain trust and compliance .
Continuous fairness monitoring and periodic audits are required where models influence user outcomes; integrate user redress mechanisms in app UIs and admin consoles .
ARR ignition dependencies

B2C credits: Requires Gate C pass and student_pilot GO with age gate, DSAR endpoints, and Privacy/ToS sign-off. These are non-negotiable before monetization.
B2B 3% fees: Requires Gate B pass, Gate C pass, and Finance sign-off. Tie every milestone to activation metrics and organic acquisition performance per the Playbook’s path to $10M ARR .
Your next steps (concise)

Within 60 minutes:
Confirm your assigned app(s).
Publish the accessible CEO evidence manifest(s) for your app(s) with live links and checksums.
Submit the Section V report(s) with GO-LIVE READY or DELAYED, blockers, and exact go-live date/time if delayed.
I will issue GO/NO-GO immediately upon verification of accessible evidence. Maintain freeze discipline where ordered, protect the student funnel, and keep the SEO flywheel green.
