Acknowledged. Production freeze remains in force until the Hour 72 Unfreeze Review. Thank you for the tight coordination. Here’s the executive checklist, interim gates, and the go/no-go matrix to land this cleanly and resume the Growth Sprint without slippage.

Interim checkpoints and artifacts

T+24 (end of Day 1)
eval ban: Repo- and build-level search = 0 matches; CI rule active (screenshot/log).
Secret hygiene: Secret scans (repo + dist) = 0 positives; rotation log completed; CDN cache purge confirmed.
Access control: /api/billing/balance requires auth+authorization; contract tests attached.
SSR stability: Public listing returns 200/404; SSR integration tests green.
T+36
Dashboards live: Security & Reliability board with auth abuse metrics, reconciliation deltas, endpoint contract health, SSR error rate, p95 latency, error budget burn. Share read-only links.
T+48 (end of Day 2)
SQLi hardening: All suspect queries converted to parameterized/ORM; negative injection tests passing; SAST clean.
Error handling: try/catch + rollback + transient retry in billing/storage validated via fault-injection tests; error taxonomy events visible.
CORS: Allowlisted origins and preflight verified; doc included.
Hour ~68 verification (QA/Sec)

Rerun qa-comprehensive-execution-report.json; post the full report plus a short summary of deltas (issues closed, tests added, remaining Medium/Low with owners and dates).
Canary validation checklist prepped and shared 2 hours before Unfreeze Review.
Hour 72 Unfreeze Review (agenda and required evidence)

QA/Sec: Present verification results, RT test status, and secret-scan outputs (repo + dist). Confirm 0 Critical/High open and that all new CI gates are active.
Backend: Demonstrate fixes for access control, parameterized queries, error handling, SSR; show logs with PII redaction in place.
DevOps: SLO adherence during canary in staging; dashboards live; rollback guardrails; Redis-backed rate limiting configured and observed.
Billing/Finance: Reconciliation job output (24h) with $0 deltas; idempotency adherence; sample test-mode charge flow.
Product: Confirm no material UX regressions; rate-limiting FP rate <0.5% with override path documented.
Go/no-go decision matrix

Must-pass (no exceptions):
0 Critical and 0 High open; secret scanners clean (repo + built assets).
Access control correct for protected endpoints; public endpoints return expected codes.
SQL injection tests blocked; SAST clean on SQL patterns.
SLOs stable (99.9% uptime target; p95 latency within baseline ±15% during canary).
Conditional (requires CEO approval if marginal):
Rate-limiting false positives 0.5–1.0% with documented mitigation and 24h plan to reduce.
Non-blocking Medium items with owners, ETA ≤10 days, and CI coverage to prevent regressions.
Automatic no-go:
Any secret finding unresolved; any auth bypass; reconciliation deltas >$0; or p95/5xx breach beyond guardrails without immediate explanation and rollback.
Post-unfreeze rollout plan

Gradual traffic ramp: 10% for 2 hours → 50% for next 4 hours → 100% if all guardrails green.
Live war room for first 8 hours; on-call assignments confirmed; rollback and feature flags pre-wired.
Monitoring thresholds:
p95 latency +15% or 5xx +0.5% vs baseline triggers automatic rollback.
Any PII redaction violation triggers freeze and root-cause before reattempt.
Parallel work allowed during freeze (no prod code deploys)

SEO/Auto Page Maker: Content generation, structured data, sitemap/index coverage prep.
Provider acquisition: Outreach, LOIs, and onboarding collateral; sandbox demos only.
Experiments: Finalize pricing/onboarding A/B designs and entitlement logic behind flags.
Data: Wire ./qa-analysis-report.json, ./qa-runtime-validation-report.json, and the new qa-comprehensive-execution-report.json into the Security & Reliability dashboards.
Additional executive requests

Residual risk brief: QA/Sec to list top 3 residual risks post-remediation, with mitigation and monitoring plans.
Medium/Low remediation plan: Owners + ETAs (≤10 days for Medium; ≤30 days for Low) added to the next sprint backlog.
Compliance log: Capture all security-relevant changes (cookies, rate limiting, logging redaction, billing precision) in our compliance changelog.
Cadence

Stand-up daily at 9:00 AM for blockers; EOD 6:00 PM status to exec channel tracking progress vs T+24/T+48/T+72 gates.
I will chair the Hour 72 Unfreeze Review. If any must-pass criteria are at risk, escalate by EOD prior—do not defer to the meeting.
Stay focused on closure quality, not just speed. We’ll lift the freeze the moment the evidence meets the bar and then immediately resume the Growth Sprint deployments.
