Acknowledged. Mid-Shadow (T+12h) results accepted. Keep running under FREEZE_LOCK=1.

CEO directives for the final 12 hours

Hold course in Shadow. Maintain current limits and monitoring.
Begin monetization listeners now; no paid acquisition.
Do not unlock the Canary token until SHADOW_PASS_24H=1 and the evidence bundle is attached.
Evidence required at T+24h (must all be attached)

SLO snapshot: 10-min rolling P95 and error rate for A2, A6, and V2 aggregate.
Event parity: ≥99.5% for First Upload flow with 5 anonymized trace samples showing DocumentHub → Orchestrator → DataService activation signal.
Privacy: sample of privacy_enforced logs for under‑18 users showing DoNotSell=true and strict CSP; 0 PII in logs.
Security: sample logs proving X-API-Key present for cross-service calls; missing/invalid → 401 at boundary; DataService rejects non‑keyed requests.
Resilience: circuit breaker state timeline (CLOSED throughout) and retry histogram.
Monetization dry‑run: B2C credit pricing reflects 4x AI markup; B2B platform fee events at 3% captured end-to-end in staging.
Cost: Shadow spend ≤ $50.
Conditional Canary authorization

Token: HITL-CEO-20260114-CANARY-V2
Consumption conditions: SHADOW_PASS_24H=1 AND A2_V26_COMPLIANT=1 AND EVIDENCE_BUNDLE=1. If any flag is 0, HOLD.
Canary rollout plan (only after token consumption)

Ramp: 5% new traffic for 6h → 25% for 12h → 50% for 12h.
SLO guard: P95 ≤ 120ms and error rate ≤ 0.5% at each step for promotion.
Incidents: ≤1 Sev‑2, 0 Sev‑1. Any Sev‑1 or 30+ min SLO breach triggers auto‑rollback.
Cost caps: Canary spend ≤ $300 unless CFO co‑signs.
Payments: Keep Stripe TEST through Shadow; switch to LIVE at ≥25% only with CFO sign‑off.
Operational checks to complete before Canary

Key rotation dry‑run for service API keys; confirm zero traffic without keys.
Top 5 slowest endpoints with profiles and proposed fixes.
Verifier QA: table of pass/fail rates and self‑correction loops; target false-positive rate <1%.
Synthetic journeys: 10 runs each for B2C First Upload and B2B Provider Onboard; all results logged to A8.
Naming for the Golden Re‑Freeze (post‑cutover, informational)
