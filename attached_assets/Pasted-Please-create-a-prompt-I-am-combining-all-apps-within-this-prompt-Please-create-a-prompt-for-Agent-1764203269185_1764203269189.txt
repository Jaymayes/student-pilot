Instruct the agent to only use the part of the prompt that relates to their app. Have the app ID itself before starting the work so there is no confusion. The goal is to get the apps 100% ready and working together today. If today is not possible, provide an estimated time when the app will be ready to stop generating revenue and which third-party systems need to be in place.

STATUS: MASTER PROMPT v2 COMPLIANT ✅

Unified Multi‑App Execution Prompt (Read‑Only Except Your Section)

GLOBAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL APPS (READ-ONLY FOR AGENT3)

Only act on the section labeled for your APP_ID. All other sections are reference only.
Before doing any work, identify yourself by outputting the exact header: APP_ID: <your_app_id> | APP_BASE_URL: <your_base_url>
All reports you generate must begin with that same header line.
Objective: get the full 8‑app ecosystem production‑ready and working together today. If any blocker prevents same‑day readiness, report an ETA to start generating revenue and list the third‑party systems that must be in place.
SLOs to enforce: 99.9% uptime; ~120ms P95 latency; secure by default; no PII leakage; Responsible AI and compliance (FERPA/COPPA/CAN‑SPAM, TCPA where applicable).
Output style: concise status, explicit checklists with PASS/FAIL and evidence, concrete actions with owners and timestamps, decisioned Go/No‑Go at the end.
SECTION: auto_com_center (AGENT3) — ACTIONABLE
You are Agent3. This is your only actionable section. All other sections are reference only.

Identify yourself now
Print exactly: APP_ID: auto_com_center | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
If your runtime does not match this APP_ID, stop and output MISMATCH.
2. Mission and scope

Mission: operate the centralized communications and campaign orchestration layer for the Scholar AI Advisor ecosystem across email (and optionally SMS/push later), ensuring consented, reliable, low‑CAC growth communications that drive scholarship discovery and completions.
Guardrails: zero tolerance for PII leakage, strict consent and unsubscribe handling, frequency caps, channel failovers, and attribution to organic SEO (Auto Page Maker) vs. paid.
3. Production readiness verification (must run and report)

Health/readiness:
Verify GET /healthz returns healthy and GET /readyz returns ok; include response codes and timings.
Confirm heap usage < 70% and GC P95 < 10ms; include current values.
Auth and security:
Validate scholar_auth JWT verification using current JWKS; show a signed test call result.
Confirm PII redaction in logs with a synthetic message containing email, phone, name.
Rate limits/backoff:
Assert global rate limit (e.g., 60 rpm/IPv6) is enforced; show a 61st request returns 429.
Confirm exponential backoff policy when provider returns 5xx; include retry jitter settings.
Logging/metrics:
Ensure structured JSON logs include traceId, userId (hashed), campaignId, channel, deliverability.
Verify metrics export includes: sends, deliveries, opens, clicks, bounces, complaints, unsubscribes, latency P50/P95, provider status.
Data integrity:
Validate message schema (idempotency key, recipient hash, consent scope, templateId, locale).
Show a sample of 3 stored message records with required fields present.
User‑facing responses:
Confirm no stack traces in API responses; test an induced 400/401/429/500.
Consent and compliance:
Check that unsubscribe link is injected for email and that one‑click unsubscribe updates suppression.
Verify CAN‑SPAM footer tokens (physical address, support email) render correctly.
Deliver a status table with PASS/FAIL and evidence snippets.
4. Third‑party provider configuration (must validate)

Email: Postmark (LIVE)
Verify Server Token present, Message Stream configured (e.g., broadcast/transactional), DKIM/SPF aligned, bounce/complaint webhooks to POST /webhooks/postmark with signature validation.
Show current deliverability: deliveries/sends, complaint rate, bounce rate. Targets: deliverability ≥ 98%, complaint ≤ 0.1%.
SMS (if enabled now or for ETA): Twilio
If not configured today, mark DEFERRED and list required: Account SID, Auth Token, Messaging Service SID, US A2P registration status, STOP/HELP handling, webhook to POST /webhooks/twilio, signature validation.
Push (if planned): Web Push (VAPID) or OneSignal
If not configured, mark DEFERRED and list required keys.
Error monitoring (optional but recommended): Sentry DSN; if absent, mark OPTIONAL.
5. Inter‑service integrations (prove connectivity with timings)

scholar_auth → validate token introspection/JWKS fetch; record latency.
scholarship_api → read scholarship metadata to personalize subject lines; record latency.
scholarship_agent → accept campaign intents and return outcomes; record latency. If degraded, enable retries and queueing; confirm dead‑letter queue policy.
scholarship_sage → embed advisor‑generated snippets in messages; record latency.
student_pilot → send journey‑step notifications (application started/missing docs/deadline reminders).
provider_register → provider onboarding confirmations and fee disclosures; verify dynamic merge fields.
auto_page_maker → capture UTM and pass attribution; confirm campaign links append utm_source=auto_page_maker.
Produce an inter‑service connectivity table (status, P95 ms, last error).
6. Consent, frequency capping, and safety rails (must enforce)

Consent store: confirm per‑channel, per‑purpose scopes with timestamps and provenance.
Frequency caps: default max 2 emails/week/user and 1/day; demonstrate cap enforcement with a simulated batch.
Quiet hours: default do not send 9pm–8am local recipient time unless transactional.
Blocklists: global suppression and provider‑level suppression merged; show a sample resolution.
Regional compliance: enable COPPA guardrails for under‑13; block promotional sends.
7. Campaign go‑live checklist (execute a canary and report)

Create campaign “Welcome + First Scholarship Fit” to 1% canary cohort with:
Subject line A/B, template vCurrent, Postmark message stream, UTM parameters.
Personalization: user first name, 1–3 scholarship titles from scholarship_api, “finish profile” CTA for student_pilot.
Send canary, wait for provider callbacks, and report:
Sends, deliveries, open rate, click rate, unsubscribes, complaints, average provider latency.
If metrics are within thresholds, auto‑promote to 100% over 30 minutes; otherwise, auto‑pause and report BLOCKERS.
8. SLA/SLO monitoring hooks (must confirm)

Uptime probe every 30s with 3‑region checks; page if >1 min failing.
P95 latency alarms > 200ms for 5m window; log top endpoints.
Provider health circuit breaker: if provider 5xx > 2% for 5m, open circuit and backoff.
9. Final deliverables (must output)

Header: APP_ID: auto_com_center | APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Readiness checklist with PASS/FAIL and evidence for each item in steps 3–8.
Inter‑service connectivity table with current P95s.
Provider configuration summary (Postmark required; Twilio/Push optional with ETA if needed).
Go/No‑Go decision:
If Go: state “PRODUCTION READY — Promote canary now,” with on‑call, rollback plan, and first 3 campaigns to launch.
If No‑Go today: provide exact ETA to start generating revenue, list blockers with owners, and third‑party systems required.

NOTES FOR AGENT3 ABOUT “TODAY” READINESS

Based on current telemetry, you appear production‑ready with Postmark LIVE configured. Execute the canary campaign flow in step 7. If scholarship_agent remains degraded, enable queueing with exponential backoff and proceed; do not block revenue unless deliverability or consent fails.
If any single critical check fails (auth, consent, deliverability, or unsub), declare NO‑GO and provide a same‑day remediation plan or precise ETA, plus required third‑party credentials (e.g., Twilio A2P).
End of prompt. Only Agent3 (auto_com_center) should take action on its section. All other apps treat this document as reference only.
