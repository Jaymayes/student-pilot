CEO Directive: Consolidated Go-Live Decisions, Gates, and ARR Plan (as of Nov 11)

Prime objective: hit $10M profitable ARR on a low-CAC, SEO-led engine while enforcing SLOs, Responsible AI, and HOTL governance. The activation “first document upload” remains the B2C North Star for conversion efficiency, consistent with the Playbook’s roadmap and telemetry focus on the Document Hub and activation funnel  . We will continue to leverage Replit’s reserved/autoscale deployment patterns with disciplined release gating, monitoring, and rollback, mindful of platform constraints and vendor lock-in risks documented in our deployment/readiness analyses   . HOTL gates, explainability, and auditable request_id lineage remain mandatory for launch decisions .

Decisions and status by app

APPLICATION NAME: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: GO-LIVE READY (Frozen) — Approved. Maintain freeze through Nov 12, 20:00 UTC. Hold page generation on CWV p75 regression or indexation <92% auto-alert.
KPI cadence: Continue 06:00 UTC daily SEO KPI export.
Post-freeze: Add structured data validation, 404/soft-404 monitoring, weekly crawl budget snapshot.
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: DELAYED (Waitlist; Conditional GO). Gate B (Stripe) E2E at Nov 11, 18:00 UTC; evidence due 18:15. Earliest revenue Nov 14–15 contingent on Gates B + C + CEO GO.
Controls: Waitlist mode enforced; no charges until FULL GO. Complete request_id lineage and deterministic 3% fee events required at evidence time.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: GO-LIVE READY (Frozen) — Approved. Integration guide, rate limits, backoff, and SLO dashboards accepted.
Freeze: Through Nov 12, 20:00 UTC; rollback ≤5 min. Use multi-instance rate limiting post-freeze per readiness checklist practices .
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: GO-LIVE READY (Observer/Frozen) — Approved. Continue 06:00 UTC cross-app KPI rollups (B2C, B2B, SLO, Gate tracker). Fairness telemetry implementation post-freeze; HOTL evidence and explainability targets remain required .
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: GO-LIVE READY (Observer/Frozen) — Approved. No autonomous sends until student_pilot GO + Gate A PASS. Parity remediation sprint authorized post Gate C. Maintain ≥95% rationale coverage and full audit trails per HOTL/explainability policy .
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: PENDING — Gate C Performance (Nov 12, 20:00–20:15 UTC). PASS criteria: P95 ≤120ms, error ≤0.1%, success ≥99.5%, with JWKS rotation, MFA, HSTS, anti-replay evidence. Zero-trust posture and MFA/SSO readiness remain non-negotiable; align to continuous verification principles and future WebAuthn integration path .
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: PENDING — Gate A Deliverability (Nov 11, 20:00–20:15 UTC). PASS requires SPF/DKIM aligned, DMARC p=quarantine, ≥80% inbox, complaints ≤0.1%, bounces ≤2%. If DKIM still blocked at the 14:00 UTC escalation checkpoint, prepare pivot to SendGrid or SES per contingency; in-app notification fallback is mandated to protect funnel continuity. Maintain evidence bundle: Postmark exports, seed inbox outcomes, raw DNS verifications.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Decision: CEO GO/NO-GO set for Nov 13, 16:00 UTC — Conditional on Gate A PASS + Gate C PASS + activation telemetry (profile completion, first scholarship saved, first draft, first submission) confirmed in the 06:00 UTC rollup. Accessibility ≥ WCAG 2.1 AA 90%+ accepted; PWA/offline plan noted. This aligns with our activation-first roadmap emphasis on the Document Hub and essay-driven value creation feeding conversion and ARPU .
Gate schedule and conditions

Gate B (Stripe, provider_register): Nov 11, 18:00–18:15 UTC. If Finance sign-off is delayed, log technical PASS/FAIL and escalate; remain in waitlist mode.
Gate A (Deliverability, auto_com_center): Nov 11, 20:00–20:15 UTC. If FAIL, immediate switch to in-app notifications, retry Nov 12, 12:00 UTC; alternate ESP pivot if DNS is not resolved post-escalation.
Gate C (Auth P95, scholar_auth): Nov 12, 20:00–20:15 UTC. If FAIL, student_pilot and provider_register remain gated; hold B2C/B2B ignition until PASS.
ARR ignition plan

B2C credits: Earliest Nov 13–15 pending Gates A + C. Focus on increasing activation via first document upload; integrate essay-signal into matching over roadmap to improve “implicit fit” and conversion efficiency .
B2B 3% fees: Earliest Nov 14–15 pending Gates B + C. Preserve organic acquisition from auto_page_maker to keep CAC near-zero; cadence and quotas enforced through scholarship_api with resilient backoff and monitoring .
Risk and governance

Platform risk: Replit vendor lock-in and scale constraints acknowledged; continue disciplined deployment choices (reserved VM vs autoscale) and snapshot-based releases with monitoring/rollback per readiness guide .
HOTL/Explainability: Maintain approval gates, override mechanisms, and decision traceability across agents; no black-box decisioning in user-facing flows .
Security/Compliance: Zero-trust auth, MFA/SSO, encryption in transit/at rest, RBAC, and audit logging enforced; scholar_auth to track toward passwordless readiness as feasible .
CEO asks (due today unless noted)

Agent3: Provide Section V-formatted Status Reports (header with APPLICATION NAME + APP_BASE_URL) for scholar_auth, auto_com_center, and student_pilot to complete the 8-app set; include evidence links or blockers with ETAs per the Gate timeline.
provider_register: Deliver Gate B evidence by 18:15 UTC; keep waitlist mode enforced until CEO FULL GO.
auto_com_center: Deliver Gate A evidence by 20:15 UTC; include raw DNS “dig” outputs and seed inbox results.
scholarship_sage: Ship the 06:00 UTC daily rollup; add Gate outcomes as they complete.
All apps: Prepare DR test artifacts per plan (RPO ≤15m, RTO ≤30m) and data retention schedules by the stated dates.
This memo affirms our market and product strategy while enforcing disciplined, data-first gates to protect the SEO flywheel, maintain CAC near zero, and accelerate toward the $10M ARR plan with responsible AI controls intact     .
