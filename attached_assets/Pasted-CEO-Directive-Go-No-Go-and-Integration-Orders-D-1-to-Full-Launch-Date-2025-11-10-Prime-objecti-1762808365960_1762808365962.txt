CEO Directive: Go/No‑Go and Integration Orders (D-1 to Full Launch)
Date: 2025-11-10
Prime objective alignment: Decisions below prioritize fast, low-CAC growth through Auto Page Maker, uphold 99.9%/120ms SLOs, and protect revenue ramp to $10M ARR with Responsible AI and auditability.

APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Observer/Frozen)
CEO Decision: Approved to remain in observer/frozen mode through Nov 12. Daily fairness rollups required by 12:00 UTC. No autonomous sends until student_pilot is FULL GO.

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: PARTIAL GO
CEO Decision: APPROVE Reserved VM deployment for queue worker now. Block email sends until Postmark DKIM/CNAME verified and deliverability green. Target: T+24h. Rollback ready within 5 minutes.
Blockers: Postmark DNS verification.
Next Checkpoint: Nov 11, 20:00 UTC (deliverability gate).

APPLICATION NAME: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Frozen through Nov 12)
CEO Decision: Affirmed. Maintain change freeze. Continue daily KPI rollups (indexation ≥95%, CWV p75 GREEN, P95 ≈100ms, zero publish errors). This remains our primary low-CAC engine.

APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: CONDITIONAL GO
CEO Decision: UPGRADE to FULL GO now. SLOs reported with strong headroom. Maintain freeze through Nov 12 and continue producing request_id traces and audit logs. This is the backbone for eligibility, pricing, and deterministic outcomes.

APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: CONDITIONAL GO (48-hour performance remediation)
CEO Decision: Proceed with controlled pre‑soak per schedule. Hard deadline to meet ≤120ms P95 by Nov 12, 20:00 UTC. Enforce MFA, SSO, RBAC, strong session/token hygiene, and complete audit logging. No downstream FULL GO lifts can stand if auth degrades—priority monitoring in place.

APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: CONDITIONAL GO (waitlist mode)
CEO Decision: Hold in waitlist mode. FULL GO gated on: 1) Stripe PASS confirmation, 2) auto_com_center deliverability green, 3) scholar_auth pre‑soak stability. Prepare pre‑soak Nov 11 01:45–02:45 UTC; submit T+30 evidence by 03:15 UTC.
Blockers: Stripe PASS overdue; email deliverability dependent on auto_com_center.

APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED
CEO Decision: Select Option B (Recommended). Delay launch 48 hours for production pre‑soak and performance tuning to meet ≤120ms P95. In‑app notifications non‑blocking for GA; confirm that SSO flow is solid and that email is not a hard dependency. Present quantified pre/post metrics in T+24 and T+48 rollups.
Estimated Go‑Live: Nov 13, 16:00 UTC (subject to SLO pass).
Notes: This is our student-facing growth driver; do not compromise first‑impression performance.

APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY (Observer/Frozen)
CEO Decision: Maintain observer mode. Activate dashboards for activation, conversion, ARPU, provider funnel, fairness, and revenue telemetry. No schema changes until Nov 12 freeze lifts.

Cross‑App, Section IV Compliance Directives (applies to all DRIs)

Security and Compliance
Enforce MFA/SSO via scholar_auth across all user surfaces. RBAC minimums: student, provider, analyst, admin. Confirm TLS everywhere; rotate keys/secrets; ship structured, PII‑safe audit logs with request_id propagation.
Scalability & Performance
SLOs: 99.9% uptime, ≤120ms P95 for user‑facing endpoints. Set HOTL monitors and page on breach. Maintain blue/green or reserved VM rollback.
Integration & Interoperability
All inter‑app calls use signed, documented APIs. Validate end‑to‑end: student_pilot → scholar_auth (OIDC/PKCE) → scholarship_api (eligibility) → auto_com_center (notifications gated) → scholarship_sage (BI).
Reliability & DR
Daily backups, restore drills documented. “Big red button” rollback verified (<5 minutes) for all production changes.
Responsible AI
Keep scholarship_agent fairness telemetry daily with rationale coverage ≥95% and parity rule checks reported to scholarship_sage. No black‑box decisions in eligibility; preserve explanations.
ARR Ignition Plan and Dates

Immediate ARR impact
auto_page_maker: Traffic and indexed pages feed top‑of‑funnel today. Owners to report daily: sessions, CTR, sign‑ups, free→paid conversion, and credit ARPU.
scholarship_api: Enablement layer—unblocks monetization paths now.
Conditional/near‑term ARR
provider_register: ARR starts upon Stripe PASS + deliverability green + first provider onboarded. Target: Nov 14.
student_pilot: ARR from credit sales begins post‑launch. Target: Nov 14–15.
Support/Amplifiers (non‑direct ARR)
scholar_auth, auto_com_center, scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent (observer) underpin trust, comms, analytics, and future autonomous growth.
CEO Approvals Issued Now

auto_com_center: Reserved VM deployment APPROVED; hold email until DNS verified.
scholarship_api: FULL GO APPROVED; maintain freeze and evidence production.
student_pilot: Option B APPROVED; delay to Nov 13, 16:00 UTC with pre‑soak and SLO tuning.
provider_register: Waitlist mode continues; FULL GO gated on Stripe PASS + deliverability + auth stability.
scholar_auth: Proceed with pre‑soak; 48‑hour performance remediation deadline firm.

KPIs to Report Daily (by 06:00 UTC)

B2C: New sessions from SEO, sign‑ups, free→paid conversion, ARPU, refunds/chargebacks.
B2B: Active providers, gross volume, 3% platform fee revenue.
Platform: Uptime, P95, error rate, auth success rate, fairness/rationale coverage.
CAC: Organic share of sign‑ups; track paid to zero for now.
If anything here conflicts with a critical security or compliance requirement, security wins. Otherwise, execute these orders immediately and acknowledge with updated Section V reports per app, including APP_BASE_URL at the top and current Status line.
