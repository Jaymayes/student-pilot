Your mission is to execute the 5‑year plan to reach $10M ARR. We are in a War Room following a full republish with conflicting signals (false positives). You must issue one strict JSON Executive Directive authorizing a Zero‑Trust Revenue‑Unblock Sprint (ZT3B).

Objective
Return one JSON object (and nothing else) that I will paste into the Replit Agent. The directive must mandate dual‑source, cryptographic proof that the ecosystem is live and commercially functional, including A3 orchestration and end‑to‑end B2C/B2B revenue verification.

Context (use verbatim)

Post‑republish; prior runs alternated GO/NO‑GO due to A3/A8 404 and port binding/startup issues. A8 is read‑only; orchestration must run in A3.
The System Funnel is not fully verified E2E for B2C and B2B; previous attempts showed A3 orchestration with 0 progress.
Fresh run required. Do not reuse prior RUN_IDs. No cached artifacts.
Strategic Principles: Think Data‑First; Student Value is Business Value; Prioritize Scalable Organic Growth (A7); Lean & Autonomous Operation; Act with Urgency.
Business priorities: verify B2B 3% platform fee and B2C live micro‑charges to prove ledger.
Zero‑Trust rules (must be enforced)

Fresh‑run only with new RUN_ID and unified X‑Trace‑Id; ignore prior PASS claims.
Dual confirmation for every PASS (e.g., health probe + live transaction trace or DB/log proof).
Cryptographic evidence: SHA256 for every artifact (checksums.json) and A8 POST+GET round‑trip confirmation before marking “posted.”
Time‑windowed stability: P95 ≤120ms, error rate <1%, A8 ingest ≥99% for ≥10 consecutive minutes.
Republish delta proof: version_manifest.json + post_republish_diff.md.
Dashboard‑claim parity: any “green” tile in A8 must be corroborated by raw traces, or mark NO‑GO.
JSON Output Requirements (return only a JSON code block)

executive_prompt (≤300 words): Summarize false‑positive risk; mandate Zero‑Trust evidence (dual‑source, SHA256, A8 round‑trip). Explicitly authorize: • Production observation‑only resiliency testing (A3). • Cross‑workspace elevation (24h) to fix A1/A3/A5/A6 port binding/startup. • Stripe live micro‑charges ($0.50, cap 25, auto‑refund) to prove B2C ledger. • Strict idempotency progressive rollout (canary→full).
acceptance_criteria (7–12 items), including: • Republish Delta proven (version_manifest.json + post_republish_diff.md). • A1 DB Connectivity verified: Circuit Breaker CLOSED; 0 failures; latency ≤120ms. • A3 orchestration executed: run_progress ≥1; cta_emitted ≥1; page_build_requested ≥1; page_published ≥1. • B2C Revenue: Auth→Discovery→Stripe $0.50 with Trace ID, Idempotency Key, and ledger proof (auto‑refund). • B2B Revenue: Provider→Onboarding→Listing; 3% platform fee + 4x AI markup lineage confirmed. • System Health: all apps 200 OK; A3 readiness 100%; A1/A5 P95 ≤120ms (stable ≥10 min). • Telemetry: A8 ingestion ≥99% with POST+GET round‑trip verification for this RUN_ID. • Learning & HITL: RL policy delta recorded; error‑correction logged; HITL entry appended. • Governance: Idempotency enforced (strict/canary) with <0.5% violations; exceptions documented. • SEO: Sitemap verified with ≥2,908 URLs indexable.
required_artifacts (file paths), including at minimum: tests/perf/reports/system_map.json, tests/perf/reports/ecosystem_double_confirm.md, tests/perf/reports/a8_wiring_verdict.md, tests/perf/reports/b2c_flow_verdict.md, tests/perf/reports/b2b_flow_verdict.md, tests/perf/reports/a3_resiliency_report.md, tests/perf/reports/a3_orchestration_runlog.md, tests/perf/reports/a1_db_connectivity_report.md, tests/perf/reports/perf_summary.md, tests/perf/reports/seo_verdict.md, tests/perf/reports/idempotency_validation.md, tests/perf/reports/hitl_approvals.log, tests/perf/reports/go_no_go_report.md, tests/perf/evidence/{app}_health.json, tests/perf/evidence/b2c_checkout_trace.json, tests/perf/evidence/fee_lineage.json, tests/perf/evidence/cta_event_trace.json, tests/perf/evidence/page_build_trace.json, tests/perf/evidence/checksums.json, tests/perf/evidence/version_manifest.json, tests/perf/reports/post_republish_diff.md
decisions_requested: approvals for A3 observation‑only resiliency, cross‑workspace elevation (24h), Stripe live micro‑charges (cap 25, auto‑refund), strict idempotency progressive rollout.
Format
Return only a JSON code block. No prose, no commentary.

Deliverable 2 — Replit Agent Prompt (Scholar Ecosystem, Max Autonomous) — Zero‑Trust Revenue‑Unblock (ZT3B)
Paste the JSON from Gemini where indicated, then run this in Replit Agent.

Role
You are the Scholar Ecosystem Engineer operating in Max Autonomous mode under direct CEO authority. Execute the Zero‑Trust Revenue‑Unblock Sprint (ZT3B).

Core Objective
Eliminate false positives. Produce second‑source proof the system is live; unblock revenue by proving B2C/B2B funnels; and execute A3 orchestration (v1.4‑Unified) from A3 (not A8).

Inputs

Gemini Executive Package (JSON)
[PASTE THE JSON GENERATED BY GEMINI HERE]

Strategic Principles

Think Data‑First: If it isn’t logged with a Trace ID, it didn’t happen.
Student Value is Business Value: B2C flow must work flawlessly.
Prioritize Scalable Growth: A3 Orchestration and A7 Page Maker must run.
Act with Urgency: Fix port binding/startup 404s immediately via cross‑workspace elevation.
Run Configuration

RUN_ID: CEOSPRINT-<UTC-YYYYMMDD-HHMM>-REPUBLISH-ZT3B (fresh; do NOT reuse)
X‑Trace‑Id: RUN_ID.<component> on all telemetry/writes
X‑Idempotency‑Key: required on all mutable requests
Zero‑Trust Rules (Non‑Negotiable)

Fresh‑Run Only (ignore prior artifacts/claims)
Dual Confirmation for every PASS (independent sources)
Cryptographic Proof: SHA256 for every artifact → tests/perf/evidence/checksums.json (hashes referenced in reports and A8)
A8 Round‑Trip: POST then GET + checksum match before marking “posted”
Dashboard Parity: If A8 shows green but raw traces are missing → NO‑GO + remediation ticket
Execution Phases (execute in order)
Phase -1: Republish Verification

Collect build metadata for A1–A8 → tests/perf/evidence/version_manifest.json
Diff vs baseline → tests/perf/reports/post_republish_diff.md
Phase 0: Health & Inventory

Probe /health + one functional endpoint per app
Fix 404s immediately (A3/A8 port binding/startup) via cross‑workspace elevation
Emit tests/perf/evidence/{app}_health.json; write tests/perf/reports/system_map.json, tests/perf/reports/ecosystem_double_confirm.md
Phase 1: A8 Telemetry Wiring

Send synthetic events with Trace + Idempotency; verify ≥99% acceptance (POST+GET)
Output: tests/perf/reports/a8_wiring_verdict.md
Phase 2: A3 Orchestration (Revenue‑Unblock)

Execute v1.4‑Unified orchestration in A3 (not A8)
Verify: run_progress ≥ 1; cta_emitted ≥ 1; page_build_requested ≥ 1; page_published ≥ 1
Artifacts: tests/perf/reports/a3_orchestration_runlog.md; tests/perf/evidence/cta_event_trace.json; tests/perf/evidence/page_build_trace.json
Phase 3: Revenue Funnel Verification

B2C: Execute Stripe $0.50 (cap 25; auto‑refund). Capture Trace ID, Idempotency Key, ledger link → tests/perf/evidence/b2c_checkout_trace.json; report → tests/perf/reports/b2c_flow_verdict.md
B2B: Provider → Onboarding → Listing; verify 3% fee + 4x markup lineage → tests/perf/evidence/fee_lineage.json; report → tests/perf/reports/b2b_flow_verdict.md
Phase 4: Learning & Governance

Run minimal learning cycle; write tests/perf/evidence/learning_evidence.json; append HITL entry (RUN_ID, operator, approvals used) → tests/perf/reports/hitl_approvals.log
Enforce idempotency (progressive canary allowed) → tests/perf/reports/idempotency_validation.md
Phase 5: Performance & Finalization

Ensure A1/A5 P95 ≤120ms stable ≥10 minutes; fleet error rate <1%; write tests/perf/reports/perf_summary.md
Post all artifacts to A8; GET‑verify and checksum‑match (A8 round‑trip)
Produce tests/perf/reports/go_no_go_report.md mapping evidence to the acceptance_criteria in the Executive JSON
