ACT AS: Senior Systems Architect and Chief Revenue Officer.

CONTEXT: We are managing a multi-application ecosystem. The goal is to ensure all tools work together seamlessly to achieve four specific outcomes:

Marketing: Maximizing reach and engagement.

Lead Gen: Capturing and qualifying high-quality leads.

Revenue: Converting leads into sales and maximizing Lifetime Value (LTV).

Learning: Using data from sales outcomes to automatically improve marketing strategies (Recursive Improvement).

YOUR MISSION: Conduct a ruthless, forensic audit of the current system and generate an extremely detailed "State of the Union" report. You must identify exactly where the friction lies, inventory your full capabilities, and define exactly what external data you are missing to exceed our goals.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Please generate the report using the following four-part structure. Be technical, specific, and brutally honest.

PART 1: THE BLOCKER & FRICTION REPORT (The "Why We Are Stuck" Analysis)
Identify every specific obstacle preventing the ecosystem from running at 100% efficiency. Do not be vague.

Integration Severances: List every point where two apps should be exchanging data but aren't (e.g., "Marketing data is not triggering Lead Gen workflows instantly").

Technical Bottlenecks: List specific API limits, latency issues, authentication errors, or software incompatibilities.

Logic Gaps: Where does the workflow fail? (e.g., "We generate the lead, but the app lacks the logic to assign a revenue value").

Resource Constraints: Are we limited by compute power, storage, or lack of user input?

Impact Score: For each blocker, assign a severity score (1-10) based on how much it hinders Revenue.

PART 2: COMPREHENSIVE CAPABILITY INVENTORY (The "Arsenal")
List every single capability currently available to you across all connected apps so we can ensure we are utilizing you fully.

Marketing Engines: (e.g., Content generation, social posting, SEO analysis, ad bidding).

Lead Processing: (e.g., Data scraping, email enrichment, CRM tagging, intent detection).

Revenue Tools: (e.g., Payment gateways, dynamic pricing, contract automation, upsell logic).

Analytical Brain: (e.g., Pattern recognition, A/B testing, sentiment analysis).

PART 3: THE INTEROPERABILITY MATRIX (The "Connection" Check)
Analyze how the apps work together.

The Handshake: Describe the current flow of data from Marketing → Lead Gen → Revenue. Is it automated or manual?

The Feedback Loop: currently, how does a "Won Deal" or "Lost Deal" in the Revenue stage update the strategy in the Marketing stage? If this loop does not exist, explicitly state: "No Learning Loop Detected."

PART 4: DATA ACQUISITION & RESEARCH WISHLIST (The "Growth Fuel")
To move from "meeting goals" to "exceeding goals," you need more information. List the specific research or data you need.

Market Intelligence: What specific industry trends, competitor pricing, or news feeds do you need access to?

User Data: What granular details about our Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) are you missing?

Specific Research Request: List specific topics or URLs you want the human team to research and feed into your system to improve your predictive model. Format: "If I had access to [DATA], I could improve [GOAL] by [ESTIMATE]."

How to use the output you get back
Review Part 1 (Blockers): This is your technical "To-Do" list. If the app says "I cannot access the CRM API," that is a specific task you need to fix or ask a developer to fix.

Analyze Part 3 (The Loop): This is the most critical part for "Learning." If the app says "No Learning Loop Detected," your next goal is to build an automation (using Zapier/Make) that sends sales data back to the AI.

Action Part 4 (Research): This is your homework. When the app lists the research it needs (e.g., "I need competitor pricing for Q4"), you should go find that data and paste it back into the chat. This fulfills the requirement for the app to "meet and exceed goals."
