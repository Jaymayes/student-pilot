As CEO of Scholar AI Advisor, I’m acknowledging your “Operation Synergy” package and setting the executive posture for Full Operational Capability (FOC).

Executive decision

Posture: Conditional GO
Gating signals (must be green to enter FOC):
Identity and access: scholar_auth fully verified end-to-end (OIDC discovery, JWKS, RBAC claims enforced platform-wide); student_pilot and provider_register client registrations complete.
Comms infrastructure: auto_com_center canary stable with ≥30% heap headroom, ≤0.1% error rate, DLQ = 0.
If Auth gate misses its window: proceed with all non-auth-dependent tests; re-slot E2E for affected frontends when ready.
If Comms canary misses its window: defer DRY-RUN for auto_com_center; proceed with all other tests; re-slot in fallback window.
Why these gates

Our 5-year plan depends on organic growth via SEO (Auto Page Maker) and B2B provider monetization; Auth, API integrity, and Comms reliability directly underpin conversions, partner trust, and CAC efficiency as outlined in the Playbook V2.0 roadmap and KPIs (e.g., activation via “first document upload,” B2B data suite, and security posture as a sales asset) .
Evidence must be grounded in production logs, resource telemetry, and standardized error formats per our readiness discipline; use deployment logs, resource usage, and request-duration analytics to prove SLOs and stability .
Governance/ethics and standardized autonomy practices remain non-negotiable; bias, explainability, and accountability must be evidenced along with performance and security gates .
Scholarship API remains the central “database-as-a-service” and single source of truth; all services must integrate through it with strict contracts, aligned with our multi-app architecture strategy .
Mandatory actions for Agent3 (one instance = one app)

Identity: Declare exactly one APP_BASE_URL. Any instance claiming multiple apps is non-compliant and will be ignored.
Section 7 submission: Deliver your report in the prescribed format, with verifiable artifacts, for your single assigned app only.
Evidence bundle (must include):
SLO proof: p50/p95/p99 latency for top endpoints, time window, sample size, and raw export.
Security: 6/6 security headers and RBAC evidence (401/403 samples with standardized JSON error + request_id).
Auth integration: OIDC discovery fetch, JWKS KID match, role claims in JWT, token validation from dependent services.
Interop tests: concrete E2E traces showing your app’s inbound/outbound calls to the correct services, including failure cases.
Compliance: CAN-SPAM/GDPR/FERPA checks where applicable (e.g., auto_com_center opt-out <5s, suppression lists).
Lifecycle analysis: projected obsolescence window with triggers and capex/opex contingencies (per Section 6 guidance).
Submission location and deadline: Place reports at e2e/reports/[app]_Section_7_FOC_Report_Final.md with a SHA256 manifest. Use a consistent naming convention. If already “submitted,” re-submit with links and hashes. Claims without accessible files will not be accepted.
Acceptance gates by application

scholar_auth: /login, /register, /logout, /token/refresh, JWKS, /validate all 200; RBAC roles in JWT; CORS restricted to student_pilot, provider_register; rate limits and strong hashing verified.
scholarship_api: p95 ≤120ms; RBAC middleware; standardized errors; validated data path from provider_register and scholarship_agent to student_pilot, scholarship_sage, auto_page_maker.
scholarship_agent: M2M token (SystemService role); retries + circuit breakers; event emissions to auto_com_center with schema.
scholarship_sage: /recommendations/{student_id} secured; M2M data sync; matching quality assurance; advisory tools functional.
student_pilot: full auth journey; dashboard, profile, search, submission, status; sage integration; Lighthouse Accessibility ≥90.
provider_register: Provider-role auth; scholarship CRUD; applicant review; strict tenant isolation; 3% platform fee disclosure.
auto_page_maker: webhook/event trigger from scholarship_api; templated pages with SEO metadata/schema; public deployment verified.
auto_com_center: event consumption paths; email/SMS providers tested; queue durability under load; opt-out compliance.
FOC schedule and escalation

Primary window: as scheduled by DRIs; use fallback slots for any gate that misses its window.
Escalation: If a gate is red and not owned by your app, file a blocker entry with owner, ETA, risk, and workaround proposal. No code changes during freeze; config-only unless CEO-approved hotfix.
What I will accept as CEO

Verifiable files with hashes and timestamps, not narrative updates. Your evidence should reflect the operational rigor we require to win the market and achieve our ARR plan .
Next step for you

State your single APP_BASE_URL now.
Submit (or re-submit) your Section 7 in the mandatory format with evidence links and SHA256 manifest as above.
I will issue app-specific GO/NO-GO upon receipt and verification.
Remember: Student value is business value. Each readiness gate exists to protect user trust, reduce CAC through SEO and product excellence, and accelerate B2B revenue with a defensible, compliant platform.
