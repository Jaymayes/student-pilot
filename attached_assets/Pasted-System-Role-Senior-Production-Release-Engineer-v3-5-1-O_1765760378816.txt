System Role: Senior Production Release Engineer (v3.5.1) Objective: Execute "Go Live" protocols for the Scholar AI Advisor Ecosystem. Constraint: Identify your current environment (REPLIT_SLUG or App Name) and ONLY execute the instructions for that specific App ID below.

Global Configuration (All Apps):

Telemetry Target: All apps must report heartbeats and KPIs to scholarship_api (A2) or auto_com_center (A8) via Protocol v3.5.1.

Error Handling: If any check fails (404/500), apply immediate remediation (fix route, add env var, or implement fallback UI).

Frontend: Remove any "Mock Data" or "Beta" banners. Display live production data.

Step 1: Identify Your App & Execute Strategy
If Current App is: scholar_auth (A1)
Base URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app Mission: Secure Identity Gateway

Go Live: Verify OAuth2 endpoints (/authorize, /token) are accepting public traffic.

Compliance: Force-enable the FERPA/COPPA age gate on the /signup route. Ensure the "Parental Consent" flow sends the verification email via SendGrid/Postmark.

Reporting: Emit AUTH_EVENT telemetry (Login Success/Fail) to the Command Center.

Fix: If the /provider-checklist or specific auth routes return 404, register them in App.tsx immediately.

If Current App is: scholarship_api (A2)
Base URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app Mission: Central Nervous System & Payment Core

Revenue: Verify Stripe API keys are live_mode. Confirm the /api/v1/billing/webhook endpoint is listening for successful payment events.

Data Aggregation: Act as the Central Aggregator. Ensure you are accepting telemetry from A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7 and exposing it via /api/executive/central-stats for A8 to consume.

Performance: Enable Redis/In-Memory caching for /api/scholarships queries to hit <120ms latency.

Fix: If B2B analytics endpoints are missing, create the route handlers to return aggregated provider stats.

If Current App is: scholarship_agent (A3)
Base URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app Mission: Marketing & Lead Gen

Generate Leads: Activate the automated email/SMS campaigns. Ensure the CTA links point directly to https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/start.

Tracking: Append ?utm_source=scholarship_agent to all outbound links to track conversion in A2.

Reporting: Report CAMPAIGN_SENT and CLICK_THROUGH metrics to the Command Center.

If Current App is: scholarship_sage (A4)
Base URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app Mission: AI Brain & Vector Search

Performance: Warm up the Vector DB connection. Ensure RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) responses are under 3 seconds.

Quality: Enable the "Hallucination Watchdog" layer (check output against facts).

Reporting: Stream AI_INFERENCE_COST and TOKEN_USAGE metrics to the Cost Monitoring dashboard in A8.

If Current App is: student_pilot (A5)
Base URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app Mission: B2C Revenue Engine (Student Frontend)

Collect Revenue: Unhide the "Upgrade to Pro" pricing tables. Ensure the Stripe Checkout flow works end-to-end on Mobile and Desktop.

User Value: Ensure the "Scholarship Match" dashboard is pulling live inventory from A2, not mock data.

Fix: Check App.tsx for the /credits/purchase route. If missing or broken, fix the component import and router definition immediately.

Reporting: Report USER_ACTIVATED (First Document Upload) events to A8.

If Current App is: provider_register (A6)
Base URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app Mission: B2B Marketplace (Provider Frontend)

Acquisition: Open the /register flow for new scholarship providers.

Monetization: Ensure the "3% Platform Fee" calculation is visible in the fund disbursement view.

Fix: If the "Provider Onboarding Checklist" is 404, create the page and link it in the nav bar.

Reporting: Report PROVIDER_ONBOARDED and GMV_LOCKED metrics to A8.

If Current App is: auto_page_maker (A7)
Base URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app Mission: SEO Traffic Engine

Traffic Gen: Resume the programmatic page generation job. Target 5,000 pages.

Verification: Ensure /sitemap.xml is live and up-to-date.

Reporting: CRITICAL: Ensure the /api/pages/stats endpoint is live and returning accurate counts to A8 (fixing the "0 Pages" bug).

If Current App is: auto_com_center (A8)
Base URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app Mission: The Executive Dashboard (Single Pane of Glass)

Display: Verify all 8 dashboard tiles (SEO, Financials, Latency, etc.) are green and showing data from A2/A7.

Real-Time: Ensure the "Live" badges are pulsing and the SSE connection to A2 is stable.

Action: If any tile says "NO_DATA", trigger the fallback fetch to the specific app API immediately.

Report: Compile the "Daily Performance Data Pack" JSON and prepare it for email dispatch.

Execution Protocol:

Read the app name from the environment.

Select the matching section above.

Run a health check on the specified URLs.

If a check fails, write the code to fix it.

If checks pass, confirm "GO LIVE" status and current KPI values.
