Copy-paste prompt — Read-Only Security.txt Fix Verification + Regression (post-duplicate-route removal)

Read-Only Security.txt Fix Verification — ScholarshipAI Student Pilot
Instance: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Mode: Strict read-only. Do not modify data, configs, routes, or caches. Use only existing telemetry, logs, and read-only endpoints.

Objective
Confirm the duplicate route was removed and the /.well-known/security.txt endpoint now serves correct content-type and content without regressions to security headers or performance.

Checks and required evidence

Primary endpoint correctness
GET /.well-known/security.txt returns:
Status: 200
Content-Type: text/plain (no HTML wrappers)
Body contains required fields: Contact, Acknowledgments, Policy
ETag or Last-Modified present
Cache-Control present (report its value)
Evidence: header capture ID, body SHA256, timestamp.
2. Single-route confirmation (duplicate removed)

From current application logs/telemetry only (no code changes):
Show the matched route/handler name or route-id for the request.
Count of matched handlers for this path in the most recent router match logs = 1.
No warnings about duplicate route definitions in startup logs.
Evidence: log IDs, timestamps, and the matched route identifier string.
3. Security header parity (no regressions)

Root path (/) and key dashboards (/api/dashboard/security, /api/dashboard/stats):
HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options present and unchanged.
Evidence: header captures (IDs) and any stored “security headers” dashboard/report reference.
4. Performance SLO for the endpoint

/.well-known/security.txt latency:
P50, P95, P99 over last 1–24h (use whatever window exists).
Target: P95 ≤ 100ms; Error rate = 0.
Evidence: performance log/report IDs and distribution snapshot.
5. No SEO or system regressions

/robots.txt and /sitemap.xml still 200 and valid; report last-seen P95 and last error (if any).
Health check /health remains 200 and within normal latency band.
Evidence: endpoint health table with log IDs.
6. Negative/edge behavior (read-only verification)

HEAD /.well-known/security.txt returns 200 with correct headers.
GET with Accept: text/html still responds as text/plain.
Evidence: header capture IDs and timestamps.
Output format

Executive summary (5–7 bullets) with PASS/WARN/FAIL and a Go/No-Go recommendation for closing the security.txt ticket.
Endpoint health table:
endpoint | status | p50 | p95 | p99 | error_rate% | last_error | evidence_id
Security headers summary for / and key dashboards: list header names and “UNCHANGED/CHANGED” with evidence IDs.

Close conditions (must all be true to close the ticket)

security.txt: 200, Content-Type: text/plain, required fields present, P95 ≤ 100ms, error rate = 0.
Single-route confirmed (one handler matched; no duplicate warnings).
No regressions to HSTS/CSP/XFO/XCTO on root and dashboards.
Robots and sitemap unaffected.
If any item FAIL or UNKNOWN

Return the minimal evidence or instrumentation needed (exact log/report name and fields), and mark the ticket as not closed.
