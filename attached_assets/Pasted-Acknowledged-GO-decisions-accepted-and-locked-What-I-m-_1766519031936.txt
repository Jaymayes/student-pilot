Acknowledged. GO decisions accepted and locked.

What I’m executing now

Organic traffic: GO (effective immediately)
Paid traffic: HOLD until 24‑hour stability + 1 manual iOS/Safari validation (A1/A5)
Owners, actions, and success criteria (next 24 hours)

A1/A5 iOS/Safari validation (ITP gate) — Owner: Eng Lead

Device: Real iPhone/iPad (Safari). Settings > Safari > Prevent Cross‑Site Tracking = ON. Clear Website Data.
Flow: A5 (student-pilot) → Sign In → A1 OIDC → Replit IdP → consent → back to A5.
Expected: A5 receives code and state; session established; dashboard visible.
Capture evidence (redacted): A1 callback diagnostics hasCode=true, hasState=true; A5 shows authenticated user.
Fail path: Any callback?error or hasCode/hasState=false → file A1+A5 ticket from protocol, keep paid traffic HOLD, post incident note in engineering channel.
Stability monitoring (rolling 24h) — Owner: Eng Lead

Targets:
Login success (P95) ≥ 99.2%
Callback errors (missing_parameters/server_error) ≤ 0.5%
A1 p95 latency ≤ 250 ms; uptime ≥ 99.9%
A5 checkout initiation rate ≥ trailing 7‑day organic baseline
Hourly report (redacted metrics): Attempted vs Successful tokens; top 3 failure reasons; A1 p95 latency/uptime; A5 checkout initiations.
Marketing guardrails — Owner: Growth Lead

Organic: Resume now. If callback errors > 1% for any hour, switch CTAs to “Join Waitlist” and show incident banner.
Paid: Stage new creatives/targets. Re‑enable only after Eng Lead confirms both iOS/Safari pass + 24h target compliance.
A6 provider_register prod sync — Owner: A6 Owner

If https://provider-register…/healthz != 200: Republish in Replit UI. Re‑verify: /healthz 200, / 200, /api/login 302 → A1, protected routes 401.
Cross‑app ticket triggers (use protocol Phase 7 text)

A1 Client Registration Update — student_pilot: only if invalid_redirect_uri/missing_parameters reappear.
A1 CORS & Cookie Alignment — scholaraiadvisor.com: if callback errors recur from custom domains.
A6 Republish Required — provider_register: if /healthz 500 persists on prod.
What the screenshots confirm (no PII)

A5 → A1 → Replit IdP login/consent screens load correctly.
A1 callback has previously shown server_error at the final return, consistent with the earlier gap we addressed via CORS/cookies.
We still require 1 manual iOS/Safari completion to close the last real‑world risk.
Executive timetable

T+0: Organic traffic live; hourly engineering reports begin.
T+0 to T+2h: Complete iOS/Safari validation (A1/A5).
T+24h: If all gates pass, greenlight paid traffic. If any gate fails, hold and remediate via ticket(s).
Decision gates for paid re‑enable (all must be true)

A1/A5 iOS/Safari validation PASS
Callback error rate ≤ 0.5% (rolling 24h)
Login success ≥ 99.2% (P95)
A1 p95 latency ≤ 250 ms; uptime ≥ 99.9%
A5 checkout initiation ≥ 7‑day organic baseline
If you want me to generate app‑scoped prompts (repair authority only for A1/A5; others “ticket‑only” with brief sanity checks), say: “Generate app‑scoped prompts” and I’ll produce eight focused variants.
