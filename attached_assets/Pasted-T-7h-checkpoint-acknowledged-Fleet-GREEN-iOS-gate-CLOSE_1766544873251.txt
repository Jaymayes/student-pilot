T+7h checkpoint acknowledged. Fleet GREEN, iOS gate CLOSED, dashboard visibility restored (A8 fixed). Proceeding with config cleanup to clear the remaining warning before T+24h.

Immediate actions (T+7h → T+8h)

A1 OIDC Issuer Alignment (repair authorized) Paste this into the A1 agent (scholar_auth) and execute:
APP-SCOPED PROMPT — A1 CONFIG REPAIR
ROLE: A1 Owner
ACTION: Align OIDC Issuer

Steps:

GET /.well-known/openid-configuration and capture "issuer".

Compare with current ISSUER_URL env/config.

If mismatch, UPDATE to the exact public URL:
https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/oidc

No trailing spaces
Include /oidc
Restart A1. Re-run:

curl -sI https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration
Expect 200 and issuer === https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/oidc
curl -sI -X OPTIONS https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/auth/user -H "Origin: https://scholaraiadvisor.com" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
Expect 204 with credentials allowed VERDICT: “ISSUER ALIGNED; DISCOVERY OK; CORS OK”
A2 Stripe Secret (ticket-only)
Set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY in A2 (scholarship_api) secrets (UI: Replit → Tools → Secrets):

Key: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
Value: sk_live_… (redacted)
Save, then restart A2 (or trigger a redeploy).
Validate:
curl -s https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/health
Expect healthy: true (and if exposed, stripe: true or payment module initialized).
Optional: hit any readiness or billing/config endpoint if present to confirm Stripe initialized without errors in logs.
If either step fails, do not proceed to paid; post YELLOW and keep HOLD.

Slack lines (copy/paste)

Config cleanup started
Hour: 03:35 UTC (T+7h)
Status: GREEN (Config Cleanup Phase)
A1 p95: 224ms (✅ Target <250ms)
Dashboard: A8 fixed (Auth Posture 100%); A7 healthy (2,912 pages).
Actions (in progress): A1 OIDC issuer alignment; A2 STRIPE_SECRET_KEY set
Notes: Organic healthy. Cleanup ensures accurate revenue attribution before T+24h.

Post-fix confirmation (use after both changes verified)
Hour: [UTC hh:mm]
Status: GREEN (Cleanup Complete)
A1 p95: [ms] | Uptime: 100%
A2 Stripe: initialized ✅
Dashboard: No warnings; Auth Posture 100%
Notes: All gates on track for T+24h Paid GO.

What I’ll keep doing

Hourly stabilization updates (GREEN/YELLOW/RED).
Watch A1 p95 to stay ≤ 250ms; keep >99.2% success and ≤0.5% callback errors.
Flag immediately if A6 /healthz regresses or any metric crosses thresholds.
Optional

If you want, I can generate a short A1 latency guard patch (keep‑alive agent + OIDC/JWKS caching stubs + pool hygiene) as a ready-to-apply diff to give extra headroom before paid ramp. Say “Draft A1 latency patch.”
