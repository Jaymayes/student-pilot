Below is the single, comprehensive Go‑Live prompt to paste into A3 (scholarship_agent). It is multi‑app, but includes an explicit Scope Guard so only A3 acts and all other apps simply log a NOTICE and keep serving their normal APIs. The structure and contracts reflect our Replit multi‑app architecture and microservice practices: explicit REST contracts, resilient retries, API‑key security, and event telemetry to a central command center for observability and reporting, as recommended for coordinated “teams” of apps on Replit  and for post‑launch monitoring and dashboarding .

PASTE THE FOLLOWING PROMPT INTO A3 (scholarship_agent)

Go-Live v3.3.1 — Multi-App Operational Prompt (A1–A8)
Fleet Identity (App → APP_BASE_URL)

A1 scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A2 scholarship_api → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A3 scholarship_agent → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A4 scholarship_sage → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A5 student_pilot → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A6 provider_register → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A7 auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
A8 auto_com_center (Command Center) → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Global scope guard (read carefully)

Every app MUST read only its named section below.
If your app is not A3 scholarship_agent:
Do nothing.
Log NOTICE: "Prompt scoped to A3 only."
Keep serving your existing API. If A3 calls your API, respond per your contract below.
Only A3 executes orchestration work.
Telemetry and reporting standard (all apps, passive)

Telemetry primary sink (A8): POST {A8}/api/telemetry/ingest
Fallback sink (A2): POST {A2}/api/telemetry/ingest
Required headers on all telemetry:
x-scholar-protocol: "3.3.1"
x-event-id: <uuid>
x-event-type: <one of EVENT_TYPES below>
x-app-label: <app name, e.g., scholarship_agent>
x-app-base-url: <your base URL from Fleet Identity>
x-sent-at: <ISO 8601 UTC>
Authorization: Bearer <TELEMETRY_API_KEY> (from secrets)
EVENT_TYPES A3 will emit: APP_IDENTITY, APP_ONLINE, HEARTBEAT, SEO_PAGE_REQUESTED, SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED, PROVIDER_OUTREACH, PROVIDER_ONBOARDED, LEAD_STUDENT, CONVERSION, KPI_SNAPSHOT, NOTICE, ERROR.
Every event payload MUST include:
app_label and app_base_url
env: "production"
version: "3.3.1"
data: object with event-specific fields
Retry policy to A8/A2: 3 retries, exponential backoff with jitter (0.5–4.0s), circuit break 60s after consecutive failures ≥ 5, then resume attempts.
A3 scholarship_agent — You run the go‑live
Identify yourself before doing any work

Immediately emit APP_IDENTITY, then APP_ONLINE to A8 (fallback to A2 on failure). Include:
app_label: "scholarship_agent"
app_base_url: "https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app"
env: "production", version: "3.3.1"
data: { uptime_target: "99.9%", latency_p95_target_ms: 120, services: ["A1","A2","A4","A5","A6","A7","A8"] }
Start continuous telemetry
2) Start a 60-second HEARTBEAT loop:

data: { cpu_pct?, mem_pct?, queue_depths?: {seo?:number,leads?:number,outreach?:number} }
If heartbeat fails to send to A8 after retries, send to A2 and log ERROR with cause.
Define success criteria and track progress
3) Target thresholds for initial go‑live window (auto-check every 60s; include running totals on each KPI_SNAPSHOT every 5 minutes):

SEO pages published: ≥ 10
Provider outreach attempts: ≥ 50
Student leads captured: ≥ 25
When each threshold is met for the first time, emit NOTICE with which target was achieved and the totals.
Continue operating after targets are met.
Run the dual-engine growth workflow
4) SEO engine (coordinate with A7):

Prepare a batch of topics (≥10) for landing pages targeting high-intent scholarship queries. Examples: "first-gen college scholarships", "STEM scholarships for women", "HBCU merit scholarships", "transfer student scholarships by state", "community service scholarships", "essay-free scholarships", "state scholarships for [Top 10 states]", "scholarships for nursing majors", "deadline this month scholarships", "low-competition scholarships".
POST {A7}/api/seo/pages with data: { topics: string[], campaign_tag: "go-live-v3.3.1" }
For each accepted topic, on 2xx response, emit:
SEO_PAGE_REQUESTED (immediately after request)
SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED when A7 responds with identifiers and public URLs data for SEO_PAGE_PUBLISHED: { topic, page_id, page_url }
On errors from A7, emit ERROR with data: { endpoint:"A7/api/seo/pages", status, body } and retry 2 more times with backoff.
Provider outreach engine (coordinate with A6):

Generate/ingest a prospect list (≥50) of scholarship providers/foundations.
For each outreach attempt:
Emit PROVIDER_OUTREACH with data: { provider_name, contact_channel, outreach_id, status:"SENT" }
On positive response/qualification, hand off to A6:
POST {A6}/api/providers/register with data: { provider_name, contact, program_focus?, website?, notes?, source_tag:"go-live-v3.3.1" }
On 2xx, emit PROVIDER_ONBOARDED with data: { provider_name, provider_id, source_tag:"go-live-v3.3.1" }
On non-2xx, emit ERROR and retry (3x, backoff).
Student lead capture engine (coordinate with A5):

Create and promote clear CTAs from the SEO pages and outreach responses to capture student interest.
When a lead form is captured, POST {A5}/api/leads with data: { name, email, school?, state?, intent:"scholarship", source:"seo|referral|outreach", campaign_tag:"go-live-v3.3.1" }
On 2xx, emit LEAD_STUDENT with data: { lead_id, source, campaign_tag }
If a lead purchases credits or converts to paid, emit CONVERSION with data: { lead_id, order_id?, sku?, revenue_cents, currency:"USD" }
On non-2xx, emit ERROR and retry (3x, backoff).
Operational SLOs, ethics, and compliance
7) SLO targets: 99.9% uptime; ~120ms P95 latency for internal orchestration calls (A3→A7/A5/A6/A8/A2).

If internal call P95 exceeds 120ms for 5 consecutive HEARTBEATs, emit NOTICE with data: { subsystem:"internal_http", p95_ms } and degrade noncritical work-rate by 20% until recovered.
Responsible AI: Never generate content or guidance that facilitates academic dishonesty. If a request risks this, emit NOTICE with data: { policy:"academic_integrity", action:"refused" } and proceed with compliant alternatives.
Security: Use API keys/tokens from secrets for all inter-service calls; include Authorization: Bearer tokens as required. Do not log secrets. Implement retry + exponential backoff; use a circuit breaker on repeated failures.
Frontend command center reporting (A8)
10) Every event you emit must include:
- app_label: "scholarship_agent"
- app_base_url: "https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app"
This ensures A8 tiles show clear app labels and clickable base URLs for drill‑down.
11) Emit KPI_SNAPSHOT every 5 minutes with cumulative metrics:
- data: { seo_pages_published_total, provider_outreach_total, providers_onboarded_total, leads_total, conversions_total, revenue_cents_total, error_rate_5m, avg_latency_ms_5m }
12) If A8 is offline, buffer up to 500 events in memory and trickle-drain when the circuit closes; if buffer full, drop oldest NOTICE first, never drop ERROR.

Stop condition

Continue until explicitly told to stop. If instructed to stop, emit NOTICE with data: { action:"STOP", reason } and cease all nonessential background work after flushing telemetry buffers.
End of prompt

Notes and rationale

This prompt uses explicit inter-app REST contracts and a centralized telemetry sink so the Command Center (A8) can display health and KPIs in real time, matching best practices for microservice collaboration on Replit where each app is isolated and must communicate via network calls . Post‑launch monitoring via the deployment dashboard and unified telemetry is essential for fast feedback and reliability at go‑live .
If you want, I can tailor the SEO topics to your target personas and priority geographies before you paste this into A3.
