CEO Response — Contingency B Execution, Gates, and ARR Readiness

Acknowledgement

I have reviewed Agent3’s updates across all applications and the Infrastructure Intercept broadcast. Decision posture and timelines are accepted as presented.
Executive Decisions (Authoritative)

Go/No-Go: No-Go on current auth path stands.
Contingency B: Approved. Canonical issuer migrates to https://auth.scholaraiadvisor.com behind Cloudflare.
Gate Window: Nov 10, 00:00–00:15 UTC remains the sole AUTH GREEN TAG decision window.
ARR Timing: B2B earliest Nov 10 01:30–03:00 UTC (if Stripe evidence delivered today and Auth passes the gate); B2C earliest Nov 11 00:00 UTC.
Non-Negotiable Acceptance Criteria (must all pass post-migration)

Performance: P95 ≤120ms for Discovery, JWKS, Authorize, Token; error rate ≤0.1%.
Correctness: Issuer must be exactly https://auth.scholaraiadvisor.com end-to-end; OIDC conformance passes; revocation semantics intact.
Caching: Discovery and JWKS return ETag + Cache-Control: public, max-age=300.
Observability: request_id lineage Cloudflare → origin; 7-day retention, no PII; alerting wired for ≥0.1% error spikes and P95 regression.
Immediate Checkpoints (UTC)

18:00 today — Stripe evidence package (Hard gate). Owner: Finance/Platform Ops. Required: Live key loaded, webhook verified, signed test event 200 OK, dashboard screenshots, server logs. Budget up to $500 for Stripe escalation is pre-approved. If at risk, escalate now.
19:30 today — Replit P1 + Cloudflare provisioning confirmation. Owner: Platform Ops. Required: Replit ticket ID, Cloudflare DNS/SSL/Workers provisioning proof.
21:00 today — RFC-001 posted. Owner: Auth DRI. Note: Reported delivered early at 20:35 UTC. Accepted; thank you. Maintain version control and link in the change record.
Nov 9 Controlled Change and Validation

17:00–19:00 — Config-only issuer updates across all relying parties; no code changes.
20:00–21:00 — Pre-soak on new issuer (≥500 samples per endpoint). Deliver histograms, error tallies, go/no-go by 20:45.
Any criteria breach in pre-soak triggers an immediate “Fail with next-window plan” broadcast via auto_com_center.
Per-Application Executive Posture and Orders

scholar_auth (RED): Proceed with Cloudflare-fronted issuer. Open Replit P1. Publish Discovery and JWKS with cache headers. Capture request_id end-to-end. Rehearse five-minute rollback. Include a staged key rotation rehearsal (kid change) before gate.
scholarship_api (GREEN, frozen): Prepare config-only issuer switch; participate in OIDC conformance; verify 401/5xx handling; produce redacted config diff and latency/error distributions.
scholarship_sage (GREEN, frozen): Config-only issuer switch; validate client_credentials flow; enforce read-only scopes; deliver M2M evidence (latency, tokens with new issuer, scope enforcement) T+30 after GREEN TAG.
student_pilot (GREEN, ready/blocked, frozen): Config-only issuer switch; run full E2E harness post-update; deliver T+30 E2E evidence after GREEN TAG, including mobile/desktop sanity and request_id lineage.
provider_register (AMBER): Stripe evidence due 18:00. If missed, B2B remains blocked regardless of auth outcomes. Prepare a graceful fallback: accept provider registrations to a waitlist without payment capture; surface clear messaging; no broken checkout paths.
scholarship_agent (GREEN, observe-only): Maintain freeze; prep config-only switch; participate in OIDC/E2E validation; continue daily fairness rollups (12:00 UTC) and summaries (12:15 UTC).
auto_page_maker (GREEN, unaffected): Maintain freeze; continue 06:00 UTC KPI rollups; no auth dependency. Keep SEO cadence steady; do not alter publishing logic during auth change window.
auto_com_center (GREEN): Infrastructure Intercept broadcast acknowledged. Hold pass/fail variants for Nov 9 pre-soak outcome. Add deliverability guardrails: run DKIM/SPF/DMARC verification checks, seed-inbox tests across major providers, target ≥99% accepted and ≥95% inbox placement on transactional mail. SMS remains opt-in only; confirm STOP/HELP compliance and per-country rate limits before any broad SMS use.
Risk Register and Mitigations

OIDC Discovery interception upstream of app: Mitigated by Cloudflare Workers termination and canonical issuer. Replit P1 opened; track vendor SLA.
DNS/propagation risk: Pre-provision low-TTL records; validate from multiple regions before pre-soak.
Stripe evidence risk (time-bound): CFO + Stripe Priority Support engaged if any blocker; budget pre-approved.
Deliverability risk on broadcast variants: Run seed tests before sending PASS/FAIL variants; throttle by domain if needed.
Regression risk post-migration: Five-minute rollback plan staged; snapshot configs before change window.
KPIs to Report at Each Checkpoint

Auth: P50/P95 per endpoint, error rate, issuer correctness proof, cache headers, request_id lineage samples.
B2B Stripe: Webhook verification logs, signed event 200 OK, first-authorized charge test in live mode (for $0 or minimal authorized-and-voided flow if policy permits).
B2C/B2B readiness: Relying-party config diffs (redacted), OIDC conformance results.
Auto Page Maker: Daily indexation, CWV p75, error rate, P95.
Financial and Strategic Alignment

We accept a 24-hour slip to protect trust, security, and long-term scalability toward the $10M profitable ARR target.
Organic growth engine (auto_page_maker) continues compounding and preserves low CAC during the auth stabilization.
No relaxation of security posture, revocation semantics, or compliance (FERPA/COPPA). No temporary bypasses.
What I Need Next

18:00 UTC: Stripe evidence package delivered to me and logged in the evidence folder. If at risk, notify within 10 minutes of this message and escalate.
19:30 UTC: Replit ticket ID and Cloudflare provisioning proof posted.
21:00 UTC: Confirm RFC-001 final link and hash (already reported early); record it in the change log with owners.
Final Word
Guard the gate. Quality over speed. No compromises on issuer correctness, security, or performance. ARR ignition follows stability, not precedes it. Proceed.
