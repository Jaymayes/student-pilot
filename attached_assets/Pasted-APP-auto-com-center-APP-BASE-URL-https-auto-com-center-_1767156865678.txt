Acknowledged your “Search & Destroy” diagnostic. Because concierge emails are already live, we must treat this as a live incident while preserving conversion. Here’s the exact, low-risk decision flow to reconcile the screenshots with real-time status.

Immediate 2-path plan (do A and B in order)

A) Verify live health (1–2 minutes, no code changes)

Incognito tests (stale cookie eliminator)
A6: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/auth/login
Expected: 302 → A1 /oidc/auth with PKCE S256 → consent/authorize page
FAIL: “server_error … Failed to process interaction”
A5: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app → Login
Expected: 302 → A1 /oidc/auth with PKCE S256
FAIL: same server_error
OIDC endpoints
https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/openid-configuration → 200
https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/jwks.json → 200
If both 200 and Incognito fails at “interaction/confirm” → “Zombie” (container up, DB session lost)
B) If any Incognito flow fails → Hard restart A1 now (Stop → wait 10s → Start in Replit)

After restart:
Re-run the two Incognito logins (A6 then A5)
Acceptance criteria to resume outreach monitoring:
A6 and A5 both 302 to A1 with PKCE → consent page OK (no server_error)
A1 discovery/JWKS return 200 within <150ms p95 (post-cache warm)
Why this order

We already verified (earlier) that A1 discovery/JWKS were green; the error may be stale session/cookies or an intermittent “interaction/confirm” handler failure. Incognito confirms whether it’s an active outage vs. the “zombie” state.
Restart only if Incognito still fails; otherwise we keep the platform stable during the outreach window.
Risk-managed communications while we verify (do this only if a provider replies before the restart finishes)

Paste this short reply (same email thread) if they report an error:
“Thanks for the quick response. If you see an error screen, please try again in a private/incognito window. We just refreshed our login service and it should work now. If you’d like, I can stay on a 10–15 minute call while you complete the Stripe screen (~5 minutes).”
If a link expired (Stripe): generate fresh link in A6 and reply with the new link only to that provider.
What I’m watching in A8 (no noise until a trigger)

provider_connected (success) → I’ll ping immediately
stripe_connect_link_regenerated (rescue used) → I’ll watch for follow‑through provider_connected
No provider_connected by T+24h → page
No listing_created by T+72h → ticket
A7 sitemap health: confirm batch growth; alert only on non‑200 or regression
Optional: “Proceed”/“Hold” decision shortcuts

If your Incognito test just passed (both A6→A1 and A5→A1), say “Auth Verified” and we continue watch mode—do not resend emails.
If it failed and you’ve restarted A1, say “Auth Restarted” and I’ll run end‑to‑end verification again, then continue watch mode.
Bottom line

We do not send more emails.
We verify Incognito now; if failure, restart A1 once; then resume monitoring for provider_connected.
I’ll remain silent unless one of the triggers fires or you confirm “Auth Restarted” for a quick re‑verification.
