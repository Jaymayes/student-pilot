CEO Command Memo — Operation Synergy
From: CEO, Scholar AI Advisor
Time: Now (T+0 reference)

Executive Summary

Gate A (Auth → Provider → B2B enablement): GO now. Order A is complete; provider_register must execute Order B immediately and deliver evidence at T+40. Student_pilot to launch Phase 1 monetization (10% traffic) within 5 minutes of provider_register = GO.
Gate B (Comms Infrastructure → DRY-RUN → Full FOC): Conditional GO. Comms Infrastructure Team must deliver GREEN by T+60. auto_com_center and scholarship_agent will launch DRY-RUN at T+65 only upon GREEN. No fan-out to production until CEO PASS at T+225.
Freeze discipline remains in effect. No schema/API changes; configuration-only as planned.
Decisions and Orders

Gate A — Provider Register, Student Pilot, Scholarship API
Decision: GO.
Provider_register (Order B owner):
Execute PKCE S256 verification and B2B smoke test now.
Deliver the 6-artifact evidence bundle + SHA256 manifest by T+40.
Negative tests must return 401/403 with standardized errors and request_id.
Scholarship_api:
Stay on-call; enforce SSOT, RBAC, standardized errors. Support request_id correlation for all Order B calls.
Scholar_auth:
Stand by for rapid support (<2 min). Ensure JWKS and token rotation remain stable.
Student_pilot (Order E):
Upon CEO GO on provider_register (expected T+40), enable Phase 1 (10% live Stripe) within 5 minutes.
Maintain guardrails and auto-rollback as specified (payment success ≥98.5%, 5xx <0.2%, auth ≥99.5%, CVR ±10% of baseline).
2. Gate B — Comms Infrastructure, Auto Com Center, Scholarship Agent

Decision: Conditional GO.
Comms Infrastructure Team (Order C owner):
Deliver GREEN by T+60. Heap pressure must remain ≤85% (target ≤75% sustained for 10 minutes), error rate <0.1%, DLQ=0, GC P95 <100ms.
Provide evidence: heap profile, GC metrics, queue depth, consumer lag, and time-series error/latency.
Capital authorization: Approved to scale memory/class size or switch to GC configuration that meets targets. Budget OK to achieve GREEN within SLA.
Auto_com_center (Order D co-owner):
Status acknowledged: YELLOW due to infrastructure RED. Hold position. Launch DRY-RUN at T+65 only after GREEN.
Pass criteria remain as defined: P95 ≤120ms, failures <0.1%, DLQ=0, opt-out <5s, standardized errors, circuit breakers closed.
Abort if any threshold breaches as stated.
Scholarship_agent (Order D co-owner):
Ready to generate 30,000 msgs @ 500/min for 120 minutes with request_id correlation.
Deliver the 10-artifact evidence bundle + SHA256 by T+215.
3. Contingencies and Escalations

If Order C misses T+60 GREEN:
Immediate SEV-1 escalation to Comms Infrastructure Team. No DRY-RUN launch. Re-baseline to T+60+30 once GREEN achieved. Do not alter DRY-RUN parameters or break freeze.
B2C Phase 1 (10%) continues; Phase 2/3 remain locked pending DRY-RUN PASS.
If Order D DRY-RUN fails PASS criteria:
Abort to observe-only; root cause and mitigation plan within 60 minutes; reschedule window within 24 hours.
SLO Governance (All Services)

Uptime ≥99.9%; P95 ≤120ms; 5xx <0.1%.
Standardized JSON errors with request_id.
HTTPS/TLS for all inter-service calls.
Central auth via scholar_auth only; enforce RBAC on protected routes.
KPI Cadence and Evidence

Hourly until T+225, then daily:
B2C: visitor→signup, free→paid (target 3–5%), ARPU credits ($8–12), payment success, 5xx error rate, auth success.
B2B: active providers, active listings, platform fee revenue, RBAC enforcement metrics.
Platform: P50/P95 latency, error rate, throughput, queue depth, consumer lag, circuit breaker state changes.
Evidence checkpoints:
T+27: provider_register interim status ping (progress vs. Order B plan).
T+40: provider_register 6-artifact bundle; CEO will issue provider_register = GO upon receipt.
T+60: Comms Infrastructure GREEN evidence.
T+65–T+185: DRY-RUN execution window.
T+215: scholarship_agent and auto_com_center evidence bundles.
T+225: CEO PASS/FAIL; production fan-out authorization.
Lifecycle and Revenue Cessation Planning (deliver or confirm by EOD)

Intelligence/Automation (2–3 years):
scholarship_agent: Q4 2027–Q2 2028 window already acknowledged.
scholarship_sage: Q4 2027–Q2 2028 acknowledged.
auto_page_maker: Q4 2027–Q2 2028 acknowledged.
Infrastructure (5–7 years):
scholar_auth: submit date window + rationale (standards evolution, scale/security horizon).
scholarship_api: submit date window + rationale (SSOT evolution, data model limits).
auto_com_center: submit date window + rationale (protocols, providers, throughput growth).
User-facing (3–4 years):
student_pilot: submit date window + rationale (UX trends, competitive parity).
provider_register: submit date window + rationale (provider workflows, B2B UX norms).
Compliance and Responsible AI

Maintain observe-only marketing posture until DRY-RUN PASS and CEO authorization.
FERPA/COPPA/GDPR and CAN-SPAM: opt-out <5s proof in DRY-RUN evidence; data minimization and purpose binding enforced.
No black box: keep explainability artifacts for scholarship_sage recommendations; retain request_id end-to-end audit trails for 7 years.
Status Acknowledgments (as reported)

scholar_auth: Order A delivered ahead of SLA; credentials live; JWKS operational.
provider_register: 100% ready; awaiting and now in receipt of credentials; proceed with Order B.
scholarship_api: GO; SSOT and RBAC enforced; event emissions ready; P95 ~96ms.
scholarship_sage: GO; P95 ~1ms; observe-only comms posture maintained.
student_pilot: GO for Phase 1 on provider_register = GO; guardrails and rollback verified.
auto_page_maker: GREEN; SEO engine active; freeze discipline maintained; supports low-CAC growth.
scholarship_agent: GO; DRY-RUN co-owner ready; evidence bundle spec confirmed.
auto_com_center: Application GREEN, infra RED; ready to launch DRY-RUN at T+65 upon GREEN.
What I need next

provider_register: Deliver Order B evidence by T+40. Upon receipt, I will issue GO for production usage and authorize student_pilot Phase 1 immediately.
Comms Infrastructure Team: Deliver GREEN + evidence at T+60. This is critical path for Full FOC.
auto_com_center and scholarship_agent: Remain in observe-only; be at T+65 readiness with abort automation armed.
All DRIs: If your lifecycle window is not explicitly stated above, submit your Section 6 analysis with date window, rationale, and contingencies by EOD.
Reaffirmation of Prime Directive

We proceed because this sequencing unlocks B2B fees and Phase 1 B2C monetization while protecting CAC via SEO and minimizing risk with strict guardrails.
No changes to scope or DRY-RUN parameters before FOC; quality and reliability first, velocity second—then scale.
I will issue provider_register = GO immediately upon receiving the T+40 evidence bundle and authorize student_pilot Phase 1 (10%) within five minutes of that GO. Full FOC remains gated on Order C GREEN → Order D PASS → CEO final authorization at T+225.
