Excellent. With all eight apps now published, here’s the CEO-level post-launch plan to lock in revenue, protect SLOs, and accelerate toward our $10M ARR objective.

Decision: GO, with guardrails

We are Go for revenue. All engines are live. Our near-term risk is operational drift (misconfigured live keys, indexing lag, or notification deliverability). We’ll mitigate with the 72-hour Launch Control Plan below.
72-hour Launch Control Plan (single-threaded priority)
Owner placeholders: Growth, Product, Ops/SRE, Finance, Compliance. If you confirm owners, I’ll tailor this to named people.

0–6 hours: Revenue and Reliability Validation

B2B live-fee confirmation (provider_register + Stripe Connect)
Run a $5 live test payment on a real provider Connect account.
Verify platform fee = 3% in Stripe live mode; confirm payout schedule.
Deliverable: Screenshot of live charge, application_fee_amount, and payout schedule.
B2C purchase validation (student_pilot + Stripe)
Complete a live $1 credit purchase end-to-end with a real card and receipt email.
Verify credits ledger posted in scholarship_api and consumed in scholarship_sage flow.
Authentication and token verification (scholar_auth)
Fetch JWKS and validate RS256 tokens from each consuming app; confirm /verify latency <120ms P95.
Notification deliverability (auto_com_center)
Send “Welcome,” “Payment Receipt,” and “New Match Found” to test addresses on Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo.
Confirm inbox placement, DKIM/SPF/DMARC alignment, and click-tracking; remediate any spam placement.
Public SEO surface (auto_page_maker)
Submit sitemap.xml to Google Search Console; confirm ownership, indexing coverage begins.
Quick spot-check: 10 random pages load <120ms P95; canonical and scholarship JSON-LD present.
6–24 hours: Data Quality and UX Readiness

Scholarship data checks (scholarship_api)
Top 100 pages: verify title, deadlines, amount, eligibility, and outbound links are valid; remove/flag rot.
Add soft validation for missing fields; escalate to provider or suppress from SEO if below quality threshold.
Application Tracker UX (student_pilot)
Verify profile completion nudges operate and correlate with match-score improvements; set target profile completion ≥60% for new signups within 48h.
AI guidance boundaries (scholarship_sage)
Red-team “no ghostwriting” guardrails; ensure outputs are outlines/checklists/tips only.
Add telemetry tag for “guidance_only_enforced=true” on all responses.
24–72 hours: Growth Engine and Observability

SEO indexing momentum
Track pages discovered, indexed, and average position; first goal: 10–20% sitemap URLs indexed by Day 7.
Publish 200–500 incremental pages/day (high-value scholarships + long-tail categories). Avoid crawl spikes; keep a steady cadence.
Matching and retention (scholarship_agent)
Nightly cron verifies new students matched; target “match notification rate” ≥30% of new profiles within 24h.
Monitor scraper failure isolation; error budget burn must stay within SLO.
End-to-end dashboards (Ops/SRE + Finance)
Ship unified dashboards for: uptime, latency P50/P95/P99, error rate, signups, ARPU, provider fee revenue, cash reconciliation.
Daily executive summary posted 9am local with prior day’s KPIs and deviations.
Core KPIs to track daily (with initial targets)

B2C funnel (Auto Page Maker → Student Pilot)
Visits (organic): baseline from GSC; target +15% WoW after first index.
Visit-to-signup: 8–12% target.
Profile completion ≥60% within 48h of signup.
Credit purchase rate (first 7 days): 12–18% of active users.
B2C ARPU (monthly): initial $12–$20 via credits; target 4x AI markup preserved.
B2B funnel (Provider Register)
New providers onboarded/week: 15–25 initial, 40+ by Month 2.
% providers Stripe Connect live: ≥80% within 24h of signup.
Active postings/provider MoM: ≥2.0.
Platform fee revenue: 3% of provider tx; target $5–$10k/month by end of Q1.
System SLOs (all apps)
Uptime ≥99.9%.
P95 latency ≤120ms.
Error rate <0.5%.
Notification deliverability: Inbox placement ≥95% for transactional emails.
30-day plan to hit first revenue milestones

Traffic and indexing
Submit sitemap; maintain steady publishing cadence.
Launch 10 “hub” pages for high-intent categories; internal linking to long-tail pages.
Target: 25–40% of pages indexed; 3–5k daily visits by Day 30.
Pricing and packaging
Keep 4x AI service markup; start with 3–4 credit bundles (e.g., $9, $19, $49, $99).
A/B test: “Get Matched” vs “Apply Faster” CTA copy on top 50 pages.
Optimize refunds and fairness policy to protect margins and trust.
Provider revenue scale
Outbound: 100 provider outreach/wk; 20% demo conversion; 50% post-demo conversion to live postings.
Launch a limited early-adopter offer: fee cap for first 60 days if they list ≥3 scholarships.
Trust and compliance
Reconfirm COPPA/FERPA guardrails; enforce age gating and parental consent if required.
Update privacy policy to explicitly state use of AI for advisory guidance (no ghostwriting).
Financial discipline
Maintain low CAC via SEO; cap paid acquisition experiments at <$1k test budget.
Approve spend only where LTV:CAC ≥ 3:1 in <90 days.
Operating guardrails and runbooks

Error budget policy
If any app consumes >30% of monthly error budget within a week, initiate release freeze on that app, run a fix-forward plan, and conduct a blameless postmortem.
Incident response
On-call rotation; 15-minute acknowledgement SLA; comms via auto_com_center templates.
Security posture
JWT RS256 across services; least-privilege scopes; rotate keys every 90 days.
Stripe webhook signatures verified; Postmark/Twilio credentials protected; secrets scanned weekly.
Immediate asks to the team (confirm back “done” with evidence)

Finance
Switch Stripe to live mode for both B2C and B2B; run $5 live tests for each flow; post screenshots and Stripe IDs.
Set up daily Stripe → accounting reconciliation; confirm platform fee payouts visible.
Ops/SRE
Provision dashboards: uptime, latency, error rate, queue depths, and email deliverability; share public links or screenshots.
Confirm all healthz/readyz endpoints are green and alerting is wired to on-call.
Growth
Submit sitemap to Google Search Console; verify ownership; share coverage report link.
Publish 200–500 incremental pages in the next 24h; share a list of new slugs and a Lighthouse sample.
Product
Deliver Application Tracker nudge experiments (copy variants x2); share expected uplift hypothesis and success metric.
Define “student value moments” telemetry: time-to-first-match, time-to-first-application, first guidance request; instrument events.
Compliance
Re-review privacy policy and TOS for minors and international users; confirm COPPA/FERPA alignment; update as needed; report changes.
Revenue trajectory checkpoints

Week 1: Confirm live revenue in both engines; ≥$1k GMV processed; fee capture verified.
Week 2: 1.5–2.5k daily organic visits; 300–500 new signups/week; ≥50 providers onboarded cumulative; net revenue run-rate ≥$3–5k/month.
Week 4: 3–5k daily visits; ≥1k new signups/week; 100+ providers live; run-rate ≥$8–12k/month.
Offer
If you want, I’ll orchestrate a 90-minute “Go-Live Drill” now: we’ll run the live transactions, verify deliverability, submit sitemaps, and stand up the executive dashboards. Confirm the owners for Growth, Product, Ops/SRE, Finance, and Compliance, or grant me temporary authority to assign them.
