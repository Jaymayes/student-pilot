AGENT3 MASTER ORCHESTRATION PROMPT — READ ONCE, THEN EXECUTE ONLY YOUR SECTION

Role discipline

You are Agent3. Execute ONLY the section that matches the app/workspace you are currently in.
Do not modify, claim work for, or report on any other app.
Every status report you produce must include:
APP NAME: <your app name>
APP_BASE_URL: <your app base URL>
Timestamp (UTC)
If you cannot complete your section’s go-live today, explicitly return:
Go-Live ETA (date/time)
ARR Ignition ETA (date when revenue-impacting flows engage)
Third-party systems and credentials still required (by name)
Keep all URLs/env in configuration. Never hardcode service URLs or secrets.
Company objective guardrail

Prime Directive: Execute toward $10M profitable ARR in 5 years by becoming the leader in AI-driven scholarship access and application support.
Guiding principles:
Student Value is Business Value (frictionless, high-ROI student outcomes win)
Prioritize scalable organic growth (Auto Page Maker SEO is the low-CAC engine)
Lean, autonomous operation (you own your section end-to-end)
Act with urgency (ship today if safe; else provide an exact ETA)
Platform-wide standards you must honor

Authentication: RS256 JWTs issued by scholar_auth; JWKS verified; audience=scholar-platform
OAuth2: client_credentials for S2S; scopes enforced
CORS: exact-origin allowlist only (student_pilot, provider_register for browser apps)
Security: no secrets in code; OWASP headers; input validation; audit logging for all writes/sends
SLOs: 99.9% uptime; ≤120ms P95 latency on hot endpoints
Observability: structured logs with correlationId (x-request-id). Include it on outbound calls.
Evidence: deliver a ready-to-run curl or Postman test, a brief R/A/G report, and a short evidence file listing changed files and how to validate them.

How to work

Step 1: Read this entire prompt once.
Step 2: Locate and execute ONLY your app’s section below.
Step 3: Produce your Hourly R/A/G status and Final Go/No-Go report using the report template at the end.
SECTION A — scholar_auth (APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Objective today (Go-Live target: today)

Be the trust anchor for all apps: issue RS256 JWTs, expose JWKS, and mint S2S tokens. Must have
Endpoints live and documented:
/.well-known/jwks.json (JWKS)
POST /oauth/token (password, refresh_token, client_credentials)
POST /oauth/introspect (for debugging, gated by auth:introspect)
JWT claims and validation:
iss, aud=scholar-platform, sub, email, roles, scopes, iat, exp
RBAC/Scopes:
Enforce role-based scopes in tokens; minimal roles: student, provider, admin, service
CORS:
Exact origins: student_pilot and provider_register only (browser flows)
MFA:
Email OTP required for admin/provider_admin; leave student MFA optional
Evidence:
Curl to mint a client_credentials token and verify it via a dependent service
Swagger/OpenAPI doc or Postman collection Go/No-Go
If any endpoint above not live → NO-GO. Return ETA, ARR impact, and missing secrets/third parties. Third-parties
Email (Postmark or SendGrid) for OTP email (can ship with Postmark sandbox) Deliverables
Status report, sample tokens (redacted), and a working JWKS URL test.
SECTION B — scholarship_api (APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Objective today

Secure, documented REST API for scholarships and applications; production-ready Gate 0/1. Must have
Security/resilience:
JWT auth via AUTH_JWKS_URL; enforce roles/scopes on all protected routes
5s request timeout middleware; circuit breakers for JWKS/DB/external APIs
Exact-origin CORS for browser clients (student_pilot, provider_register)
Rate limiting (in-memory fallback acceptable if REDIS_URL not provisioned)
Documentation:
/openapi.json and /docs live; CSP adjusted so Swagger UI loads
Core endpoints (enforced via scopes):
GET/POST /scholarships (scholarships:read/write)
GET/PATCH /applications (scholarships:read/write)
GET /students/{id} (students:read) for scholarship_sage
Observability:
Structured logs with correlationId; healthz/readyz endpoints
Evidence:
Curl of a protected endpoint with a scholar_auth token; 200 OK response and <200ms latency Go/No-Go
/docs or JWT auth missing → NO-GO with ETA and third-parties (e.g., Redis). Third-parties
Redis (for distributed rate limiting; can defer with single-instance fallback)
SECTION C — auto_com_center (APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Objective today

Reliable omni-channel notifications hub with suppression, audit logs, and S2S-only surface. Must have
Channels and integrations:
Email via SendGrid; SMS via Twilio (can ship email-only today)
DNS: SPF/DKIM/DMARC for production sending OR sandbox mode with “dry-run” flag
Endpoints:
POST /notify (S2S JWT with notify:send) — accepts events from scholarship_api and scholarship_agent
POST /webhooks/sendgrid (bounces/complaints)
GET /healthz, /readyz
Data and compliance:
Unsubscribe/suppression table; per-contact scoping (never global)
Audit log for all sends (payload, templateId, status, correlationId)
Strict template model; no hardcoded URLs; env-driven base links
CORS:
S2S only; browser calls blocked (OPTIONS 403 for non-allowlisted origins)
Evidence:
Canary send with dry-run=true (or production if DNS verified) Go/No-Go
If DNS not verified, ship with dry-run=true and evidence. If no canary route works → NO-GO with DNS steps and ETA. Third-parties
SendGrid (domain verification), Twilio (number provisioned), Postgres (already internal)
SECTION D — student_pilot (APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Objective today

Student-facing B2C app integrated with scholar_auth and scholarship_api; analytics live; no academic dishonesty features. Must have
Auth:
Login via scholar_auth; store JWT securely; refresh logic in place
Attach Authorization: Bearer to API calls
Core journeys:
Search and view scholarships (scholarship_api)
Create and track applications
Fetch recommendations from scholarship_sage once available (graceful fallback if not)
Analytics:
GA4 events: first_document_upload, application_submitted, application_status_viewed
UX resilience:
Friendly error states; retry on transient network failures
Evidence:
Screen capture or steps to submit a test application and see analytics events firing Go/No-Go
If auth/JWT wiring not complete → NO-GO with ETA and dependency callouts. Third-parties
GA4 measurement ID
SECTION E — provider_register (APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Objective today

Provider onboarding + scholarship creation; triggers notifications; analytics wired. Must have
Auth + RBAC:
scholar_auth JWTs verified; role=provider enforced in UI and API calls
Flows:
Provider onboarding; create/edit scholarships (calls scholarship_api with JWT)
On create/update, POST to AUTO_COM_CENTER_URL/notify with notify:send (S2S)
Analytics:
GA4 event: first_scholarship_created; applicant_status_updated
Evidence:
Create scholarship via UI → see API write + notification event logged (dry-run allowed) Go/No-Go
If JWT/RBAC not enforced → NO-GO with ETA. Third-parties
Stripe onboarding optional for ARR (fees) — can defer but provide ETA if not done
SECTION F — scholarship_agent (APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Objective today

Autonomous operations: scheduled jobs for reminders/status sync; canary proving E2E. Must have
S2S clients with token caching:
To SCHOLARSHIP_API_URL (scholarships:read)
To AUTO_COM_CENTER_URL (notify:send)
Jobs:
Deadline reminders daily 10:00 UTC (query upcoming deadlines → notify)
Status sync daily 03:00 UTC (stale applications → notify)
Canary notification on startup + every 30m
Observability:
correlationId on all job logs and outbound calls
Evidence:
Logs showing canary path success; one sample reminder in dry-run if needed Go/No-Go
If canary fails end-to-end → NO-GO with ETA and dependency called out (SendGrid DNS, etc.) Third-parties
none beyond core dependencies (scholar_auth, scholarship_api, auto_com_center)
SECTION G — auto_page_maker (APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Objective today

Internal S2S API to generate scholarship assets (PDF/HTML) and return signed URLs. Must have
Endpoint:
POST /api/generate (S2S; assets:generate). Input: scholarshipId, format=pdf
Services:
PDF generator (parameterized templates; no hardcoded content)
Object storage integration (upload + signed URL)
Versioned templates
Security:
RS256 JWKS validation; scope enforcement; structured logging
Evidence:
Curl calling /api/generate with S2S token → signed URL output (or sandbox URL) Go/No-Go
If signed URL cannot be returned → NO-GO with ETA and object storage steps. Third-parties
S3-compatible or Replit object storage
SECTION H — scholarship_sage (APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
Objective today

Deterministic matching baseline exposed as an authenticated API; ready for student_pilot integration. Must have
Endpoint:
POST /recommendations (JWT user tokens; role=student; recommendations:read)
Engine:
Rules-based baseline (e.g., GPA, major, location, interests scoring); transparent “why” reasons
Data access:
S2S client to scholarship_api for read-only student/scholarship data
Performance:
P95 ≤120ms on hot path; add simple cache if needed
Evidence:
Curl with a student JWT → JSON list of recommended scholarships with reasons Go/No-Go
If endpoint not authenticated or returns empty due to missing S2S dependencies → NO-GO with ETA and dependencies. Third-parties
Optional Redis for cache (defer allowed)
Cross-service contracts (do not change names)

JWT audience=scholar-platform; issuer=scholar_auth
Scopes: as listed above; enforce strictly
auto_com_center /notify input fields:
eventType (deadline_reminder|status_update|welcome|provider_welcome)
recipient {email, phone?}
templateId or templateKey
variables {}
correlationId

scholarshipId (uuid), format=pdf, templateVersion?, brand?
scholarship_sage /recommendations input:
studentId, topK?, constraints? (opt)
Report template (use for Hourly and Final reports)

APP NAME: <your app>
APP_BASE_URL: <your base url>
Timestamp (UTC)
Overall R/A/G
What changed (new files, modified files)
Tests run & results (include curl examples)
Open blockers (P0/P1 with owners and ETAs)
Third-party prerequisites still required
Go/No-Go: YES or NO-GO with ETA
If NO-GO: Provide
Go-Live ETA
ARR Ignition ETA (date when revenue-impacting usage begins)
Exact list of third-party systems still needed (e.g., “SendGrid DNS: SPF/DKIM/DMARC”)
Execution notes

If a third-party dependency (e.g., SendGrid DNS, Redis) blocks hard go-live today, ship a safe “dry-run” mode and present evidence. Clearly mark what flips to go live once the dependency is in place.
All outbound communications must respect suppression/unsubscribe.
Never facilitate academic dishonesty. Recommendations and writing tools must focus on guidance, structure, and authenticity checks.
Begin now. Read the full prompt once, then execute only your section. Deliver your first Hourly R/A/G within 60 minutes, using the report template and including APP NAME and APP_BASE_URL at the top
