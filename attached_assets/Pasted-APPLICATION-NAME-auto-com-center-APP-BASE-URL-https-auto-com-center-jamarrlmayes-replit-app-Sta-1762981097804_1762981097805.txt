APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Observer mode; internal canary only)

Summary

Gate A decision acknowledged: NO-GO for production until scale criteria pass.
30K webhook replay delivered 100% with perfect idempotency/ordering but failed latency SLO (P95 ≈ 895ms vs ≤120ms target).
All rate-limiting blockers cleared (global, origin, abuse-monitor exemptions applied for /webhooks).
Compliance posture intact; remain in observer mode pending latency remediation and re-test.
Evidence (current)

Diagnostic 1K replay: 100% acceptance after limiter fixes; P95 improved vs earlier runs but still degrades under sustained load.
30K replay: 30,000/30,000 accepted, 0 idempotency violations, 0 ordering violations; P95 ≈ 895ms.
Post-mortem prepared with root-cause hypotheses and mitigation plan; evidence bundle includes logs, metrics, and SHA-256 manifests (internal path shared by Agent3; upload to central evidence portal is required for audit).
Blockers (Section IV gaps preventing GO-LIVE)

Performance SLO: P95 ack latency ≤120ms under 30K load not met.
Evidence gaps (to be closed for production): finalized latency histograms, error-budget ledger, RBAC test matrix for admin endpoints, and immutable audit-log lineage across producer → consumer → persistence for the 30K run.
Immediate CEO Directives

DRI assignment: Agent3 is the DRI for auto_com_center Gate A until PASS. Maintain observer mode; no external sends.
Repository access: Platform Ops grant Agent3 Editor access to the Replit project “auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes” within 15 minutes. Provision a service account API token for CI, and ensure Replit Secrets are populated (WEBHOOK_BEARER_KEY, DB_URL, REDIS_URL, SENTRY_DSN). Confirm via audit log.
Evidence handling: Move the evidence_root artifacts to the central evidence endpoint and register checksums; link back here once published.
Mitigation Plan (to hit P95 ≤120ms by 02:00 UTC re-test)

Ingestion path
Enforce 202-then-queue pattern: ensure the HTTP handler only authenticates, performs constant-time HMAC check, writes to an in-memory or Redis-backed queue, and returns immediately.
Remove any synchronous DB writes from the request path.
Persistence layer
Implement batched writes (10–50 events/txn) with prepared statements.
Ensure covering index on (messageId, eventType), verify pool size and max in-flight; raise connection pool limits within DB quotas.
Add a lightweight idempotency store (Redis SET or HASH) for O(1) duplicate checks; keep DB unique constraint as a safety net only.
Concurrency and backpressure
Increase worker concurrency with bounded queues; autoscale consumers to keep P95 below target.
Confirm retry with jitter and DLQ do not synchronously block the ack path.
Observability and guardrails
Collect P50/P95/P99 latency histograms at receiver and consumer.
Emit request_id lineage from ingress → queue → consumer → DB commit.
Retest Plan and Deadlines

22:00 UTC: Post-mortem review complete; mitigation owners and rollout steps confirmed (Agent3 DRI; Platform Ops for infra).
00:30–01:30 UTC: Deploy mitigation (queue-first + batch writes + pool tuning), smoke test with 1K synthetic batch (must show P95 ≤120ms).
02:00 UTC: Full 30K replay. PASS criteria: ≥99.9% accepted, P95 ≤120ms, 0 idempotency violations, 0 ordering violations, complete evidence bundle.
If PASS at 02:00 UTC: submit GO recommendation for Gate A with rollback plan; production enablement window begins 13 Nov.
ARR impact and forecast

B2C engine: On track if Gate A passes by 02:00 UTC and Legal unblocks student_pilot; Nov 13–15 ignition window remains achievable.
B2B engine: Unchanged; provider_register retest Nov 13.
Organic growth: auto_page_maker canary remains GO at 22:15 UTC with strict CWV guardrails.
Third-Party Dependencies and Status

Redis/BullMQ (queue and idempotency store): Required; ensure capacity and persistence configured.
PostgreSQL/Neon (event store): Required; indexes and pool limits must be verified and tuned.
Cloud runtime/load balancer (Replit/Edge/CNAME): Required; confirm health checks and autoscaling policies.
Sentry/Logging backend: Required for telemetry and audit immutability.
Email provider (for webhook provenance/HMAC): Continue using verified HMAC; no changes to sender required.
Estimated Go-Live Date

If 02:00 UTC replay passes: Promote to limited production traffic by 13 Nov 16:00 UTC with guardrails. Full production by 14–15 Nov pending stability review.
ARR Ignition

Earliest contribution: Nov 13–15 window (post Gate A PASS and Legal clearance dependencies).
Requests for CEO/Leadership

Confirm that Agent3 retains exclusive DRI authority for Gate A until PASS (recommended).
Approve temporary infra headroom (DB pool, Redis capacity) for the 30K replay window.
Require Gate C (scholar_auth) DRI to deliver MFA/SSO, token lifecycle, RBAC, and audit evidence for internal/UAT by the next checkpoint; any auth anomaly triggers automatic rollback.
Next update

I will report at 22:00 UTC with mitigation deployment status and at 02:00 UTC with the final PASS/FAIL evidence for the 30K replay.
