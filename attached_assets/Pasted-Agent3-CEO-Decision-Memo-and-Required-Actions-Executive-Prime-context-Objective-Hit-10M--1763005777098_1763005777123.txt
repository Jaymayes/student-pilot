Agent3 — CEO Decision Memo and Required Actions (Executive)

Prime context

Objective: Hit $10M profitable ARR in 5 years while leading AI-driven scholarship access and application support. Decisions are data-first and must improve B2C/B2B funnel economics with low CAC, 4x AI markup, and 3% provider fee profitability.
Go-live gates: 99.9% uptime SLO, ≤120ms P95 latency targets by app tier, RBAC + MFA/SSO, TLS 1.3, auditability, DR tested, ecosystem integration, and Responsible AI standards.
Immediate issues
Your updates contain contradictory claims across multiple workspaces (e.g., provider_register simultaneously “Delayed” and “Unconditional Go-Live Approved”). As CEO, I will not accept any go-live claim without verifiable evidence. Replit’s publish model enforces a clear separation between workspaces and live deployments; assertions must be backed by published evidence from the correct app and environment, not workspace-only observations . Security and auth claims must meet modern standards (TLS 1.3, robust key/session controls, MFA/SSO) with auditable proof before traffic is allowed . These gates align with our Playbook’s operating discipline and KPI model for scaling ARR efficiently and safely .

Your assignment — confirm now (blocking)

Post in this thread within 15 minutes:
The application(s) you own.
The exact workspace(s) you have access to.
For each app: the current published APP_BASE_URL and whether the live instance has been re-published after your latest changes (per Replit’s snapshot model) .
Provisional go/no-go decisions (until evidence is verified)
For each app below, respond with a Status Package using the required header and evidence list. No exceptions.

APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Provisional status: DELAYED pending independent retest and audit-log fixes.
Conditions to clear today:
Performance: Mixed and Read P95 ≤180ms in a one-hour test window, error rate <1%. Post raw test artifacts (.jtl/.json, charts) and logs. If met, cap at 100 concurrent providers, with auto-rollback if P95 >250ms for 10 minutes or error rate >1% for 5 minutes. Then re-baseline to ≤120ms P95 within 7 days.
Audit logs: Fix router guard, enforce API client pattern, and correct SQL cursor handling. Post code diff and security review notes. Security and audit controls must match our authentication and logging requirements before GA traffic is enabled .
Re-publish confirmation: Confirm publish timestamp and config snapshot ID per Replit’s publishing workflow .
Evidence required: health endpoint, metrics dashboard screenshots, k6/Gatling outputs, DB index plan, DR test proof (RTO/RPO).
APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth

OIDC endpoints live and reachable: /.well-known/openid-configuration, /jwks.json.
MFA/SSO flows demonstrated; RBAC with ADMIN_EMAILS; TLS 1.3 enforced; keys/secrets management documented; session/JWT rotation policy and revocation flows per secure session guidelines .
DR test proof (backup/restore), monitoring/alerts configured.
Provide a signed evidence bundle and confirm published snapshot details (not workspace-only) .
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Provisional status: DELAYED, Private Beta only.
Conditions to clear:
P95 ≤120ms at production send volume with error <1%; post 14-day remediation plan with milestones and daily P95/error budget tracking.
No outbound sends to production audiences until performance meets target and consent compliance is cleared.
Reiterate deployment type and resource configuration in the publish settings per Replit guidance .
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Provisional status: GO-LIVE READY in Observer Mode only.
Conditions to clear for active sends:
auto_com_center meets P95 ≤120ms; Legal consent policy approved.
Maintain telemetry and fairness reporting; no external sends until prerequisites clear.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Provisional status: DELAYED (Legal Hold).
Conditions to clear:
FERPA/COPPA sign-off; parental consent workflow approved. Keep dark-launch allow-list only until cleared. These controls must be explicit and testable before B2C activation.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Provisional status: PENDING PACKAGE.
Conditions to clear:
Complete API documentation, auth, rate limiting, DR, and monitoring. Ensure integration contracts for student_pilot/provider_register are versioned and tested end-to-end.
Publish confirmation and health metrics per deployment checklist .
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Provisional status: PENDING PACKAGE.
Conditions to clear:
BI dashboards with accurate, real-time data; clear lineage and governance. Ensure Responsible AI analytics for bias/impact reporting in line with the Playbook’s strategy and KPI instrumentation for ARR-driving decisions .
Required status package format (submit per app)

Header (must match exactly per directive): APPLICATION NAME: [App] APP_BASE_URL: [URL]
Status: GO-LIVE READY or DELAYED
Section IV Confirmation: Bullet checklist mapping each requirement to evidence
Evidence links:
Health endpoint + uptime
API docs/specs
Security: MFA/SSO demo, RBAC roles, TLS report, key/session management summary, audit log screenshots, and review notes
Performance: last 24h P50/P95/P99, error rate, k6/Gatling artifacts
DR: backup/restore proof, RTO/RPO results
Integration: cross-app flow proof (e.g., student_pilot -> scholar_auth -> scholarship_api)
Publish info: last published timestamp and snapshot details per Replit model
Blockers (if any) and owner
Estimated go-live date and ARR ignition estimate tied to our KPI plan (B2C/B2B engine)
Today’s timeline (hard deadlines)

T+15 min: Confirm your assigned app(s), workspaces, and provide which packages you will submit before retest.
17:30 UTC: provider_register optimization complete; submit pre-retest evidence.
18:00–19:00 UTC: provider_register retest window with independent monitoring.
19:15 UTC: Post retest evidence and propose GO/NO-GO. I will decide in-channel.
By EOD: Submit status packages for all apps you own; any package missing required evidence will be marked DELAYED.
Financial lens and guardrails

We will not exchange near-term ARR for unverified risk. ARR scale depends on durable, low-CAC growth and trusted operations as outlined in our Playbook trajectory to multi-million ARR with B2B acceleration and strong governance .
Post-launch guardrails: autoscaling limits, error budget policy, and automatic rollback procedures must be enabled in the deployed app configuration per Replit deployment best practices .
CEO decisions on earlier options

Audit logs: Treat as P0. Do not go GA on provider_register until router guard, API client pattern, and SQL cursor handling are corrected and reviewed. You may prepare for retest in parallel, but GA remains blocked without the fixes.
scholarship_agent: Remains Observer Mode only until prerequisites clear.
student_pilot: Legal hold remains; no public access for minors without consent workflow.
Close
Act with urgency, but with evidence. Re-publish each app after fixes to generate a fresh snapshot and attach the publish details in your package; workspace-only changes do not count . I will approve go-live the moment the evidence meets the gates described above.
