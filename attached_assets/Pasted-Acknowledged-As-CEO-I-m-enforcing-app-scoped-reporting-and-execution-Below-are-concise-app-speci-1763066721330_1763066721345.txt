Acknowledged. As CEO, I’m enforcing app-scoped reporting and execution. Below are concise, app-specific status blocks and must-do items only for each app. Use these as your single source of truth and attach evidence links per app. Security, resiliency, and deployment guidance aligns to our Replit production standards and microservice best practices, including secure secrets, health checks, and phased rollout patterns   .

Today’s must-haves:

Implement and ship: OAuth2 Client Credentials (S2S), OIDC discovery (/.well-known), RBAC roles/permissions in token claims, CORS allowlist, MFA enrollment + challenge flow passing E2E. Secrets in Replit Secrets; no hardcoded tokens . Blockers:
None beyond engineering capacity. Assign senior engineer; form 2-person “tiger team” until green. Evidence to attach:
OIDC config URL, RBAC matrix in code (claims examples), Postman collection showing CC flow + MFA success, CORS policy file, audit log samples. Go-live ETA:

APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED
Today’s must-haves:

Stabilize JWT validation against scholar_auth JWKS; add DB + auth dependency checks to /health; enforce data integrity validations on submissions; wire event hook stubs for auto_com_center notifications. Add retry/backoff to external calls . Blockers:
Flaky JWKS validation under load; fix cache/timeout and key rotation handling . Evidence to attach:
Load test report (P95 ≤120ms; 0% auth errors), /health deep check output, validation test suite results, OpenAPI docs. Go-live ETA:
Nov 17, 12:00 PM MST (dependent on scholar_auth).
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED
Today’s must-haves:

Replace hardcoded URLs with env vars only; implement graceful API error states; complete E2E “Student Journey” test once backends are stable. If mobile, confirm offline mode decision; if required, deliver read-only cache for key screens . Blockers:
Backend instability (auth/api). Evidence to attach:
.env schema, UX error-state screenshots, E2E test plan. Go-live ETA:
Nov 18 (backend contingent).
APPLICATION NAME: provider_register APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED (Hotfix required)
Today’s must-haves:

Immediate rollback to last-known-good if 500 persists; env-var refactor; robust error handling for auth/api failures; prepare “Provider Journey” E2E test for RBAC-ready backends . Blockers:
RBAC-ready tokens from scholar_auth; stable scholarship_api validations. Evidence to attach:
Health check (200), .env schema, E2E checklist. Go-live ETA:
Nov 18 (backend contingent).
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED
Today’s must-haves:

Implement S2S auth to scholarship_api; performance test recommendation engine; finalize relevance/accuracy validation on production-like dataset. Log decisions and traceability for recommendations to satisfy Responsible AI transparency . Blockers:
S2S auth issuance from scholar_auth. Evidence to attach:
Perf report (throughput, P95), accuracy eval, S2S token flow proof. Go-live ETA:
Nov 19.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED
Today’s must-haves:

Use Client Credentials to call scholarship_api; add admin dashboard for job telemetry and audit logs; dry-run scheduled tasks; integrate with auto_com_center via env-configured endpoints . Blockers:
scholar_auth S2S issuance; scholarship_api event endpoints. Evidence to attach:
Job runs with logs, CC token flow, failure alert demo. Go-live ETA:
Nov 19.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_page_maker APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-m aker r-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: GO-LIVE READY
Today’s must-haves:

Publish now with Autoscale/Reserved VM as appropriate; confirm sitemap/robots, canonical tags, secrets set, and health checks. Attach deployment checklist and monitoring plan . Blockers:
None. Evidence to attach:
Health endpoint output, sitemap count, deployment settings, monitoring runbook. Go-live ETA:
Today.
APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Status: DELAYED
Today’s must-haves:

Ensure templates use env-based URLs only; complete load tests (≥200 rps sustained, P95 ≤120ms); implement bounce/drop monitoring and alerts; verify all provider API keys stored in Replit Secrets with rotation notes . Blockers:
Workspace access confirmation and final secrets audit. Evidence to attach:
k6 report, webhook logs, secrets inventory. Go-live ETA:
Nov 14.
CEO decisions to unblock execution

scholar_auth ownership: Reassign to Senior Engineer immediately; form 2-person tiger team until green. Authorization to pause all non-P0 items granted.
provider_register incident: Roll back now to last-known-good. If rollback fails, hotfix within 60 minutes. Feature freeze until Gate 1 passes.
Recovery Checkpoint: Confirmed Nov 14, 2:00 PM MST. Gate criteria: scholar_auth green; scholarship_api load test passing; provider_register healthy; auto_com_center load-tested.
ARR ignition contingency: If Gate fails Nov 14, slip to Nov 25 with reduced-scope launch; continue immediate SEO ignition via auto_page_maker to keep CAC low and organic growth compounding .
Must-have deliverables by 6:00 PM MST (scope-limited, code-level)

scholar_auth: 8 service clients provisioned; new role names in code + tokens; MFA enrollment + challenge E2E success; OIDC discovery live; CORS allowlist enforced; secrets verified in Replit Secrets .
scholarship_api: Stable JWKS verification under load; deep /health; validation suite passing; retry/backoff to auth calls; OpenAPI updated .
auto_com_center: Template catalog with variable map; secrets audit completed; load test script and baseline report attached .
Reminder on report hygiene

Each app report must contain only: APP header, status, today’s app-specific must-haves, app-local blockers, app evidence links, app go-live ETA. Cross-app content allowed only in the “Dependencies/Blockers” line when strictly necessary. Follow Replit production readiness and microservice resiliency patterns as baseline references, not content to be duplicated across apps .
