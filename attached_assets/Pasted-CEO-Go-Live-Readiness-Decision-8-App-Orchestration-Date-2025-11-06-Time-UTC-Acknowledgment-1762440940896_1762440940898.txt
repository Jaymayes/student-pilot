CEO Go-Live Readiness Decision — 8-App Orchestration
Date: 2025-11-06 | Time: UTC

Acknowledgment

Received Agent3 updates and evidence plan. Direction below preserves Nov 9 controlled ramp (1%) and Nov 12 ARR ignition, while protecting our SEO-first, low-CAC strategy and Responsible AI guardrails. The Playbook’s growth model and north-star activation metric (First Document Upload) remain our operating compass, with B2B as the primary revenue engine and SEO as the scale driver .
Executive Decisions (per app)

scholar_auth: Proceed with Plan B for today so staging E2E can run; Option A (issuer unification) exceeded timebox with residual issuer mismatch on library-generated error pages. Not a blocker for staging; must be eliminated before Nov 9 ramp via custom error templates/override. Owner: Auth DRI. Due: Nov 7, 18:00 UTC. Evidence: AUTH_OPTION_C_EVIDENCE.md + error-template diff.
scholarship_api: Staging GO immediately after auth clears. Deliver ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md per plan (endpoints, ACID proofs, token validation, P95 reads ≤120ms/writes ≤150ms, events to auto_page_maker and auto_com_center, request_id traces). Due: 06:05 UTC. Owner: API DRI.
scholarship_agent: Observe-only posture approved; notifications via auto_com_center email channel only (no auto-apply). Fairness telemetry and “why this match” explainability are required for Responsible AI compliance, consistent with our ethics framework for bias mitigation and transparent operation .
scholarship_sage: Start 48h observe-only baseline immediately after M2M secret rotation from scholar_auth. Deliver baseline_metrics_evidence.md (+48h) with precision@5, coverage, fairness telemetry, P95 ≤120ms, error <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9%, request_id traces.
student_pilot: Staging GO on auth clearance; run 95-step E2E, capture activation event (First Document Upload) and cross-browser evidence. Agent bridge “local-only” is non-blocking for E2E; ensure request_id propagation to Sentry is verified.
provider_register: Staging GO after auth clearance. Deliver ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md (OAuth PKCE S256, JWT roles=Provider, full CRUD to scholarship_api with request_id traces, dashboard checks, P95 ≤120ms, error <0.1%). Due: 05:25 UTC.
auto_page_maker: Staging GO and ARMED. Hold for scholarship_api Order 4 trigger; post sitemap diffs, IndexNow receipts, CWV p75 green proof, P95 fetches ≤120ms, rollback guard. Maintain noindex and robots discipline on staging. This remains our lowest-CAC growth lever per Playbook; keep flywheel tight to new scholarships and provider pages .
auto_com_center: Staging GO upon secrets. Production LOCKED. Email only via Postmark until A2P brand/campaign approval; SMS is production-only post-approval. Deliver STAGING_VALIDATION.md by 21:00 UTC with unsubscribe <5s under load, DLQ=0, SPF/DKIM/DMARC green, P95 ≤120ms, error <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9%, request_id traces and Sentry correlation, CAN-SPAM/TCPA/FERPA/COPPA logs, and Prometheus snapshots. Replit deployments must reflect correct secrets and domain setup per readiness guidance .
Third-Party Systems — Status, Owners, Deadlines

Postmark (staging email): Awaiting API key. Owner: Infra. Due: 16:00 UTC (auto-com_center staging GO blocker).
Twilio A2P (SMS): Awaiting credentials + brand/campaign approval. Owner: Compliance/Comms. Target: Nov 11 EOD. Note: SMS disabled until approved; email-only fallback remains active.
Sentry DSN: Awaiting DSNs across all apps. Owner: Infra. Due: 16:00 UTC. Required for cross-app request_id correlation at go/no-go.
AWS SQS/DLQ: Awaiting IAM/creds. Owner: Infra. Due: 16:00 UTC. DLQ must be 0 before evidence sign-off.
DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC for mail.scholaraiadvisor.com): Publish records and verify green. Owner: NetOps. Due: 17:00 UTC. This is explicitly required for deliverability and compliance evidence in STAGING_VALIDATION.md .
Stripe: Test mode OK; production rollout set to 0% until Nov 9 gates pass. Owner: Payments.
Gates to Unlock Nov 9 Controlled Ramp (1%)

Cross-app request_id correlation (auth → API → UX → comms) with Sentry links.
SLOs in staging: P95 ≤120ms, uptime ≥99.9%, error <0.1%.
Email deliverability: SPF/DKIM/DMARC green; unsubscribe <5s; DLQ=0.
Compliance: CAN-SPAM/TCPA/FERPA/COPPA evidence captured.
Student_pilot activation: First Document Upload funnel working and measured, aligned with Playbook KPI focus .
Risks and Mitigations

A2P SMS approval lag: Email-only fallback authorized; if A2P not approved by Nov 11 EOD, we maintain email-only through initial ramp and revisit SMS enablement post-approval.
Auth issuer mismatch on error pages: Implement custom error templates/overrides; due Nov 7 18:00 UTC; staging is not blocked but production ramp is gated.
Secrets delay at 16:00 UTC: Auto-escalation to Infra Lead + CFO at 16:01 UTC remains armed.

For your assigned app(s), post the final report with Application Name and APP_BASE_URL at the top (strict requirement):

Example header for your assignment:
Application: Auto Command Center (auto_com_center)

APP_BASE_URL (Prod): https://auto-com-center.scholaraiadvisor.com
If 100% readiness is not possible today, include:
Estimated Go-Live (date/time UTC) for 100% readiness
ARR Ignition date capability
Third-party systems list with status (Not Started/In Progress/Complete) and blockers
Post STAGING_VALIDATION.md by 21:00 UTC (auto_com_center), and ensure each evidence artifact is linked and reproducible. Secrets, domains, and monitoring configuration must reflect Replit deployment best practices and secrets management guidance .
Maintain Responsible AI logs (fairness, explainability, consent) per our governance framework for autonomous systems .
KPI Focus and Financial Guardrails

B2C: Activation (First Document Upload) drives conversion and LTV; ensure messaging and comms reinforce this event.
B2B: Provider onboarding, scholarship creation throughput, and 3% platform fee path verified end-to-end; per Playbook, B2B remains the decisive contributor to the $10M ARR path, with SEO driving top-of-funnel at low CAC .
Final CEO Notes

Evidence-first remains non-negotiable. No production changes without artifacts. Our architecture runs on autonomous execution with human governance; keep cross-app observability tight and decisions data-driven .
Proceed with urgency; protect the Nov 9/Nov 12 milestones.
