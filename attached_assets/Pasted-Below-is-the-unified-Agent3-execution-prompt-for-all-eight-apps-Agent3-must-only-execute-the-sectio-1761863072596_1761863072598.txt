Below is the unified Agent3 execution prompt for all eight apps. Agent3 must only execute the section that matches its assigned app. Each section includes: handshake, scope, required endpoints/features, security/SLOs, integration contracts, acceptance tests, deliverables, GO/NO-GO gates, and an ETA to be ready to start generating revenue. If you meant “stop generating revenue,” tell me and I’ll adjust.

Section 0 — Universal Instructions (ALL APPS, READ-ONLY EXCEPT WHERE SPECIFIED)

Only execute your own app’s section. Do not alter sibling apps, schemas, keys, or production data for other services.
Immediately output a HANDSHAKE block to logs and your readiness report: ASSIGNED_APP: <one of: scholar_auth | scholarship_api | scholarship_agent | scholarship_sage | student_pilot | provider_register | auto_page_maker | auto_com_center> APP_BASE_URL: <your app’s base URL from the mapping below> VERSION: v2.3 ACKNOWLEDGMENT: I will only execute the section of this prompt that matches my app.
Base URLs (for CORS, integration contracts, and tests): scholar_auth → https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app scholarship_api → https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app scholarship_agent → https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app scholarship_sage → https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app student_pilot → https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app provider_register → https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app auto_page_maker → https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app auto_com_center → https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Phase 0 universal requirements you must implement for your app:
Canary endpoints:
GET /canary returns JSON with fields: app_name, app_base_url, version, status, p95_ms, server_time_utc, commit_sha.
GET /_canary_no_cache same payload; add Cache-Control: no-store and Pragma: no-cache.
P95 tracking: rolling 30-request window; record duration_ms per request; report p95_ms via /canary.

Deliverables you must produce for your app:
e2e/reports/<app>/readiness_report_<app>_v2.3_ceo_final.md
e2e/reports/<app>/fix_plan_<app>_v2.3_ceo_final.yaml Each report includes: handshake, endpoints summary, SLO evidence plan, security headers config, CORS config, rate limits, test commands, GO/NO-GO decision, rollout/rollback.

iss: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
aud: one of the eight app base URLs (match exact origin)
claims: sub, iat, exp, iss, aud, email, roles (["student"] or ["provider"] or ["admin"]), scopes (subset of ["openid","email","profile","provider"])
OIDC endpoints (scholar_auth):
/.well-known/openid-configuration includes code_challenge_methods_supported: ["S256"]
/oidc/auth and /oidc/token implement Authorization Code + PKCE S256
/api/auth/session returns current user session snapshot for UI apps
HTTP contracting standards:
All list endpoints support ETag and If-None-Match; include Cache-Control headers appropriate to endpoint.
All POST/PUT endpoints validate JWT, role, scope, aud, and exp. Return 401/403 with JSON error format above.
CORS allowlist across all apps is the eight base URLs above, exactly.

Section 4 — Reporting Format (ALL APPS)

In your readiness report, include a one-line Status Report JSON: { "app_name": "<your app>", "app_base_url": "<your base url>", "version": "v2.3", "status": "ok"|"degraded"|"blocked", "p95_ms": <number>, "commit_sha": "<identifier>", "server_time_utc": "<ISO-8601>" }
Include copy-pasteable curl commands for each acceptance test.
Include a GO/NO-GO decision table listing each gate and pass/fail.
Include a short rollback plan for your app.
Section 5 — Revenue Path and ETAs (Reference for all agents; execute only for your app)

Fastest B2C path to first dollar (student credits):
scholar_auth ready (0.5–2.0h)
scholarship_api reads ready (1.5–2.0h)
student_pilot with Stripe in test mode (2–6h) Aggregate ETA to start generating B2C revenue: 4–10 hours from kickoff if done in parallel.
Fastest B2B path to first dollar (provider fee):
scholar_auth ready (0.5–2.0h)
scholarship_api writes ready (+2–3h after auth)
provider_register onboarding and publish (5–7h) Aggregate ETA to start generating B2B revenue: 6–12 hours from kickoff if staged well.
Supporting apps ETAs:
scholarship_agent: 3–6h to contribute (reduces CAC; not on first-dollar critical path)
auto_page_maker: 4–8h to contribute (compounding organic growth)
auto_com_center: 4–6h to contribute (activation and retention)
scholarship_sage: 2–4h to contribute (reduces MTTR and protects revenue)
Section 6 — Blockers and Escalations (ALL APPS)

If any universal requirement or dependency blocks you for more than 30 minutes:
Mark status="blocked" in your readiness report.
Include a minimal reproducible example and the failing curl output.
Propose a concrete fix with estimated effort and request CEO approval if it affects shared contracts.
Section 7 — Final Output Required from Each Agent (ALL APPS)

Post the handshake line to logs immediately.
Implement Phase 0 universal requirements, then your app-specific features.
Produce:
e2e/reports/<app>/readiness_report_<app>_v2.3_ceo_final.md
e2e/reports/<app>/fix_plan_<app>_v2.3_ceo_final.yaml
Include in your readiness report the app’s name and APP_BASE_URL explicitly, and a Status Report JSON as specified.
Return GO if all gates pass; otherwise return NO-GO with a prioritized fix list and ETA.
Notes from the CEO

Think data-first and bias for action. The five-year plan targets $10M profitable ARR; low-CAC organic acquisition via auto_page_maker is our cornerstone, but the fastest first dollar is B2C via student_pilot once scholar_auth and scholarship_api reads are live.
Interpreting your “stop generating revenue” phrase as “start generating revenue.” If you meant otherwise, say so and I’ll issue an updated directive immediately.
