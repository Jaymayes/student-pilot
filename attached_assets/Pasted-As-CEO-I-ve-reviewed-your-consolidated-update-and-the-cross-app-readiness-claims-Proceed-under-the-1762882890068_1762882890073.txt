As CEO, I’ve reviewed your consolidated update and the cross-app readiness claims. Proceed under the following final executive decisions, gates, and SLAs. All timings UTC.

Executive Summary

Prime directive alignment: Maintained. We preserve low-CAC, SEO-led growth, enforce SLOs, and keep HOTL/Responsible AI gates intact on the path to $10M profitable ARR.
Critical path: Gate A (deliverability), Gate B (Stripe), Gate C (auth P95). No broad student email sends until Gate A passes. No provider charges until Gate B passes and CEO FULL GO. Student launch depends on Gate A + Gate C + activation telemetry.
Application Decisions, Orders, and Evidence SLAs

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: PENDING — Gate A deliverability
Orders:
14:00 UTC: If DKIM CNAMEs still not provisioned, you are authorized to pivot to SendGrid (preferred) or AWS SES (secondary). Target Gate A ready by 19:00 UTC if pivot.
20:00–20:15 UTC: Execute Gate A; 15-minute evidence SLA (raw DNS dig outputs, seed inbox screenshots, Postmark/ESP logs).
Inbox placement ≥80%, complaints ≤0.1%, bounces ≤2%. DMARC p=quarantine, SPF/DKIM aligned.
If Gate A fails, immediately switch student-facing comms to in-app notifications; retry Gate A at 12:00 UTC tomorrow.

Status: CONDITIONAL — Pending Gate C P95
Orders:
Today 23:00 UTC: Deliver MFA QA evidence (screenshots + DB verification + console logs).
Nov 12, 20:00–20:15 UTC: Execute Gate C load/perf; P95 ≤120ms across 7 core endpoints. Evidence due by 20:30 UTC (latency histograms, error budgets, saturation, k6/artillery outputs).

Webhook signature verification pass
Deterministic 3% fee event logging with request_id lineage

Finance sign-off captured
Keep ENABLE_WAITLIST_MODE=true until CEO FULL GO after Gate C passes.
APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GO-LIVE READY (Observer/Frozen) — Approved
Orders:
Ship 06:00 UTC cross-app KPI rollup daily. Integrate gate outcomes within the next rollup following completion.
Keep observer mode, no autonomous decisions. Fairness telemetry implementation Nov 13–14 as planned.
APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Status: GO-LIVE READY (Observer/Frozen) — Approved

Company-Level Gates, KPIs, and Evidence

Gates and SLAs
Gate B (Stripe): Nov 11, 18:00–18:15 UTC — provider_register
Gate A (Deliverability): Nov 11, 20:00–20:15 UTC — auto_com_center
Gate C (Auth P95): Nov 12, 20:00–20:15 UTC — scholar_auth
Each gate has a 15-minute evidence submission SLA to the central index.
Daily 06:00 UTC KPI rollup (scholarship_sage)
B2C: Organic sessions, sign-ups, activation rate (North Star: first document upload), free→paid conversion, credits ARPU.
B2B: Providers onboarded, live offers, GMV, accrued 3% fees.
SLOs: Uptime, P95 latency, error rates by app.
Gate tracker: Add PASS/FAIL outcomes as they happen.
Responsible AI and Compliance
HOTL governance enforced; no black-box decisioning.
Audit trails: 100% request_id lineage across apps.
Data retention schedule due Nov 14, 20:00 UTC.
DR test: Nov 17, 02:00–04:00 UTC; evidence due Nov 18, 12:00 UTC (RPO ≤15m, RTO ≤30m).
Continue FERPA/COPPA/GDPR posture with encryption in transit and at rest; maintain SOC 2 auditability.
ARR Ignition Timeline and Conditions

B2C credits revenue: Earliest Nov 13–15, contingent on Gate A + Gate C + student_pilot GO.
B2B 3% platform fees: Earliest Nov 14–15, contingent on Gate B + Gate C + CEO FULL GO.
CAC near-zero preserved by auto_page_maker freeze and SEO flywheel; no paid acquisition authorized at this time.
Capital and Contingency Authorizations

ESP Pivot Budget: Approved to execute SendGrid pivot (preferred) or AWS SES if DKIM not provisioned by 14:00 UTC; target Gate A ready by 19:00 UTC. Keep in-app notification fallback live until Gate A PASS.
Reserved VM/Infra: Approved as proposed to protect SLOs with 5-minute rollback.
Immediate Actions (Today)

14:00 UTC: DKIM escalation checkpoint — execute ESP pivot if unresolved.
18:00–18:15 UTC: Gate B execution + evidence.
20:00–20:15 UTC: Gate A execution + evidence.
23:00 UTC: scholar_auth MFA QA evidence due.
Evidence Handling

Maintain the central Executive Root Index linking all gate evidence, QA artifacts, and Section V reports.
For any “DELAYED” or “FAIL” gate outcomes, submit root cause + remediation ETA within the same 15-minute evidence SLA.
Final CEO Confirmation

Proceed as ordered. No relaxation of gates or SLAs.
Student funnel must never pause; in-app notifications are the mandated fallback if Gate A fails.
I will make the student_pilot GO/NO-GO call on Nov 13 at 16:00 UTC based on Gate A/C outcomes and the 06:00 UTC activation telemetry.
If any dependency or evidence will miss its SLA by more than 15 minutes, escalate to me immediately with a mitigation plan and revised ETA.
