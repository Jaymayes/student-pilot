CEO Executive Orders — Scholar AI Advisor
Date: 2025-11-10

Executive Summary

Overall trajectory: on track for ARR ignition pending Gate A, B, C.
I accept the evidence and statuses presented. Where “Frozen” is stated, maintain the freeze through Nov 12, 20:00 UTC unless explicitly lifted by me.
Daily 06:00 UTC KPI rollups remain mandatory for cross-app visibility and SEO-led, low-CAC growth.
Decision — MFA Enrollment Blocker (scholar_auth)
Decision: Approve Option A (Parallel Implementation).
Rationale: Protects the hard gate (P95 ≤120ms by Nov 12, 20:00 UTC) while satisfying the “IMMEDIATE” directive without jeopardizing performance.
Orders and deadlines:
Today: Open voluntary enrollment window for TOTP/WebAuthn; surface the prompt to all roles at login with skip allowed.
Nov 12, 20:00 UTC: Gate C performance target must be met with P95 ≤120ms. No regressions from the enrollment UI flow.
Nov 15, 20:00 UTC: Admin MFA mandatory enforcement begins (no exceptions).
Nov 18, 20:00 UTC: Provider admin MFA enforcement begins.
Nov 25, 20:00 UTC: Student MFA soft enforcement (progressive friction) with opt-out for accessibility exemptions; publish policy.
Guardrails:
No increase to error rate or P95 during the sprint; keep compensating controls (admin rate limits) active.
Full audit trail for enrollment decisions; add metrics to daily KPI: enrollment rate by role, failures, time-to-enroll.
2. Gates — Confirmation and Pass/Fail Criteria

Gate B (Stripe PASS) — Nov 11, 18:00 UTC

Owner: provider_register + Finance
PASS requires: live key validation, webhook receipt with signature verification, 3% fee events logged, refund webhook tested.
Status: Proceed as scheduled. Provide PASS/FAIL summary by 18:15 UTC.
Gate A (Deliverability GREEN) — Nov 11, 20:00–20:15 UTC

Owner: auto_com_center
PASS requires: SPF aligned; DKIM aligned; DMARC p=quarantine verified; seed inbox placement ≥80%; complaint ≤0.1%; bounce ≤2%.
Contingency if FAIL: Immediately switch to in-app notifications only; do not pause student_pilot onboarding.
Escalation: If Postmark access or DKIM CNAMEs are not delivered by Nov 11, 14:00 UTC, escalate to me; if DNS not live within 1 hour of CNAME receipt, escalate.
Gate C (Auth P95 ≤120ms) — Nov 12, 20:00–20:15 UTC

Owner: scholar_auth
PASS requires: under-load P95 ≤120ms; ≥99.5% auth success; error taxonomy documented; audit lineage samples included.
If risk of miss emerges during pre-soak, alert me immediately with mitigation options.
3. App-Level Go/No-Go Decisions and Orders

APPLICATION NAME: auto_page_maker
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-page-maker-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: GO (Frozen) affirmed.
Orders: Maintain change freeze; keep CWV p75 GREEN and indexation ≥95%; 06:00 UTC KPI exports must continue. Any CWV regression or indexation dip below 92% triggers an immediate alert and a hold on new page generation until corrected.

APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_api
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: GO (Frozen) affirmed.
Orders: Keep OpenAPI published and versioned; maintain 100% request_id coverage. Proceed with DEF-005 rate-limiter migration post-freeze per plan (Nov 12 20:00 → Nov 13 12:00). Do not jeopardize P95; roll back within 5 minutes if SLOs are threatened.

APPLICATION NAME: scholar_auth
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Conditional GO, Gate C owner.
Orders: Execute Option A MFA plan above; hit P95 target by Nov 12, 20:00. Add daily KPI on MFA enrollment rates and auth success distribution.

APPLICATION NAME: auto_com_center
APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Conditional GO, Gate A owner.
Orders: Deliver Gate A evidence by Nov 11, 20:15 UTC. If FAIL, auto-transition to in-app notifications for student_pilot. Provide a remediation ETA and next attempt window (Nov 12, 12:00 UTC). Prepare DMARC move to p=reject within 7 days post-PASS.

APPLICATION NAME: provider_register
APP_BASE_URL: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Ready, pending Gate B and Gate C.
Orders: Validate Stripe webhooks end-to-end, including refund scenarios; confirm deterministic 3% fee in audit logs. No charges until FULL GO is authorized by me.

APPLICATION NAME: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Conditional GO for Nov 13, 16:00 UTC.
Orders: Enforce contingency to operate without email if Gate A fails; ensure “first document upload” activation telemetry is live; keep refund and rollback runbook at hand for T+24/T+48 after go-live.

APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_agent
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Observer/Frozen affirmed.
Orders: Maintain HITL/HOTL approval gates; address 8 selection parity violations post-freeze. Targets by Nov 15, 20:00: keep rationale coverage ≥95%, FPR ≤2%, reduce parity violations to ≤2 cohorts or provide justification and mitigation.

APPLICATION NAME: scholarship_sage
APP_BASE_URL: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Decision: Observer/Frozen affirmed.
Orders: Finalize the fairness integration spec by Nov 12, 22:00 UTC including HOTL integration, parity metrics, redress workflow, and SOC 2 alignment. Begin ingest of 06:00 UTC KPIs across apps and publish the cross-app daily rollup.

4. Capital Allocation and Constraints

Approved: Reserved VM for auto_com_center.
Approved: Postmark/ESP and DNS changes required for Gate A; move to p=reject DMARC one week after PASS.
Constraint: Maintain lean operations; prioritize organic SEO-led growth. No paid acquisition.
5. Evidence and Reporting Requirements

Maintain the Executive Root Index with one-click navigation to each app’s Section V status report; all reports must include the APPLICATION NAME and APP_BASE_URL at the top.
Gate evidence SLAs:
Gate B: PASS/FAIL summary + webhook logs within 15 minutes of deadline.
Gate A: Verification screenshots, seed test results, suppression hygiene, and PASS/FAIL summary within 15 minutes of deadline.
Gate C: Load test report, success/error distribution, audit lineage samples within 15 minutes of deadline.
Daily 06:00 UTC cross-app KPI rollup must include: uptime, P95, error rate, auth success, deliverability status, SEO indexation and traffic, activation, conversion, ARPU, active providers, B2C/B2B revenue, fairness metrics (agent at 12:00 UTC).
6. Risk Register — Watch Items

Email deliverability (Gate A): High external dependency risk; contingency confirmed.
Auth performance (Gate C): Critical ARR blocker; Option A approved with guardrails.
Fairness parity violations (scholarship_agent): Non-blocking pre-go-live; must be reduced before campaigns.
Rate-limit fallback (scholarship_api): Non-blocking; implement post-freeze with fast rollback.
7. ARR Ignition Plan — Current Earliest Windows

B2C credits (student_pilot + scholarship_api): Nov 13–15, contingent on Gates A and C.
B2B 3% platform fees (provider_register + scholarship_api): Nov 14–15, contingent on Gates A, B, and C.
SEO flywheel (auto_page_maker): Protected; KPI exports continue; CAC kept near zero.
Immediate Actions Recap

scholar_auth: Execute Option A now; keep P95 on target, report MFA enrollment metrics starting next 06:00 UTC rollup.
auto_com_center: Hit Gate A by Nov 11, 20:15 UTC; if blockers persist past escalation windows, notify me; switch to in-app notifications if FAIL.
provider_register: Deliver Gate B with Finance on Nov 11, 18:00 UTC and report within 15 minutes.
scholarship_sage: Prepare the first 06:00 UTC cross-app KPI rollup for Nov 11; finalize fairness spec by Nov 12, 22:00.
Close
Proceed as ordered. Keep me informed at each gate with the required evidence within 15 minutes of the deadline. Any SLO breach, seed-test failure, or auth regression triggers an immediate executive alert and freeze extension.
