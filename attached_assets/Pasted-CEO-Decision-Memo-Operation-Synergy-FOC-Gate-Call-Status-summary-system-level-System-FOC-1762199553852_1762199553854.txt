CEO Decision Memo — Operation Synergy (FOC Gate Call)

Status summary (system-level)

System FOC: NO-GO (single hard gate: auto_com_center canary stability)
B2C engine: LIVE (student_pilot + scholarship_api + scholarship_sage + auto_page_maker). Observe-only events enforced.
B2B engine: Unblocked pending provider_register E2E completion.
Gate decisions by application (effective immediately)

scholar_auth: GO (conditional) — pending operator CORS env-var sync and post-sync verification evidence. Maintain JWKS availability and RBAC claims integrity.
scholarship_api: GO (unconditional) — freeze on schema/API upheld; standardized errors and RBAC verified; observe-only fan-out maintained.
scholarship_agent: GO (observe-only) — circuit breakers, backoff, bulkheads in place; stand by to generate DRY-RUN volume on GREEN from comms.
scholarship_sage: GO — explainability (matchReasons), request correlation, and fairness plan accepted; feature-flag plan staged for post-FOC A/B.
student_pilot: GO — launch accepted; 24-hour funnel readout + Lighthouse/CWV snapshot due.
provider_register: READY (E2E to run now) — temporary client issuance acknowledged; proceed with 90-minute E2E and submit evidence bundle.
auto_page_maker: GO — continue hourly deltas and nightly sitemap/IndexNow; weekly SEO report begins post-FOC.
auto_com_center: NO-GO (hard gate) — await canary GREEN; DRY-RUN to execute within 120 minutes of GREEN.
Immediate orders and SLAs

auto_com_center (Owner: Comms Infra + App DRI)

Canary gate at T+90: GREEN/RED determination. Acceptance criteria: zero loss at 2× peak; P95 delivery <250ms; opt-out compliance proven; rollback plan documented.
If GREEN: Execute 120-minute DRY-RUN (30k msgs @ 500/min sustained). Deliver 10-artifact evidence bundle with SHA256 manifest within 30 minutes post-run.
If RED: Maintain observe-only, support root-cause, propose next tuning window within 60 minutes.
Budget: $5k SRE approved; up to $10k contingency pre-approved for DRY-RUN success.
scholar_auth (Owner: Auth DRI + Operator)

Execute CORS env-var sync immediately; Auth DRI to provide post-sync verification within 5 minutes (JWT validation across all consumer apps).
Confirm M2M scope enforcement for SystemService role and JWKS stability.
provider_register (Owner: Provider DRI)

Start 90-minute E2E now using the issued temporary client.
Evidence bundle (due T+105 from start): OAuth PKCE S256 round-trip, 30-sample RBAC tenant isolation, standardized errors with request_id, 6/6 security headers, P95 ≤120ms, ≤0.1% 5xx, SHA256 manifest.
Temporary client removal plan: Coordinate with Auth DRI for cleanup within 24 hours or upon permanent client reconciliation (whichever comes first).
student_pilot (Owner: Student DRI)

24-hour funnel readout: sign-ups, activation, free→paid conversion, ARPU per credit. Include CWV/Lighthouse for key flows.
auto_page_maker (Owner: Growth DRI)

Maintain TTFB around ~100ms; deliver first weekly report post-FOC: page-count growth, indexation rate (GSC), CTR, assisted conversions, CWV.
scholarship_agent (Owner: Automation DRI)

Maintain 30-minute status cadence; keep circuit breakers closed/healthy; on GREEN from comms, generate DRY-RUN volume per plan.
Evidence discipline (all DRIs)

Maintain freeze discipline where ordered.
Standardized JSON errors with request_id across services.
RBAC: verify roles/claims consistently enforced; 401/403 semantics standardized.
Security: 6/6 headers; HTTPS/TLS everywhere; no credential management outside scholar_auth.
Submit Section 7 reports with SHA256-verified artifacts. If already submitted, respond with manifest and path.
KPI focus and financial alignment

B2C: Free→paid conversion and ARPU per credit are the north-star. Protect CWV/TTFB and recommendation latency to sustain conversion.
B2B: Provider onboarding throughput drives 3% platform fee. Unblock provider_register E2E to re-open this revenue lane.
CAC: Prioritize SEO (Auto Page Maker growth engine) over paid acquisition; ensure indexation velocity and CTR improvements are tracked weekly.
Profitability: Maintain 4× AI services markup and enforce 3% provider fee; monitor P95 latency targets (≤120ms) to reduce infra costs.
Risk register and mitigations

Hard gate risk (auto_com_center): Contained by observe-only stance and circuit breakers; DRY-RUN gated on canary GREEN with binary PASS/FAIL.
Auth configuration drift (CORS/clients): Mitigate via immutable audit logs, post-change verification artifacts, and 24-hour expiry for temporary clients.
Compliance risk: CAN-SPAM/GDPR/FERPA/COPPA — ensure unsubscribe and data handling safeguards proven in evidence bundles.
Lifecycle and revenue cessation policy (directive)

Each DRI must include Lifecycle and Revenue Cessation Analysis in Section 7:
Infrastructure (auth/api/comms): 5–7 years typical. Assess security protocol evolution (beyond OAuth 2.0), scale limits, vendor/runtime EOL.
User-facing (student_pilot/provider_register): 3–4 years typical. Assess UX/design trends and competitive bar.
Intelligence/Automation (sage/agent/page_maker): 2–3 years typical. Assess model/agentic advances and commoditization risk.
Provide an estimated quarter/year (e.g., Q4 2028), rationale, and contingencies that could accelerate or extend the horizon.
