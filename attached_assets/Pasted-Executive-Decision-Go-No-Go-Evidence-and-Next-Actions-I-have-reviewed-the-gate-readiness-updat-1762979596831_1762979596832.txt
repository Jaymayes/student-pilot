Executive Decision: Go/No‑Go, Evidence, and Next Actions

I have reviewed the gate-readiness updates and tonight’s Prime Directive execution plan. Decisions below are issued to protect trust/SLOs while preserving the Nov 13–15 ARR ignition window.

Portfolio decisions

Gate A (auto_com_center): NO‑GO for production traffic. Proceed with observer mode and internal canary only. The 30K webhook replay must pass cleanly (idempotent, ordered, ≥99.9% delivered) and P95 ≤120ms before any external sends. Evidence gaps (deliverability, webhooks at scale, RBAC, audit logs) must be closed before promotion.
Gate C (scholar_auth): Conditional GO for internal/UAT traffic only. OIDC/JWKS is verified; however, full MFA/SSO, token lifecycle, RBAC, and audit-log evidence must be produced before enabling broader ecosystem dependencies. Any auth anomaly triggers immediate rollback.
student_pilot: HOLD. No prod release until Legal completes ToS/Privacy/COPPA approval and age-gated consent is validated in evidence. Your hold is correct.
provider_register: DELAYED as planned. Retest window Nov 13 18:00–19:00 UTC stands; ensure 3% fee E2E, circuit breaker, UAT sign-offs are in the evidence bundle.
auto_page_maker: GO for the 22:15 UTC canary under strict guardrails. Success requires CWV pass (LCP ≤2.5s at p75, CLS ≤0.1, INP within guidance), IndexNow ≥95%, and error rate ≤0.10%. Auto-rollback if thresholds are breached for >10 minutes. Cap canary to a minimal page cohort and publish the canary list in the evidence.
scholarship_agent: Observer mode only (no outbound campaigns) until Gate A/C pass and Legal consent is cleared. Warm-up staging and telemetry are approved.
scholarship_api: Maintain change freeze; continue SLO monitoring. Open a Sev‑2 on the Redis degradation with a post-freeze remediation plan and rollback playbook.
Directive on the 30K webhook replay (Gate A)

Decision on your A/B/C question: C for the next 15 minutes, then A.
Immediately run a 1K–5K synthetic webhook batch to capture high-signal diagnostics within the evidence window, but do not claim PASS. Use this to localize the bottleneck.
Then prioritize a root-cause sprint and re-run the full 30K replay before 02:00 UTC. Full PASS at 30K is mandatory for production GO.
Triage steps to execute now:
Queue/backpressure: Inspect broker metrics (enqueue/dequeue, consumer lag), worker concurrency, and per-shard saturation. Eliminate single-threaded bottlenecks.
HMAC/CPU: Measure HMAC verification cost; ensure vectorized/async verification and reuse of parsed headers. Confirm constant-time compare.
Storage hot spots: Check DB write IOPS, lock contention, and partition hot keys on idempotency and request_id indexes; add covering indexes where missing.
Idempotency store: Verify O(1) lookups, TTL policy, and unique constraints on event_id. Confirm exactly-once semantics under retry storms.
Retry/backoff: Confirm 202 ack-on-receipt, exponential backoff with jitter, dead-letter policy, and per-tenant rate limits. Eliminate synchronous downstream calls in the webhook path.
Network/egress quotas: Validate outbound limits, TLS session reuse, and ephemeral port exhaustion.
Evidence required for PASS:
30K replay report with ordered delivery proofs, dedupe metrics, and zero data loss
P95/P99 histograms under load; error-budget ledger
Immutable audit logs with request_id lineage across producer → consumer → persistence
RBAC test matrix and HOTL approvals
SPF/DKIM/DMARC and seed‑list deliverability at ≥95%
Evidence and reporting (Section V format)

For every app you directly own tonight, submit Section V status reports with the exact header format:
APPLICATION NAME: [App Name]
APP_BASE_URL: [URL]
Status: [GO-LIVE READY | DELAYED | OBSERVER MODE | HOLD]
Include explicit links to health endpoints, API docs, and evidence bundles with SHA‑256 manifests.
Deadlines:
20:30 UTC: Submit interim evidence bundles for Gate A and Gate C, marked CONDITIONAL and noting every gap.
22:00 UTC: Post-mortem note on the webhook failure mode with mitigation plan and owners.
02:00 UTC: Re-run 30K replay and file final Gate A PASS/FAIL.
09:00 UTC (Nov 13): Daily checkpoint with KPI deltas and revised GO/NO‑GO.
Operational guardrails and rollback

Gate A auto-abort if sustained >5 minutes: P95 >120ms, error rate >0.10%, inbox placement <95%, or webhook ordering/idempotency anomalies.
Gate C abort if: OIDC discovery/JWKS failures, token revocation lag >2 minutes, or any RBAC escalation.
auto_page_maker canary rollback if CWV or error-rate thresholds breach >10 minutes.
ARR and KPI alignment

ARR ignition window Nov 13–15 remains achievable with the above gating:
B2C: student_pilot remains blocked pending Legal; no exceptions.
B2B: provider_register retest on Nov 13 is the critical path for fee capture. Ensure payment flows and fee accrual evidence are complete.
Organic growth: auto_page_maker canary is approved; prioritize CWV and indexing gains to feed low‑CAC acquisition.
Close

Execute the above immediately. Keep operations lean and data-first. Do not trade security, compliance, or reliability for speed.
Return the Section V reports per assigned app within the stated deadlines. If any deadline is at risk, escalate with a timestamped blocker, owner, and recovery ETA.
