CEO decision and next steps

Decision: GO NOW, with a 60‑minute “first live dollar” validation, followed by a 24‑hour hardening pass. We’ll keep human-in-the-loop guardrails during this phase and treat every API as a product with clear contracts and ownership to minimize execution risk and speed learning from live data. This aligns with our governance principles for autonomous systems and API-as-a-product discipline  .

What I want you to do now (T+60 minutes)

Unblock notifications and run the purchase
Set NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET in both auto_com_center and provider_register (same value). Timebox: 15 minutes.
Smoke test POST /api/send on auto_com_center using the secret.
Execute a live $5–$10 purchase via student_pilot. Acceptable to use existing login if scholar_auth signup is degraded; we’ll fix auth migrations in the 24‑hour pass.
Verify credits posted in student_pilot and the transaction ledger is recorded in scholarship_api.
Required evidence (attach screenshots/JSON):

Stripe Dashboard: live charge details
student_pilot: updated credit balance
scholarship_api: transaction/ledger fetch for the user
2. Minimal deliverability check (parallel, do not block revenue test)

Attempt a receipt email via auto_com_center after the purchase.
If email fails, do not halt—complete the revenue flow; log the error and proceed.
3. Post “Production Status Reports” (end of the 60 minutes)

auto_com_center and provider_register: publish “Production Status Report: [YOUR_APP_NAME]” in the exact 4‑section format from the Master Prompt.
Environment variables to verify now (highest ROI path)

A. auto_com_center (priority: immediate)

Required: APP_BASE_URL, POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN, DATABASE_URL, NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
Security/ops: CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS, JWT_ISSUER, JWT_AUDIENCE, SENTRY_DSN
Optional: TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN Acceptance checks:
GET /readyz returns OK
POST /api/send returns 200 with a valid template payload
CORS allows only ecosystem domains
B. provider_register (priority: immediate)

Required: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (live), STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (live), DATABASE_URL, APP_BASE_URL
Integrations: AUTO_COM_CENTER_BASE_URL, SCHOLAR_AUTH_BASE_URL (or AUTH_JWKS_URL) Acceptance checks:
Stripe webhook verified and receiving events
On successful payment, outbound call to auto_com_center includes NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
C. student_pilot (priority: as part of the test)

Required: STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY (live), SCHOLARSHIP_API_BASE_URL, AUTO_COM_CENTER_BASE_URL, SCHOLAR_AUTH_BASE_URL Acceptance checks:
Checkout can start and complete
Post‑purchase calls to scholarship_api succeed
D. scholarship_api (priority: confirm JWT and ledger)

Required: DATABASE_URL, AUTH_JWKS_URL (points to scholar_auth), CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS
Ops: EVENT_BUS_URL/TOKEN if used Acceptance checks:
/readyz healthy (DB and JWKS green)
Credit ledger write/read path works
E. scholar_auth (priority: 24‑hour window)

Required: DATABASE_URL, OIDC_ISSUER, JWKS keys/secrets, SESSION_SECRET, APP_BASE_URL Action: Run migrations to resolve password_hash or related schema issues; confirm /readyz=200.
Go/no‑go gate for the 60‑minute run

Go if: NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET is set in both services, Stripe live keys verified, scholarship_api ledger read/write OK, student_pilot can complete checkout.
No‑go only if: Stripe live keys or scholarship_api ledger are failing (fix immediately and retry within the window).
24‑hour hardening plan (after first dollar)

Fix scholar_auth DB migrations; re‑enable full signup + recovery.
Add /send-notification alias to auto_com_center (keep /api/send; deprecate later).
Lock CORS allowlist across all services; add Sentry DSNs consistently.
E2E JWT issuance/verification test across all apps; capture P95 latency targets.
Run 3‑inbox deliverability test (Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo) and capture DKIM/SPF/DMARC.
KPIs to capture from this run

Time-to-first-dollar (TFF$)
Webhook success rate (Stripe → provider_register, provider_register → auto_com_center)
P95 latency across the messaging and ledger endpoints (target ~120ms)
Email deliverability attempt status (don’t block on this)
Why this approach

Phased rollout with human approval points reduces risk while accelerating learning; treat APIs as products with clear contracts and observability from day one .
Governance and explainability during early autonomy builds trust and prevents regressions as we scale agents’ permissions .
This is the fastest path to validate our B2C credit purchase loop while keeping security and reliability standards intact.
Answer to your question: Yes—help me verify env vars now
Start with auto_com_center and provider_register exactly as listed above. Post a short “Secrets Check” snippet per app showing present/missing for the names (no values). Then proceed with the 60‑minute run.

Dependencies/asks from you

Confirm three test inboxes for deliverability (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) for the 24‑hour pass.
Confirm Stripe is in LIVE mode for provider_register and student_pilot.
I will review the two Production Status Reports and the evidence bundle immediately on completion and authorize widening the funnel.
