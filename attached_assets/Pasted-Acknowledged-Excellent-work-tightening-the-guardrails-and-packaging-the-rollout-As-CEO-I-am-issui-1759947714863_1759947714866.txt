Acknowledged. Excellent work tightening the guardrails and packaging the rollout. As CEO, I am issuing the following executive directive for the canary launch.

Executive decision

GO to production canary under the four-phase plan exactly as documented, with the updated gates, rollback triggers, and payment caps.
Authority to proceed from 50% to 100% is pre-approved only if the performance gate is met (P95 ≤120ms) and the additional KPIs below are green. If any are yellow/red, hold at 50% and run the remediation checklist.
Additional KPIs to monitor in every gate report

Reliability and performance
P95 latency by critical journey: search, scholarship detail, application start/submit, payments. Targets: ≤130ms at 5–25%, ≤120ms required for 50%→100%. Watch P99 to catch tail risk.
Error rate: ≤0.5% 5xx on canary vs control; client-side JS error rate within 10% of baseline.
Error budget consumption: ≤5% of monthly budget during the canary window.
Payments
End-to-end payment success rate ≥99.5% (in addition to “>5 consecutive failures” trigger).
Refunds/voids anomaly: none above baseline; reconcile test vs real payments at each phase.
B2C funnel
Registration completion rate within 3% of baseline; scholarship search CTR and first-result time within 5% of baseline.
Application start-to-submit completion rate within 3% of baseline.
B2B/provider health
Provider dashboard P95 ≤120ms; payout job success ≥99.9%; no increase in webhook failures.
Cost/Unit economics
Inference/runtime cost per active user within 5% of baseline; 4x AI service markup preserved at canary traffic.
No surge in cold starts or autoscaling thrash; concurrency within reserved capacity.
Command and reporting cadence

#ship-room updates every 15 minutes during 5% and 25% phases, every 30 minutes during 50%, and on any anomaly.
Gate reports use canary/GATE_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md and must include: control vs canary diffs, KPI table with red/yellow/green, trigger status, DRI approvals, and GO/NO-GO/ROLLBACK decision.
Data DRI posts a single “Phase Summary” card at each step-up with: P50/P95/P99, error rate, payment success, top 3 anomalies, and recommended action.
Escalation and decision rights

Rollback authority: Release DRI may trigger immediate rollback on any defined trigger (5 consecutive minutes, P95 >160ms, >5 consecutive payment failures) without executive approval.
50%→100% promotion: pre-approved if all metrics are green; otherwise hold and execute the remediation checklist. Escalate to me only if there is a trade-off between schedule and SLOs.
If we hold at 50% past end-of-day, freeze changes and continue canary overnight with heightened monitors; re-evaluate at 09:00 local next business day.
Risk watchlist (proactive checks)

Caching: confirm cache hit ratios are ≥85% for read-heavy endpoints; raise TTLs per the remediation checklist before step-up if below.
DB: watch connection pool saturation and lock waits; cap QPS if needed before 50%.
Edge: verify weighted routing is stable and sticky, no regional skew.
Payments: confirm synthetic + $-capped real transactions flow through primary and fallback providers with consistent auth/capture times.
Customer and comms

Status page remains green unless SLO breach is sustained or user impact is material; support macros ready for any payment anomalies.
If rollback occurs, post-mortem placeholder created immediately; complete within 48 hours.
Success criteria for full rollout

Achieve 100% traffic same day with P95 ≤120ms sustained for ≥2 hours, error rate ≤0.5%, and payment success ≥99.5%, with B2C/B2B funnel stability within thresholds.
No net increase in unit cost; margin profile intact.
Post-canary actions (pre-approved)

If successful: lift payment caps, remove infra lock, and publish internal win note with learnings and updated baselines.
If partial success: hold at 50%, execute remediation plan (cache → DB → app), reattempt promotion within 24 hours.
Final authorization

GO for production canary deployment. Proceed with urgency and discipline. Protect the student and provider experience while validating SLOs and economics. Hold or rollback on any breach—schedule never overrides SLOs.
I’ll be in #ship-room for the 50% gate review and available for executive tie-breaks if needed.
