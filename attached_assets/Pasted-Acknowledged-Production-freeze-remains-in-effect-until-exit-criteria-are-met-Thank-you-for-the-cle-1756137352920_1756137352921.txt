Acknowledged. Production freeze remains in effect until exit criteria are met. Thank you for the clean handoff and for aligning on ownership, sequencing, and CI/CD gates.

Executive directives and next milestones

Day 1 (Hour 0–24) – Critical closure and proof

Confirm by 6 PM:
eval() fully removed/banned in CI; 0 matches repo-wide and in built assets.
Secret scan (repo + dist) shows 0 findings; exposed keys rotated; CDN caches purged; evidence links posted.
/api/billing/balance locked behind auth+authorization; contract tests green.
SSR 500 fixed; scholarships listing returns 200/404 with integration tests.
Artifacts required:
Secret-rotation log, list of keys rotated, and validation that no server secrets are embedded client-side.
CI diffs showing new gates: eval ban, SQL string-concat ban, secret scanning.
Day 2 (Hour 24–48) – High-risk closure and guardrails

SQLi hardening complete (all template literals replaced with parameterized queries/Drizzle builders); negative tests added for injection attempts.
Async error handling in billing and storage complete (try/catch, rollback, transient retry).
CORS policy implemented with allowlisted origins and verified preflights.
Artifacts required:
SQLi test results and SAST report.
Fault-injection test results for DB/billing.
CORS policy doc and test logs.
Day 3 (Hour 48–72) – Validation, dashboards, and unblock review

Input validation limits live (bounds, negative values, oversized payloads) with correct 400/413 handling.
Transactions wrap complex writes; JWT edge-case tests added.
Redis-backed rate limiting in production config; metrics flowing.
Dashboards live: auth abuse (blocked attempts, FP rate), billing reconciliation deltas, endpoint contract health, SSR error rate, error budget and p95 latency.
72-hour Unfreeze Review (executive, DevOps, Backend, QA/Sec):
Critical: 0 open; High: 0 open; all verification tests green (rerun qa-comprehensive-execution-report.json).
Secret scanners clean; reconciliation deltas = $0; no SLO regression.
Operating cadence and controls

Stand-up: Daily 9:00 AM (15 min), blockers only.
EOD report: 6:00 PM, includes status vs plan, newly blocked attacks, error budget movement, and any SLO shifts.
Change control: All fixes behind flags; canary at 10% for 2 hours; auto-rollback if p95 +15% or 5xx +0.5% vs baseline.
Production policy: No deploy to full traffic until exit criteria pass and QA/Sec sign-off.
Strategic alignment

We are treating trust and security as core product features and prerequisites for growth and partner credibility, per our Playbook’s defense-in-depth mandate and 24/7 reliability posture .
The remediation process follows a disciplined, continuous testing approach to protect velocity after fixes, consistent with modern STLC/continuous testing guidance .
What I need next

DevOps: Post links to today’s first secret-scan results (repo + dist) and confirm Redis availability in staging/prod for rate limiting.
Backend: Confirm in staging that /api/billing/balance is now auth-protected and that SSR 500 is eliminated; share test IDs for verification.
QA/Sec: Queue the rerun of qa-comprehensive-execution-report.json for Hour ~68 and prepare canary validation checklist for unfreeze.
Data: Stand up the “Security & Reliability” dashboard set by Hour 36 and share read-only links.
Parallel execution with the Growth Sprint

Content/SEO work that doesn’t require code deploys may continue (page generation, content ops, sitemap/structured data prep). Any code changes remain behind the freeze.
Provider outreach and pricing/onboarding experiment design continue; launch is contingent on unfreeze.
I will personally chair the 72-hour Unfreeze Review. Until then, maintain the production freeze, execute decisively, and surface risks early.
