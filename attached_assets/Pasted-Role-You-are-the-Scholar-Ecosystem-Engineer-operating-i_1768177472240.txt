Role
You are the Scholar Ecosystem Engineer operating in Max Autonomous mode under CEO authority. Execute Sprint ZT3G-RERUN-005 (Final Integrity & Handoff). Your mission is to confirm A6 stays stable without republish (final anti-flap), maintain Stripe Safety Pause, lock in A1 warm performance, and generate the gold-standard artifact set with second confirmation. Post all telemetry/artifacts to A8 with checksum-verified round-trip.

Inputs
Gemini Executive Package (JSON):
[PASTE THE JSON OUTPUT FROM GEMINI HERE]

Run identifiers and headers

RUN_ID = CEOSPRINT-20260111-REPUBLISH-ZT3G-RERUN-005
Protocol: AGENT3_HANDSHAKE v27
X-Trace-Id = RUN_ID.<component> on all requests
X-Idempotency-Key on all mutable calls
CEO approvals and guardrails

A6 Final Gate (No-Touch): If A6 /health or /readyz ≠ 200 at any time, mark “A6 Regression Detected,” FAIL sprint, and escalate. Do not republish in this sprint.
Stripe Safety ENFORCED: Remaining ≈4 (<5). Pause all B2C charges. Only run a single $0.50 charge if a fresh HITL-CEO override is recorded for this sprint; auto-refund within 24h.
Reachability: All apps must bind to host=0.0.0.0 and return 200 on health routes.
Second-confirmation policy (anti–false-positive)

Any PASS requires at least 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3):
HTTP 200 with X-Trace-Id in payload
Matching X-Trace-Id in logs
Ledger correlation (A8 POST+GET checksum and/or Stripe/fee ledger)
Treat all prior states as Unconfirmed until re-verified now.
Phases (target ≤60 minutes; parallelize safely)
Phase -1: A6 Final Stability Gate (No-Touch)

Probe A6 /health and /readyz; expect 200 throughout. Capture P95/latency.
If non-200, FAIL sprint per policy (no republish). Record Git SHA and deploy timestamp in tests/perf/evidence/version_manifest.json.
Phase 0: Inventory & Strict A1 Warmup

Run 50 sequential warmup requests to A1 across /, /pricing, /browse, /health.
Immediately after warmup, probe A1 health (target ≤120ms). Begin 10-minute P95 sampling window.
Probe A2–A8 health; capture status, latency, uptime, binding; save tests/perf/reports/system_map.json and {app}_health.json.
Save tests/perf/reports/a1_warmup_report.md (cold vs warm).
Phase 1: A8 wiring and telemetry

Emit synthetic events with X-Trace-Id; require ≥99% acceptance and POST+GET checksum confirmation.
Save tests/perf/reports/a8_wiring_verdict.md.
Phase 2: RL + HITL

Verify RL: episode increments; exploration ≤0.001 or trending down; demonstrate a closed error-correction loop.
Record “Stripe Safety Pause Active” as HITL event; append tests/perf/reports/hitl_approvals.log.
Phase 3: A1 DB + Cookie (browser-grade)

After warmup, verify A1 P95 ≤120ms over 10 minutes.
Capture Set-Cookie; confirm SameSite=None; Secure.
Save tests/perf/reports/a1_cookie_validation.md.
Phase 4: A3 Orchestration (v1.4-Unified)

Run orchestration; confirm ≥1 for run_progress, cta_emitted, page_build_requested, page_published.
Provide X-Trace-Id; verify logs; correlate in A8; save tests/perf/reports/a3_orchestration_runlog.md.
Phase 5: B2C Funnel (Safety Mode)

If Stripe remaining <5 and no fresh HITL: SKIP live charge; set tests/perf/reports/b2c_flow_verdict.md = “Conditional Pass (Safety Pause).”
If fresh HITL: run one $0.50 micro-charge + refund with a browser-grade session (cookie jar); capture HTTP+Trace, logs, and Stripe ledger; save tests/perf/evidence/b2c_checkout_trace.json and tests/perf/evidence/refund_confirmations.json.
Phase 6: B2B Funnel (Final Verification)

Confirm A6 still 200; onboard provider and publish listing.
Verify 3% platform fee and 4x AI markup via fee lineage with X-Trace-Id and A8 ingestion.
Save tests/perf/evidence/fee_lineage.json and tests/perf/reports/b2b_flow_verdict.md.
Phase 7: Performance Sweep (SLO)

Collect 10-minute samples; compute P95 for /, /pricing, /browse and all app health routes.
Save tests/perf/reports/perf_summary.md.
Phase 8: SEO/A7

Verify ≥2,908 URLs reachable; validate sitemap/canonicals.
Trigger one new Auto Page Maker build; confirm A8 ingestion.
Save tests/perf/reports/seo_verdict.md.
Phase 9: Governance & Idempotency

Enforce idempotency; record canary rollout/coverage.
Save tests/perf/reports/idempotency_validation.md and tests/perf/reports/post_republish_diff.md.
Phase 10: Finalization & Gold-Standard Package

Generate tests/perf/evidence/checksums.json (SHA256 for all artifacts).
POST artifacts to A8 and confirm GET round-trip with checksum match.
Produce tests/perf/reports/go_no_go_report.md mapped to Gemini.acceptance_criteria.
Summarize 2-of-3 and 3-of-3 proofs in tests/perf/reports/ecosystem_double_confirm.md.
Acceptance criteria (all must PASS)

A6 health: 200 OK (no-touch stability) throughout sprint.
B2B: fee lineage (3% + 4x) verified with 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3) and A8 correlation.
B2C: “Conditional Pass (Safety Pause)” unless fresh HITL authorizes one micro-charge; if charged, require 2-of-3 (prefer 3-of-3).
A1: Warm probe ≤120ms and 10-minute P95 ≤120ms; cookie SameSite=None; Secure verified.
A8 telemetry: ≥99% with POST+GET checksum confirmation.
A1–A8: health routes 200; bound to 0.0.0.0; secrets validated.
SEO: ≥2,908 URLs reachable and at least one fresh A7 page build ingested.
RL: episode increments; exploration ≤0.001 (or decreasing); error-correction loop demonstrated.
Stripe safety: No charges with remaining <5 unless HITL override; immediate refunds if any micro-charge executed.
Stop/rollback rules

A6 non-200 at any time → mark UNVERIFIED and escalate with logs; no republish during this sprint.
Stripe remaining <5 and no fresh HITL → maintain Safety Pause; continue all non-billing verifications.
P95 >120ms persists >10 minutes post-warmup and one optimize attempt → open performance incident; continue remaining checks.

Final console output and A8 post

If all criteria pass under Safety Pause rules: print “Attestation: VERIFIED LIVE (ZT3G-RERUN-005)” and post artifact index with checksums; confirm A8 GET round-trip.
If A6 regresses or any critical criterion fails: print “Attestation: UNVERIFIED (ZT3G-RERUN-005)” and post a remediation plan listing failed checks, root-cause hypothesis, next action, owner, and ETA. END-REPLIT-AGENT-PROMPT
