Below is the Combined Master Orchestration Prompt for Agent3. It covers all eight apps in one prompt. Agent3 must strictly execute only the section that corresponds to the app in its current workspace. Do not work on any other app’s section.

Scope discipline and execution rules

Only execute the section for your app. Ignore all other sections.
Workspace self-check (mandatory, first step):
Identify your current workspace’s app by calling GET /health at your APP_BASE_URL.
If the app name returned does not match your section, do nothing else; generate a 1-page diagnostic report file: evidence/WORKSPACE_MISMATCH_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md Include: detected app name, APP_BASE_URL, expected app name for this section, why you cannot proceed, and what action the operator must take (open correct workspace).
Deliverables (for your app only):
evidence/EXEC_STATUS_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
evidence/E2E_REPORT_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
evidence/TEST_MATRIX_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
evidence/GO_DECISION_<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
evidence/SECTION<NUM>COMPLIANCE<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md (replace <NUM> with your section number below)
Required report headers (top of every report, first lines):
APP NAME: <your app name>
APP_BASE_URL: <your exact base URL>
“Today” objective:
Get your app to 100% production-ready and integrated with dependencies today. If not feasible, you must:
Provide ETA for go-live and ARR ignition (date you expect revenue contribution to begin).
List third-party systems and platform dependencies still needed and who owns them.
Acceptance criteria for all apps:
Endpoints: /health, /readyz, /version return successful responses.
P95 latency ≤120ms on core endpoints under nominal load.
99.9% uptime target with basic monitoring/alerting configured.
Security headers/CORS configured; no secrets leaked; basic rate limiting on public write endpoints.
Basic analytics/logging implemented (server logs and one analytics provider where applicable).
Integration smoke-tests with upstream/downstream apps pass (see section-specific requirements).
ARR/go-live expectations in GO_DECISION

State: GO or NO-GO for production today.
If NO-GO, provide:
ETA go-live date and prerequisites (by owner).
ARR ignition date (first revenue impact) and dependency list.
Provide ARR rationale for your app’s slice (e.g., projected conversions, ARPU or provider fee contribution). Use the platform’s current pricing model: 4x markup on AI services for B2C credits and 3% provider fee on B2B transactions. Use conservative, data-first assumptions.
Third-party systems menu (select only what you actually need)

Data: Managed PostgreSQL (primary), object storage (S3-compatible), search index (optional).
Messaging/Jobs: Redis/Queue (optional for background work).
Communications: Email provider (e.g., SendGrid), SMS provider (e.g., Twilio) if needed.
Payments: Stripe (or equivalent) for student credits and provider fees.
Monitoring: Sentry (or equivalent) and basic dashboards (uptime + latency).
Auth keys: JWKS hosted by scholar_auth, M2M credentials for service-to-service auth.
Analytics: GA4 (or equivalent) for web properties.
Integration map (reference)

scholar_auth authenticates students and providers; issues tokens/JWKS for other services.

student_pilot is the student-facing app; must link to auth, recommendations, and application flows.
provider_register onboards providers; syncs with scholarship_api and payments.

If NO-GO: precise ETA for go-live and ARR ignition; list unmet prerequisites and third-party systems required, with owners and dates.
If GO: cutover plan, rollback plan, on-call for first 72 hours.
SECTION<NUM>COMPLIANCE<app>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
Map each section requirement to evidence (file, endpoint, log snippet).

Execution start (what you do now)

Run workspace self-check:
Call GET /health at your APP_BASE_URL.
If app name doesn’t match your section, stop and produce WORKSPACE_MISMATCH report only.
If matched, implement/verify all section requirements for your app.
Produce all five required deliverables with the exact file names defined above, including the mandated header.
If you cannot reach 100% production readiness today, update GO_DECISION with:
NO-GO, earliest ETA date/time, ARR ignition date, and explicit third-party/platform dependencies with owners.
Integration smoke-tests:
Validate upstream/downstream handoffs noted in your section.
Record URLs, request/response examples, and timings in E2E_REPORT.
Finalize:
Confirm /health, /readyz, /version respond successfully.
Confirm security headers, CORS, and rate limiting are in place (where applicable).
Confirm analytics and logging are active.
Publish final GO_DECISION.
Important naming and formatting rules

No spaces in filenames. Use underscores.
Include today’s date in YYYYMMDD format.
The first two lines of every report must be: APP NAME: <your app name> APP_BASE_URL: <your base URL>
Decision cadence and escalation

If any dependency is blocking “today,” choose NO-GO and provide the exact action plan, owners, and dates. Do not wait.
Act with urgency but do not violate scope discipline.
End of prompt. Execute only your section.
