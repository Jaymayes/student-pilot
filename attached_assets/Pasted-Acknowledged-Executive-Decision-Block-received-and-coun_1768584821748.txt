Yes—I’m authorizing the SDR outreach sequence. Use the package below and instrument every touch via POST /oca/canary/day2/experiment/event-attributed with tags: source=SDR, experiment_id=exp_sdr_payouts_2026q1, variant={A|B}, step={1..8}, provider_id, meeting_booked={true|false}.

SDR sequence (Top 100 providers, fund size ≥$25k)

Cadence and targets

Daily per-rep: 60 targeted emails, 12 meaningful replies, 4 meetings booked.
Sequence length: 8 touches over 10 business days.
Primary KPI: meetings booked rate. Secondary: reply rate, meetings→onboard CVR.
Messaging variants

Variant A (Speed): “Instant Payout reliability” after account verification; 0 disputes to date; 99.5%+ Stripe health; 3% platform fee transparency; no black box AI—every match is verified.
Variant B (Control & Compliance): FERPA-first architecture, segregation of student vs school data, daily parity checks, auditability; plus same payout reliability language, secondary.
Touch plan

Day 0 Email 1 (A/B)
A Subject: Instant payouts for scholarship recipients (same-day after verification)
B Subject: FERPA-first payouts with full audit trail
Body (shared spine, personalize tokens {first_name}, {program_name}, {avg_award}, {state}): We help programs move from week-long disbursements to same-day payouts after verification, with a 3% platform fee and zero disputes to date. Your team keeps control: FERPA/COPPA safeguards, hourly ledger parity, and transparent AI that never bypasses human review. 15 minutes to see the activation flow and our Provider Activation Funnel (signup→payouts enabled). Open to a quick walkthrough this week? CTA: Book 15 minutes [link]. Compliance footer: Opt-out sentence and physical mailing address; do not imply guaranteed “instant” funds—clarify “after account verification.”
Day 1 LinkedIn connect + note
“We power verified, same-day disbursements for scholarships with FERPA-first controls. Happy to share the activation flow for {program_name}.”
Day 2 Email 2 (Proof)
“What to expect in 72 hours: account-link success ≥99.5%, median register→payouts ~1–3 minutes after verification, zero ledger deltas. Here’s the 5‑step go‑live checklist.” CTA to book.
Day 3 Call 1 + voicemail
Opener: “We help reduce payout friction and refunds for {program_name}. Same-day after verification, audit-ready. Worth 15 minutes to see if it fits your cycle?”
Qualify: # awards/year, average award, current payout rails, KYC/KYB vendor, cycle calendar, decision owner.
Day 5 Email 3 (ROI/ops)
“Ops calculator: your current cycle time vs same-day after verification. For ${fund_size}, 3% platform fee with hourly parity checks often replaces manual ops time and refund handling.” Include calculator screenshot or table; CTA.
Day 6 LinkedIn value post DM
“Sharing our Provider Activation Funnel metrics—happy to benchmark {program_name} privately.”
Day 8 Call 2
Objection handling:
“We already have a vendor.” → “We integrate with Stripe; keep existing rails. Our moat is FERPA segmentation + automated parity. Low‑lift pilot.”
“Compliance risk.” → “Daily log‑redaction sampling, no student PII in logs, clear audit artifacts. We’ll furnish a 2‑page compliance brief.”
Day 10 Breakup Email
“Should I close the loop? If timing isn’t right, I can circle back post‑cycle. Otherwise, here’s a 15‑minute slot to see the payout demo.”
Meeting script (for booked calls, 15 minutes)

Minute 0–3: Goal confirm; program size; current payout SLA; pain points.
Minute 3–8: Demo “Provider Activation Funnel” tile and parity checks; show Stripe health and dispute rate.
Minute 8–12: Implementation: 72‑hour activation, sandbox test, no lock‑in; fees; Responsible AI policy.
Minute 12–15: Close: pilot scope (one program, capped GMV), success criteria (same-day after verification rate, zero ledger deltas, provider NPS), next steps.
Required disclosures and guardrails

Always say “same-day after verification,” not “instant payout,” in writing.
Include opt-out language; honor opt-out within 24 hours.
No claims about guaranteed award decisions; we empower disbursement, not admissions/selection.
CRM and attribution fields to capture per touch

provider_id, fund_size_bucket, persona, current_rails, cycle_window, meeting_date, next_step, likelihood_%. Log each touch via /oca/canary/day2/experiment/event-attributed with verified_link where applicable.
Execution checklist for today

Growth/SEO: Submit sitemap now; confirm in 30 minutes. If pending, trigger fetch + add internal links from APM hub.
Product/Data: Add Provider Activation Funnel tile and GMV forecast vs cap tile to GET /oca/canary/day2/dashboard-tiles.
DevOps/SRE: Synthetic monitor at 30s cadence on provider endpoints; raise warn at P95>300ms for 5 min; auto-slow paid pushes.
Finance/Compliance: Add daily GMV forecast vs realized; continue log-redaction sampling; attach parity logs to the 24h readout.
If you approve, I’ll green‑light this SDR sequence and have the first 100 messages out within the hour, with attribution tags live and an interim meeting‑rate readout by EOD.
