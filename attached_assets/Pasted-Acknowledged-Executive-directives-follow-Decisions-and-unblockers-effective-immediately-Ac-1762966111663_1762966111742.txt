Decisions and unblockers (effective immediately)

Access to auto_com_center

Ops: provision Agent3 with Maintainer access to auto_com_center Replit within 10 minutes. Invite the same Agent3 account used across the portfolio. Confirm in-thread when done.
If not confirmed by T+10 min: escalate via on-call per runbook; classify as P1 “AUTO_COM_CENTER ACCESS.” Agent3 proceeds with API-only verification fallback until IDE access is granted.
Gate A (auto_com_center) 20:00–20:15 UTC

Purpose: final verification and evidence collection only. No new scope. Code freeze in effect unless a sev-1 defect is found.
Pass thresholds
Inbox placement: ≥95% primary inbox (target 100%)
P95 latency: ≤120 ms (target <100 ms)
Error rate: ≤0.10%
SPF/DKIM/DMARC: PASS (all sending domains)
Webhooks: 30K replay clean; zero loss/reorder; idempotency keys verified
Evidence required by 20:30 UTC
Headers, screenshots, latency histograms; webhook logs; request_id traces; SHA-256 manifest
If any metric fails
Immediate actions: route to secondary pool with reduced throttles, extend warm-up by 7–14 days, hold all outbound sends from scholarship_agent, and open a sev-2 to remediate. Re-run Gate A within 24 hours.
Gate B (provider_register) 18:00–18:15 UTC; decision by 18:20 UTC

PASS criteria
Auth via scholar_auth with RBAC; E2E onboarding functional
3% platform fee deterministic, auditable; dry-run settlement success
Webhooks/APIs operational; request_id lineage intact
P95 ≤120 ms; error rate <0.10%; audit logs enabled
If FAIL: provide remediation ETA and confirm no impact to Gate A/C timelines.
Gate C (scholar_auth) 20:00–20:15 UTC

PASS criteria
MFA enforced; OIDC SSO verified
Token/session security validated (short-lived tokens; secure refresh; rotation)
P95 ≤120 ms; error ≤0.10%
Audit logging confirmed; RBAC matrix sample; OIDC discovery doc
If FAIL: freeze all dependent feature releases; execute rollback plan; re-run within 24 hours.
Legal sign-off (student_pilot)

Deadline: 18:00 UTC today for ToS/Privacy/COPPA language. No outbound comms to minors until signed. Under-13 hard block remains enforced.
If delayed: student_pilot remains “Delayed—Compliance Hold.” Next target launch: Nov 14, 16:00 UTC. Feature flags retained.
scholarship_agent (Observer Mode)

Remains live in Observer Mode; sends locked until Gate A + Gate C PASS and Legal sign-off. Prepare day-1 warm-up cohorts and suppression lists; no sends without explicit CEO greenlight post-20:45 review.
Reporting cadence

18:20 UTC: Gate B PASS/FAIL with evidence summary
20:45 UTC: Gate A/C consolidated summary (GREEN/YELLOW/RED) + recommendation
23:00 UTC: Full package to scholarship_sage including Gate A/B/C results, auto_page_maker canary, KPI rollups, audit trails, SHA-256 manifest
KPI oversight for tonight

Technical SLOs (all apps): uptime ≥99.9%; P95 ≤120 ms; error rate ≤0.10%; zero sev-1s
Deliverability (auto_com_center): inbox ≥95%; spam <0.5%; bounce <2%
Auth (scholar_auth): successful OIDC handshakes ≥99.5%; MFA opt-in ≥90% where applicable
B2C readiness (student_pilot): activation telemetry streaming; checkout dry-run success; ARPU assumptions unchanged
B2B readiness (provider_register): 3% fee capture verified; test invoice/settlement complete
Risk register and mitigations

Legal delay: maintain compliance hold; reslot launch to Nov 14 if not signed by 18:00 UTC
Deliverability variance: if inbox <95%, extend warm-up and reduce daily volume; do not authorize sends
Auth SLO breach: freeze feature flags, rollback to last green build; re-run Gate C within 24 hours
SEO canary (auto_page_maker): run 22:15 UTC; if quality drops, rollback canaries and apply 301s to prevent thin-content exposure
ARR and growth posture

ARR ignition remains Nov 13–15 for B2C credit sales (4x AI markup) contingent on Legal + Gate A/C PASS.
scholarship_agent email-driven ARR contribution deferred until warm-up completion (ETA Dec 4+).
Maintain 3% provider fee and focus on organic acquisition via auto_page_maker; no paid channels authorized for this phase.
Directives to Agent3

Proceed to auto_com_center workspace now for Gate A preparation. If access not confirmed by T+10 minutes, execute the API-only verification fallback and keep pressing Ops until access is granted.
Maintain critical-window discipline: 19:45–20:30 UTC reserved for Gate A. No context switching.
Use your prepared checklists/templates. Ship the 20:45 and 23:00 packages on time.
I will personally review the 20:45 UTC summary and issue the final go/no-go for sends and student_pilot launch timing. Stay on plan and escalate immediately on any red conditions.
