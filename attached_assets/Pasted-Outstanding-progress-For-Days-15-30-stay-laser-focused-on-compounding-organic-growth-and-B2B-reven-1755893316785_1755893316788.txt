Outstanding progress. For Days 15–30, stay laser-focused on compounding organic growth and B2B revenue readiness while hardening data trust and measurable matching lift. Priorities by squad below, with concrete targets and decision gates.

SEO squad (primary growth lever)

Scale and quality
Publish 700–800 additional programmatic pages to reach ≥1,000 total; maintain clean URL patterns, canonical tags, schema.org, and XML sitemaps.
Enforce Core Web Vitals budgets (LCP ≤2.5s, INP ≤200ms, CLS ≤0.1) with prerender/caching rules.
Attribution and indexation
Search Console: validate index coverage ≥85% across page clusters; set alerts for coverage drops.
Attribute signups to page clusters; target ≥10% of new signups from organic programmatic pages by Day 30, aligned to the playbook’s low-CAC, SEO-first funnel .
Decision gate (Day 30): 1,000+ pages live and indexable; ≥10% organic signup attribution trending up .
Marketplace integration (B2C interfaces)

Pilot to production (limited)
Move promotions from staging to production behind flags for a limited cohort; keep entitlement gating and E2E attribution.
Run two pricing experiments (listing/promotion fees vs. recruitment dashboard access) with guardrails; ensure event parity from click to partner deep link.
Targets
≥5 live partner promotions; validated attribution events; prepare pipeline toward the Year‑2 pilot scale (10–15 partners) per the playbook’s roadmap .
Decision gate (Day 30): “go” for open pilot if CTR and attribution reliability meet thresholds; share early signal for monetization motions that map to marketplace revenue streams (listings/promotion, recruitment access, analytics) .
Data consumption and trust

Coverage and freshness
Maintain median freshness ≤72 hours; expand reflected source coverage toward ≥70% of priority feeds.
Quality and UX
Enforce read-side schemas (eligibility, materials, deadlines, essay themes); keep freshness/quality indicators visible; log completeness thresholds and alert breaches.
Why it matters: reliable eligibility/materials/deadlines power the concierge experience and are mandated by the playbook’s ingestion/normalization guidance .
Decision gate (Day 30): SLA sustained, coverage trending to ≥70%, no critical schema drift.
Matching UX and experimentation

Scale experiment and transparency
Keep the A/B test running until stat-sig; expand explanation UI to consistently expose explicit eligibility, implicit fit, and competition signals; continue logging feature importances.
Add fairness/ethics checks to the analysis readout; ensure copy upholds “assistant, not writer” positioning.
Targets
Preserve or improve the current +29.8% conversion lift; confirm significance and publish a decision memo.
Alignment: follows the playbook’s predictive matching blueprint and ethical assistant posture (not a ghostwriter) .
Monetization hygiene (cross-squad)

Maintain credit pack transparency with 4x markup and per-model pricing visibility; confirm receipts/meters are accurate end-to-end per the playbook’s pricing guidance .
Security, privacy, and resilience (ongoing)

Keep defense-in-depth: strict input validation/allow-lists, least privilege, encryption in transit/at rest, WAF/CDN controls; document any new data flows from SEO or partner surfaces.
Prep for formal audits in line with the playbook’s roadmap (security audit in Year 2; aim for zero regressions as traffic scales) .
KPIs for weekly executive review (Days 15–30)

SEO: total pages live, index coverage, impressions, CTR, and organic signup share (goal ≥10%) .
Marketplace: count of live promotions (goal ≥5), attribution reliability, CTR to partner deep links; pilot readiness toward 10–15 partners in line with Year‑2 goals .
Data: freshness SLA compliance, source coverage toward ≥70%, schema completeness.
Matching: apply CTR and profile→application conversion lift; explanation exposure rates and fairness checks.
AI economics: per-use margin at or above 4x markup; latency adherence by model tier .
Unblockers needed this week

Approve production pilot cohort for partner promotions (feature flags, traffic allocation).
Confirm SEO content governance (templates, editorial standards) to keep scale without brand risk, consistent with the playbook’s organic-first mandate .
Validate legal/consent copy for new data indicators and attribution flows (privacy posture per playbook) .
If you want to over-invest anywhere this sprint, prioritize: 1) throughput and indexation quality on SEO (fastest compounding low-CAC growth) ; 2) rock-solid marketplace attribution in production (longest lead-time for B2B revenue scale) .
