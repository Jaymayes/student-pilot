Acknowledged. Executive GO is approved and authority is transferred to SRE/Platform under the stated guardrails. Proceed with urgency and discipline.

Immediate asks for SRE/Platform (timeboxed)
Within 30 minutes

Acknowledge in #ship-room.
Propose the UTC canary window at the lowest 7‑day RPS trough (prefer west-coast traffic if tied).
Post DRI roster with on-call escalation path and time zones.
Post dashboard links for: latency/errors, payments, cache/CDN, DB, infra saturation, and cost per request/AI markup.
Confirm payment caps are enforced (100 tx, $20 max/tx, $1,500 total).
Within 60 minutes

Confirm security sign-off timing.
Confirm all dashboard URLs resolve for the CEO and SRE leads.
Confirm synthetic monitors green and targeting the canary slice.
At T‑10

Execute 5 x $1 live payment transactions; post results (auth/capture, fraud/limit rule outcomes, masked txn IDs).
Verify PITR snapshot exists and post the restore pointer.
Stage CDN/API pre-warm set; be ready to report hit ratio in the first 10 minutes after T‑0.
At T‑0

Tag release vYYYYMMDD.X with commit SHA; link CEO_FINAL_DIRECTIVE.md and HANDOFF_SUMMARY.md in the change record.
Pre-warm CDN/cache for top SEO pages and API routes; report cache hit ratio after 10 minutes.
Execute the canary and begin 15‑minute reporting cadence.
Canary ramp plan and gates

Ramp: 1% (15m) → 10% (15m) → 25% (15m) → 50% (30m) → 100%.
Auto-approve 50%→100% only if: P95 ≤120ms and all gates GREEN.
CEO attends the 50% gate review live in #ship-room.
Disagreement on GO/NO-GO: IC may pause; SRE lead + CEO resolve within 5 minutes.
Reporting cadence (every 15 minutes in #ship-room)

Latency: P50/P95/P99 vs control; error rate.
Payments: E2E success ≥99.5%, declines/fraud flags.
Cache/CDN: hit ratio ≥85%, origin RPS.
DB: CPU/IO/utilization, connections; keep ≤80% to avoid spillover risk.
Unit economics: cost per user vs control, 4x AI markup intact.
Synthetic monitors: pass/fail and response schema checks.
Any yellow/red flags, plus margin deviations >3% (tag CEO).
Rollback triggers (execute immediately, no exec approval required)

Any SLO breach persisting 15 minutes.
Any PII risk.
Cost/user >5% over control or 4x markup erosion.
Payments E2E <99.5%.
Cache hit <85% with user-visible latency.
DB saturation >80% with spillover risk.
CEO involvement and policy

Live for the 50% gate review; available for executive tie-breaks during the window.
Tag the CEO on any YELLOW/RED alerts or >3% margin deviation.
Post-success (pre-approved)

After ≥2 hours stable at 100%: lift payment caps, remove infra lock, publish internal win note (lessons + KPI deltas), open 7‑day cohort review (funnels, ARPU, conversion, unit economics), maintain the 24‑hour non-critical change freeze.
Key risks to watch and mitigations

Cache regression: If hit <85%, expand pre‑warm set, tune TTL, and cap origin concurrency; report impact after 10 minutes.
Payments false positives: If fraud rules trip, document rule and rate; do not relax thresholds without explicit SRE lead + CEO concurrence during canary.
Cost/model drift: If markup pressure appears, validate model routing and token profile against control; fall back to cheaper route if needed to preserve 4x markup.
Final directive

GO for canary within the next 24 hours at the proposed RPS trough. Proceed with urgency and discipline.
Please confirm: proposed UTC start time, DRI roster, and dashboard links in #ship-room within 30 minutes.
