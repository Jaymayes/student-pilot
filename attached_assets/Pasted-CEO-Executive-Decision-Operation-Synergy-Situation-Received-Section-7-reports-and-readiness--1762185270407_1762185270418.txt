CEO Executive Decision — Operation Synergy

Situation

Received Section 7 reports and readiness updates from: scholar_auth, scholarship_api, scholarship_sage, scholarship_agent, auto_page_maker. auto_com_center is staged for DRY-RUN. student_pilot and provider_register have dependency blockers tied to auth configuration.
Critical blocker: student_pilot E2E failed with invalid_client. This contradicts “Auth GREEN.” Root cause is missing/incorrect OIDC client registration and outstanding provider_register AUTH_ISSUER_URL secret update.
CEO Decisions and Directives (effective immediately)

Unblock Authentication (hard gate for FOC)
Owner: Auth DRI
Deadline: T+30 minutes
Actions (must all be completed and evidenced):
Register OIDC client: student-pilot
client_id: student-pilot
redirect_uris: [https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/api/callback]
grant_types: [authorization_code, refresh_token]
response_types: [code]
scopes: [openid, email, profile, roles, offline_access]
PKCE: S256 enforced
token_endpoint_auth_method: client_secret_post
Confirm provider_register client exists and matches production redirect URIs; rotate secrets if needed.
Publish proof bundle: discovery (200), JWKS KID, client registry entry, successful end-to-end auth for student-pilot and provider_register (screenshots or HAR), and one decoded JWT with roles claim (redacted).
Exit criteria: student_pilot E2E can obtain code, exchange for tokens, refresh token rotates; provider_register can complete auth handshake.
2. Fix provider_register secret

Owner: Provider Register Operator
Deadline: T+15 minutes
Action: Update AUTH_ISSUER_URL to https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app and restart. Post screenshot and one successful login round trip with role=Provider.
Exit criteria: 1 successful login; 401/403 negative tests enforced.
3. Resume student_pilot E2E immediately after Auth GREEN

Owner: Frontend DRI (student_pilot)
Deadline: Start T+0 after Auth DRI greenlight; complete within T+120
Acceptance gates:
Auth success rate ≥98%
P95 ≤120 ms across top 5 page loads and key API calls
Zero critical 5xx
RBAC isolation verified; standardized JSON errors with request_id
Evidence: HAR files, latency P50/P95/P99, screenshots, 401/403 negative tests.
4. Execute auto_com_center 5× DRY-RUN upon infra green signal

Owner: Comms DRI
Deadline: Within 2 hours of “GREEN - Canary Stable”
Acceptance gates:
≥99% delivery success
Zero DLQ growth; auto-rollback armed
Opt-out/unsubscribe < 5 seconds
CAN-SPAM/GDPR/FERPA checks pass
Evidence bundle: pre-staged artifacts + SHA256 manifest.
5. Maintain Freeze Discipline

Owners: All DRIs
Only allowed changes: client registration, secret updates, and non-breaking configuration to remove blockers. No API/schema or logic changes until FOC Go/No-Go.
Operational Timeline (from now)

T+00–T+15: provider_register secret fix
T+00–T+30: Auth DRI completes and evidences OIDC client registration(s)
T+30–T+150: student_pilot E2E run and evidence submission
T+150–T+270: provider_register E2E run and evidence submission
T+270–T+390: auto_com_center 5× DRY-RUN and evidence submission
T+390: CEO Go/No-Go meeting; decision posted immediately after evidence review
Readiness Board (current view)

scholar_auth: Conditionally GREEN pending proof of client registration; JWKS/discovery reported OK.
scholarship_api: GREEN, P95 ~111ms, RBAC and error standards verified.
scholarship_sage: GREEN, P95 ~1ms, FROZEN.
scholarship_agent: GREEN, FROZEN; ready to generate event volume.
auto_page_maker: GREEN, FROZEN; SEO DRY-RUN complete; manual GSC steps queued.
auto_com_center: HOLD pending canary stabilization; DRY-RUN kit ready.
student_pilot: NOT READY due to auth dependency; resumes post-auth fix.
provider_register: CONDITIONAL READY pending AUTH_ISSUER_URL update.
Revenue and KPI Rationale for Priority

B2C engine (student_pilot) is our primary conversion path; auth blockage directly suppresses ARPU and delays credit sales. Unblocking auth/E2E is top priority to protect near-term revenue targets.
B2B engine (provider_register) drives 3% platform fee; secret fix is a fast, high-ROI unblock.
auto_page_maker fuels CAC reduction via SEO at scale; technical pass is good, proceed with GSC submission to start compounding impressions.
auto_com_center drives activation and retention nudges; DRY-RUN must validate reliability to avoid churn risk at scale.
Risk Register (with mitigations)

Auth misalignment risk: invalid_client persists. Mitigation: CEO-enforced 30-minute SLA, proof artifacts mandatory, war-room channel opened until green.
E2E slippage: If student_pilot fails acceptance gates, fallback to focused remediation sprints (auth/session handling, caching, lazy-load), with a 24-hour retest window.
Comms heap pressure: If canary re-fails, reduce event rate by 30% and shard queues; DRY-RUN proceeds in staged ramps (10%/25%/50%/75%/100%).
Deliverables Required Before Go/No-Go

Auth DRI: Client registration evidence bundle and GREEN signal.
student_pilot DRI: Section 7 report with lifecycle window (3–4 years) and E2E pass evidence.
provider_register DRI: Final Section 7 report already submitted; add E2E pass evidence post-secret update.
auto_com_center DRI: DRY-RUN evidence with binary PASS/FAIL and compliance checks.
Accountability

If Auth GREEN is not achieved within 30 minutes, I will authorize a temporary, tightly scoped fallback client for student_pilot to complete E2E, followed by immediate post-E2E rotation. This is a last-resort option and must be accompanied by an audit entry and rotation within 2 hours.
Next Update Cadence

DRIs post status at T+15, T+30, and then hourly until Go/No-Go.
I will issue the final Go/No-Go immediately upon receipt and review of all evidence bundles.
Act with urgency and precision. Student value is business value; unblocking friction in authentication and E2E flows is the fastest path to revenue and market leadership.
