To: Replit Agent3Role: QA Automation LeadSubject: Execution Mandate: Comprehensive E2E System Validation and Readiness Assessment (READ-ONLY)ObjectiveYou are tasked with executing a full End-to-End (E2E) test sweep across the entire system architecture. This includes the Frontend application, Backend services, and the connectivity/integration with all eight (8) external applications. The goal is to validate system stability, functionality, and deployment readiness.CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: READ-ONLY OPERATIONTHIS IS STRICTLY A READ-ONLY AND OBSERVATIONAL TASK. You are prohibited from making any changes to the codebase, environment variables, configuration files, or database state.DO NOT attempt remediation or bug fixes if failures are encountered.If any automated test attempts to perform destructive actions (e.g., DELETE, UPDATE on critical data), ensure the test is configured to run in a non-destructive mode, or skip the test and flag it in the report.Your sole purpose is to execute, observe, and report.System Under Test (SUT) ScopeFrontend: The primary user interface.Backend: Core services, APIs, and database interactions.Integrations: Eight (8) external applications (App 1 through App 8).E2E Test Execution Plan1. Environment Verification (Read-Only)Verify access to the designated E2E testing environment.Confirm that all components (Frontend, Backend, and external dependencies) are accessible and running the expected versions.Initialize test runners and monitoring tools without altering the SUT.2. Frontend E2E TestingExecute the complete suite of automated UI tests.Validate all critical user journeys (e.g., Authentication, Core Functionality, Data Retrieval, Reporting).Verify component rendering, responsiveness, and interaction behavior.Monitor and report any client-side errors (console errors), failed assertions, or visual anomalies.3. Backend E2E TestingExecute the complete API integration test suite.Validate all API endpoints for functionality, correct HTTP response codes, schema adherence, and error handling.Verify the execution of core business logic and data processing tasks.Assess performance metrics (response times, latency) during execution.4. Integration and Connectivity Testing (8 Apps)For each of the eight integrated applications:Validate connectivity and successful authentication/authorization handshake.Test the data exchange protocols (inbound and outbound) between the Backend and the external app.Verify the system's handling of responses (success and failure scenarios) from these external services.Report any connection timeouts, authentication failures, or data discrepancies.Deliverable: E2E Findings and Readiness ReportPlease compile a comprehensive report detailing all observations. The report must include the following sections:A. Executive SummaryOverall system health status (e.g., Green, Yellow, Red).Deployment Readiness Assessment (Go / No-Go), based strictly on the test results.Summary of critical blockers encountered.B. Test Execution SummaryTotal Tests Executed.Pass Rate (%).Summary of tests Skipped (including reasons, e.g., required destructive action).C. Detailed Findings: FrontendPass/Fail status for critical user journeys.Detailed descriptions of any failures, including affected components, error logs, and associated test case IDs.D. Detailed Findings: BackendAPI health overview and performance metrics.Detailed descriptions of any service failures, including the endpoint, the nature of the failure (e.g., timeout, incorrect response), and relevant logs.E.
