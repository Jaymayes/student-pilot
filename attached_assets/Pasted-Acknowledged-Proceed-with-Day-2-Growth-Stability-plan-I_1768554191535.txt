Acknowledged. Proceed with Day‑2 Growth & Stability plan.

Immediate, time‑boxed orders

Growth/Marketing (now)
• Keep A/B test running as configured; freeze creative until winner is declared (95% conf, 300 verified links).
• Launch SDR sequence to waitlist + top 100 targets today.
• Ship 50 Auto Page Maker provider pages by EOD+1; submit sitemap to Search Console.
• Guardrail: if any provider endpoint P95 > 350 ms for 10 consecutive minutes, pause paid pushes and page me.

Product/Data (within 2 hours)
• Dashboard tiles live: Providers Onboarded/Hour (topline), Signup CVR by variant with confidence band, Account‑link success, Median register→payouts, Endpoint P95s, Stripe probe success, Ledger parity.
• Attribution tags: source, experiment_id, variant, verified_link, time_to_payouts_enabled.

DevOps/SRE (within 24 hours)
• Merge 5s telemetry sampling + regression tests; attach PR link and test run to A8.
• Day‑2 sentinels live: container RSS drift >10% in 60 minutes → page; Stripe rate‑limit remaining <20% → warn.
• Maintain GMV cap $100k; prep auto‑package for the T+60 review.

Finance Ops (hourly today; 24h readout tomorrow AM)
• Hourly parity checks + disputes watch; attach logs to A8.
• Prepare 24‑hour Business Readout: providers/hour vs baseline (+10% target), time‑to‑first‑payout, GMV and 3% fee, exceptions (expect 0), rate‑limit/circuit events (expect 0), FERPA/COPPA sample.

Compliance (daily for 7 days)
• Log‑redaction sampling and weekly trend tile; flag any variance immediately.

Decision gates

T+60 GMV cap review ($100k → $250k): approve only if last 10 heartbeats green, P95 ≤ 350 ms, error ≤ 0.2%, DLQ=0, compute ≤ 1.4x, Stripe ≥ 99.5%, ledger delta = $0.00. Otherwise hold.
24‑hour Business Readout: decide on messaging scale‑up and next GMV cap step.
Stop rules (no exceptions)

Any ledger delta > $0.00, DLQ > 0, backlog > 30, Stripe < 99.5%, error ≥ 1.0%, P95 ≥ 1.5 s → immediate rollback + page CEO.
Reporting cadence I expect

T+60 GMV review package (auto‑generated).
EOD note: A/B sample size, interim uplift and confidence, any alerts, SDR activity.
24‑hour Business Readout with the KPI set above.
This is the pivot from safety to capitalization. Execute and keep me paged on any breach; otherwise see you at the T+60 checkpoint.
