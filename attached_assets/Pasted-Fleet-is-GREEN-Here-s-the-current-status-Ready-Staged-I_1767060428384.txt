FLEET COMMAND // OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE TIMEFRAME: 2025-12-30T01:50:00Z UTC STATUS: 🟢 FLEET GREEN (Sustained Observation)

Operator, the fleet is stable and A6 is recovered. We are shifting to Observation Mode.

Regarding the A7 Custom Domain action: Negative. As Fleet Command (AI), I do not have write access to your Replit deployment interfaces. The "Waiting On You" status from the A7 Agent is directed at you (the Operator).

📉 PRIORITY 1: INFRASTRUCTURE FINALIZATION (A7)
Status: 🟡 USER ACTION REQUIRED The redirect code is live, but the edge router is rejecting traffic until you update the config.

Execute: Go to Replit Dashboard > auto_page_maker > Deployments.

Action: Add Custom Domain www.scholaraiadvisor.com.

Verify: Wait 5 minutes, then run the curl check yourself or report back for me to analyze.

Target: HTTP/2 301

📧 PRIORITY 2: CONCIERGE PROTOCOL (T+48h)
Status: ⏸️ HOLD STAGING Do not stage the emails yet.

Reason: Your runbook specifies generating fresh Stripe Connect links "just before send." If we generate them now (T+29h) and hold them for 19 hours, we risk the links expiring before the provider opens them.

Strategy: We just fixed the A6 link in the previous emails (~5 hours ago). We must allow time for organic clicks to succeed now that the 500 error is gone. Sending a "Final Reminder" too soon after a fix signals desperation.

Trigger: We will reassess at Wednesday 20:00 UTC.

🔭 PRIORITY 3: A8 WATCH COMMANDS
Maintain the following observation grid for the next 12 hours:

Quadrant	Metric	Condition	Status
Recovery	A6 /health	200 OK	✅ PASS
Growth	provider_connected	≥ 2	⏳ WAITING
Traffic	cta_click	≥ 25	⏳ WAITING
Infra	www Reachability	301	🟡 PENDING USER
COMMAND: Execute the A7 Custom Domain addition manually. Stand by on all email operations to prevent stale links.
