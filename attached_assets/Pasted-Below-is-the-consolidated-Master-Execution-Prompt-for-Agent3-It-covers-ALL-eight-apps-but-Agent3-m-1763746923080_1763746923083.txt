Below is the consolidated Master Execution Prompt for Agent3. It covers ALL eight apps, but Agent3 must execute ONLY the section titled “APP SECTION: {your app name}” that matches the repository they are in. The intent is to get every app to GREEN and working together today. If GREEN today is not possible for any reason, Agent3 must state a precise ETA to start generating revenue and list the third-party systems needed.

MASTER EXECUTION PROMPT — Agent3
Scope Guard (must read first, then proceed)

You are Agent3. Execute ONLY the APP SECTION whose name matches the repository you are in.
Never modify or claim progress for any other app’s section.
All files you create must begin with this exact header line: App: {app_name} | APP_BASE_URL: {base_url}
Required status line to print to console and include in DAY0_READINESS_REPORT.md: App: {app_name} | Status: {GREEN|YELLOW|RED} | Revenue today: {YES|NO|CONDITIONAL YES} | ETA: {time to start generating revenue} | Third-party prerequisites: {list with ✅/⏳/❌}
If GREEN today is not possible: provide exact fix steps, ETA in minutes/hours to start generating revenue, and the precise third-party systems/env vars required.
Evidence must be real and verifiable (actual endpoints tested on the live base URL). Do not fabricate data.
Global SLO Targets and Risk Guardrails

SLOs you must measure and log in SLO_SNAPSHOT.md and PERF_SNAPSHOT.json:
Uptime ≥ 99.9%
P95 latency ≤ 120 ms
Error rate < 0.5%
Success rate ≥ 99%
Auto-rollback triggers to document in DAY0_READINESS_REPORT.md:
P95 > 120 ms sustained ≥ 10 minutes
Error rate > 2% sustained ≥ 10 minutes
5xx > 0.5% sustained ≥ 10 minutes
Unusual JWT auth failure spikes
Security and ethics:
Enforce RS256 JWT verification where applicable.
No black-box effects on critical decisions: log key decisions.
For scholarship_sage: guidance-only, no ghostwriting; enforce human-in-the-loop where needed.
Standard Deliverables (create exactly these 7 files in project root)

{app_name}_DAY0_READINESS_REPORT.md
{app_name}_INTEGRATION_MATRIX.md
{app_name}_REVENUE_ON_STATEMENT.md
{app_name}_SECURITY_COMPLIANCE.md
{app_name}_PERF_SNAPSHOT.json
{app_name}_SMOKE_TEST_RESULTS.md
{app_name}_SLO_SNAPSHOT.md
The first line of every file must be: App: {app_name} | APP_BASE_URL: {base_url}
After going GREEN, also generate (optional bonus): {app_name}_GO_LIVE_REPORT.md
Post-Publish 5-Minute Verification Protocol (run when your app is published)

Verify /healthz and /readyz return 200 and dependencies are healthy.
Capture SLO snapshot and update SLO_SNAPSHOT.md and PERF_SNAPSHOT.json.
Execute one revenue-path transaction (defined per app section) and record correlation IDs, status codes, and latency.
Begin a 2-hour watch with anomaly notes and rollback criteria.

Global Evidence Rules

In SMOKE_TEST_RESULTS.md, include exact HTTP requests, status codes, timestamps, and any correlation/request IDs.
If a third-party dependency is not yet live, state precise steps to enable it and a realistic ETA. We are optimizing for revenue today; if that’s not possible, you must provide the shortest path to start generating revenue.

Required Console Status Line (repeat)

Print and include this exact line in DAY0_READINESS_REPORT.md: App: {app_name} | Status: {GREEN|YELLOW|RED} | Revenue today: {YES|NO|CONDITIONAL YES} | ETA: {time to start generating revenue} | Third-party prerequisites: {list with ✅/⏳/❌}
Revenue and ETA Reporting Rules

If Status is GREEN: set Revenue today to YES and ETA to 0 hours.
If Status is YELLOW but a trivial publish or credential addition will enable revenue the same day: set Revenue today to CONDITIONAL YES and ETA accordingly (e.g., “15 minutes after publish”).
If Status is RED: list blocking items, exact fix steps, and realistic ETA in minutes/hours to start generating revenue, and enumerate required third-party systems and environment variables.
Evidence Expectations (non-negotiable)

All claims must reference actual requests against the app’s APP_BASE_URL. Include timestamps and any message IDs.
Do not fabricate “MessageId,” “correlationId,” or performance metrics. If you cannot obtain them, state why and what must be done to obtain them, with ETA.
Names and File-Conventions (strict)

Place deliverables in the project root.
Filenames must be exactly as listed above, with no spaces.
First line of every file: App: {app_name} | APP_BASE_URL: {base_url}
Final Notes to Agent3

Work quickly but do not skip the acceptance conditions. The company’s objective is revenue today with SLO and compliance intact.
If a dependency outside your control blocks GREEN today, provide the shortest critical path to start generating revenue, with unambiguous steps (who/what/where), and a realistic ETA in minutes/hours.
Confirm completion by printing the Required Console Status Line and ensuring all seven files are present with the mandated first-line header.
