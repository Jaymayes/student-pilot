APPLICATION IDENTIFICATION
Application Name: student_pilot
APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Application Type: User Facing

TASK COMPLETION STATUS

Task 4.5.1 (Authentication Flow): In Progress/Blocked - OIDC flow implemented and configured to use scholar_auth with authorization_code + refresh_token and secure token storage; awaiting production OIDC client registration + HAR evidence to validate end-to-end (login → redirect → callback → session → logout). HttpOnly cookie path and CSRF protections pre-configured.
Task 4.5.2 (Feature Functionality): In Progress - Core features built and staged for E2E: Dashboard, profile CRUD, scholarship search (via scholarship_api), application creation and status tracking. Validation, error handling, and standardized JSON parsing implemented. E2E execution is blocked on Task 4.5.1.
Task 4.5.3 (Sage Integration): In Progress - UI is wired to a configurable recommendation endpoint with JWT+scope requirements. Final endpoint selection pending CEO decision (scholarship_sage vs scholarship_api path). Live verification requires valid tokens (blocked on Task 4.5.1).
Task 4.5.4 (Responsiveness and UX): In Progress - Responsive layout verified across common breakpoints. Lighthouse automation prepared with Accessibility ≥90 target. WCAG testing checklist queued for E2E run. Keyboard navigation and focus states implemented; alt-text and ARIA roles reviewed.
INTEGRATION VERIFICATION

Connection with scholar_auth: Pending - App configured for OIDC (issuer, client_id, scopes incl. offline_access). Will validate via production HAR capture (auth code + token exchange) immediately upon client registration.
Connection with scholarship_api: Ready/Pending Evidence - API client and schema integrated; search and application flows instrumented. Will collect 30-sample latency, status codes, and standardized error payloads during E2E.
Connection with scholarship_sage: Pending - UI consumes a configurable recommendations endpoint; live verification contingent on final endpoint decision and valid JWT scope. Fallback path via scholarship_api is prepared behind a feature flag.
Connection with auto_com_center: N/A for direct calls - student_pilot does not originate sends; relies on event-driven comms from backend services. Unsubscribe and compliance UX links are present where surfaced.
Security Headers (6/6): Pending Evidence - App-level headers configured at edge; will dump and attach during E2E run.
P95 Latency (ms): To be measured - Will capture ≥30-sample distribution (P50/P95/P99) across key routes during E2E; target ≤120ms P95.
LIFECYCLE AND REVENUE CESSATION ANALYSIS

Estimated Revenue Cessation/Obsolescence Date: Q2 2029
Rationale: User-facing application with a 3–4 year modernization cadence. Drivers: evolving accessibility standards (WCAG 2.2/3.0), front-end framework shifts (React/Next major upgrades), rapid expectations for AI-assisted UX, and the need to integrate narrative-aware matching signals into the flow to sustain conversion. Emerging product insights indicate tighter fusion of essay/NLP signals with recommendations, likely necessitating UX redesign within the 36–48 month window to maintain B2C growth.
Contingencies:
Accelerate (Q4 2027–Q1 2028): Major a11y mandate, security-critical dependency EOL, or competitive displacement by AI-native UX patterns.
Extend (Q4 2029–Q1 2030): Strong conversion metrics, low churn, incremental design system updates, and modular UI enabling piecewise modernization.
OPERATIONAL READINESS DECLARATION
NOT READY for FOC

Ready for B2C DRY-RUN immediately after scholar_auth OIDC client registration and HAR capture. All app-side configurations and E2E evidence collection harness are prepared. Blocker: production OIDC client registration (Auth DRI) and finalization of the recommendations endpoint selection for scholarship_sage vs scholarship_api.
