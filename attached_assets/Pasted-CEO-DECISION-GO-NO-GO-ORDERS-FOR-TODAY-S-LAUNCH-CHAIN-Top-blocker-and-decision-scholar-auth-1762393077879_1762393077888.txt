CEO DECISION: GO/NO-GO + ORDERS FOR TODAY’S LAUNCH CHAIN

Top blocker and decision

scholar_auth is the single-point blocker. Execute a manual cold restart now. DRI must reply “restarted” within 5 minutes and publish CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md within +5 minutes.
Acceptance criteria after restart:
authorize endpoint renders for three clients: provider-register, student-pilot, scholarship-agent (no invalid_client)
camelCase client registry active (clientId, redirectUris, grantTypes present)
token mint, refresh, and revocation verified end-to-end
15-minute soak: zero invalid_client, zero 5xx
Critical path timeline (UTC)

05:05–05:10: scholar_auth restart and smoke verify
05:15: CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md posted (auth)
05:25: ORDER_B_EVIDENCE.md posted (provider_register)
05:45–06:05: ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md posted (scholarship_api)
05:46–05:47: auto_page_maker generates +2 pages
05:55: auto_page_maker evidence posted
16:00: Infra secrets deadline for auto_com_center (auto-escalate at 16:01)
21:00: auto_com_center STAGING_VALIDATION.md posted
App-by-app status and orders

scholar_auth — NO-GO until restart completes
Order: Perform manual cold restart now; then publish:
CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md (client list, camelCase/ snake_case parity)
AUTH_SOAK.md (15-min soak, zero invalid_client, refresh + revocation proof)
Fallback at 05:12: If restart fails or soak fails, deploy fresh staging IdP (Option C) and circulate new issuer URL to all apps immediately.
2. provider_register — READY, gated by auth

Order B: Execute within 10 minutes of CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md.
Evidence (by 05:25):
Successful PKCE S256 flow (screenshots)
JWT roles=[“Provider”]
Scholarship CRUD against scholarship_api
≥20 requests with P95 ≤120ms and trace links
Security headers proof
3. scholarship_api — READY, contingent on Order B

Slot: 05:45–06:05
Evidence (ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md):
Endpoint inventory + Swagger link
Token validation vs scholar_auth
RBAC proof, ACID transaction proof
P95 reads ≤120ms, writes ≤150ms, error <0.1%
Event emission to auto_page_maker and auto_com_center
request_id → Sentry trace links
4. scholarship_agent — GO FOR MONITORING ONLY

Orders: Post checkpoint memos T+10/T+30/T+50 with SLO proofs; no auto-apply, no notifications until comms gates pass.
5. scholarship_sage — READY

Orders: Start 48h observe-only baseline upon M2M secret rotation. Deliver baseline_metrics_evidence.md at +48h (precision@5, coverage, matchReasons, fairness, SLO proofs, request_id traces).
6. student_pilot — READY, gated by auth

Orders: Execute full 95-step E2E within 10 minutes of auth evidence.
Deliver E2E_JOURNEY_EVIDENCE.md with 25+ screenshots, 9 P95 metrics, cross-browser pass, request_id traces, activation metric confirmation.
7. auto_page_maker — GO AND ARMED

Orders: On scholarship_api Order 4 event, generate +2 pages within 60 seconds.
Evidence: ORDER_4_EVIDENCE.md (sitemap diff, IndexNow receipts, CWV p75 green, P95 proof, request_id traces, rollback guard confirmation).
8. auto_com_center — STAGING GO upon secrets; PRODUCTION LOCKED

APP_NAME: Auto Command Center (auto_com_center)
APP_BASE_URL (Staging): https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
APP_BASE_URL (Prod): https://auto-com-center.scholaraiadvisor.com
Secrets deadline: 16:00 UTC (SENTRY_DSN, SQS/DLQ, Postmark, Twilio creds + A2P brand/campaign, DNS/SPF/DKIM/DMARC). Auto-escalate 16:01 if any missing.
If A2P pending: run email-only via Postmark; SMS disabled.
Deliver STAGING_VALIDATION.md by 21:00 with:
Unsubscribe <5s under load, DLQ=0, SPF/DKIM/DMARC green
P95 ≤120ms E2E, error <0.1%, uptime ≥99.9%
Compliance logs (CAN-SPAM/TCPA/FERPA/COPPA), PII redaction, rate limits
Prometheus snapshots, cross-app request_id, Sentry correlation
Security, risk, and release gates (no exceptions)

Auth: 24h soak prior to production lift; zero invalid_client; refresh + revocation verified.
API: ACID + P95 ≤120ms, Swagger public.
Comms: Unsubscribe <5s, DLQ=0, DNS green, A2P approved (email-only permissible until A2P).
Tracing: request_id propagation across all 8 apps with Sentry correlation.
Responsible AI: Bias/fairness telemetry, transparent explanations, no academic dishonesty enablement.
ARR alignment and KPIs

ARR ignition still Nov 12; earliest prod ramp Nov 9 at 1% if all gates evidenced.
KPIs to post EOD:
B2C: activation rate (first doc upload), free→paid conversion readiness checkpoints
B2B: provider activation (first scholarship published), time-to-first-applicant
CAC: organic traffic delta from +2 pages; IndexNow receipts; CWV p75
SLOs: P95s per app, error rates, uptime, unsubscribe latency, DLQ
Immediate actions required (owners)

Auth DRI: Perform cold restart now; respond “restarted” and publish CLIENT_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT.md within 10 minutes total.
Infra DRI: Deliver all auto_com_center secrets by 16:00; confirm DNS/SPF/DKIM/DMARC green.
App DRIs: Execute in sequence per timeline; publish evidence bundles to the specified paths with request_id-linked proofs.
This plan is approved. Execute with urgency. Production remains locked until all release gates are evidenced.
