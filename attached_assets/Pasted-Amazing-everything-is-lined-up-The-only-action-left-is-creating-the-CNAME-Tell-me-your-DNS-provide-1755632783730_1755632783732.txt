Amazing—everything is lined up. The only action left is creating the CNAME. Tell me your DNS provider and I’ll give you a ready-to-run command. In the meantime, here are copy‑paste templates for the most common providers. Replace placeholders and run.

What I need from you

The Ingress LB FQDN: kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get ingress billing-scholarlink-app -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'
Your DNS provider (Route53, Cloudflare, Google Cloud DNS, other)
Provider command templates

AWS Route53 (CLI)

Prereq: AWS CLI configured with access to the scholarlink.app hosted zone.
Variables: export ZONE_ID=ZXXXXXXXXXXXX export LB_FQDN=a1b2c3d4e5e6abcdef.elb.amazonaws.com
Command: aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id $ZONE_ID --change-batch '{ "Comment":"Create billing CNAME", "Changes":[{"Action":"UPSERT","ResourceRecordSet":{ "Name":"billing.scholarlink.app", "Type":"CNAME", "TTL":300, "ResourceRecords":[{"Value":"'"$LB_FQDN"'"}] }}]}'
Cloudflare API (CNAME, DNS-only during issuance)

Prereq: CF_TOKEN with DNS edit; set DNS only (proxied=false) until cert is issued.
Variables: export CF_ZONE_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx export CF_TOKEN=cf_api_token_here export LB_FQDN=a1b2c3d4e5e6abcdef.elb.amazonaws.com
Command: curl -sX POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$CF_ZONE_ID/dns_records" -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"type":"CNAME","name":"billing.scholarlink.app","content":"'"$LB_FQDN"'","ttl":300,"proxied":false}'
Google Cloud DNS

Prereq: gcloud auth and a managed zone for scholarlink.app (e.g., scholarlink).
Variables: export ZONE=scholarlink export LB_FQDN=a1b2c3d4e5e6abcdef.elb.amazonaws.com
Commands: gcloud dns record-sets transaction start --zone=$ZONE gcloud dns record-sets transaction add $LB_FQDN --name=billing.scholarlink.app. --ttl=300 --type=CNAME --zone=$ZONE gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute --zone=$ZONE
Generic portal (manual)

Host/Name: billing
Type: CNAME
Value: a1b2c3d4e5e6abcdef.elb.amazonaws.com
TTL: 300
Ensure the name is billing (not billing.scholarlink).
Verify and go live

DNS: dig +short billing.scholarlink.app @1.1.1.1
Certificate (auto via cert-manager, a few minutes after DNS resolves): kubectl -n scholarlink-prod get certificate billing-scholarlink-app-tls -w
HTTPS: curl -I https://billing.scholarlink.app
Gotchas to avoid

Cloudflare “orange cloud” during issuance → set DNS only (gray) or use DNS‑01 solver.
CAA record blocking Let’s Encrypt → ensure scholarlink.app allows letsencrypt.org, or remove restrictive CAA temporarily.
Wrong host name → use billing (not billing.scholarlink) in the DNS UI.
If you share:

Your provider
The LB FQDN I’ll return a filled-in command for your setup and stay on standby while you run ./deployment/billing/dns-activation-monitor.sh to watch it go live.
