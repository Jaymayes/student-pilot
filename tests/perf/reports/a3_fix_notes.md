# A3 Fix Notes

**Protocol:** AGENT3_HANDSHAKE v27  
**Phase:** 5 - A3 Readiness  
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-09T18:32:00Z  
**Target:** A3 Readiness 100%

---

## Current A3 Status

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Health Endpoint | 200 OK | ✅ PASS |
| Response Time | 134ms | ⚠️ Over 120ms target |
| Uptime | 99.9%+ | ✅ PASS |
| Orchestration | External | ⏸️ Cannot verify from A5 |

## Health Check Evidence

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-09T09:31:17.406Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production",
  "uptime": 9858.627539451,
  "checks": {
    "application": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Application is running",
      "lastChecked": "2026-01-09T09:31:17.406Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## Readiness Assessment

### What's Working

1. **Health Endpoint** - Returns 200 OK with detailed status
2. **Application Status** - Healthy and running
3. **Uptime** - 9858+ seconds continuous operation
4. **A8 Integration** - Heartbeat telemetry visible

### What Needs External Coordination

1. **Orchestration Runs** - A3 autonomous runs require A3 team coordination
2. **run_progress Signal** - Cannot verify from A5 without A3 access
3. **Attribution Mapping** - Requires A3 /api/attribution access
4. **Lead Elevation** - /api/leads/won-deal endpoint exists but needs verification

---

## Integration Points with A5

| Endpoint | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| /health | Health monitoring | ✅ Verified |
| /api/leads/won-deal | Learning loop lead elevation | ✅ Wired in learningLoop.ts |
| /api/attribution | UTM attribution | ⏸️ External |

## Resiliency Test Status

**CEO Approved:** HITL-A3-503-v27-2026-01-09-CEO

**Guardrails:**
- Observation-only mode
- ≤1 RPS synthetic canary
- Abort if error rate >1% for 3 minutes
- Abort if P95 >200ms for 3 minutes

**Status:** ⏸️ **PENDING A3 STAGING ACCESS**

Per CEO directive, prefer staging for active fault-injection. Production remains observation-only.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Latency Optimization**
   - Current: 134ms
   - Target: ≤120ms
   - Fix: Connection pooling, async prefetch

2. **Orchestration Verification**
   - Coordinate with AITeam for run_progress signal visibility
   - Ensure A8 receives orchestration events within 60s

3. **Staging Environment**
   - If staging URL becomes available, redirect fault-injection there
   - Keep production in observation-only mode

---

## Verdict

**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL PASS**

- Health: ✅ 100% (200 OK)
- Latency: ⚠️ 134ms (over 120ms target)
- Orchestration: ⏸️ External verification required
- Resiliency Test: ⏸️ Pending staging access
