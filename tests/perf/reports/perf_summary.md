## Optimization Recommendations

### Priority 1 (>50ms over target)

1. **A5 (Student Pilot)** - 201ms
   - Issue: Session middleware and auth checks adding latency
   - Fix: Implement session caching, reduce middleware chain
   - Owner: ProductTeam

2. **A2 (Scholarship API)** - 186ms
   - Issue: Database query latency
   - Fix: Add query result caching, optimize indexes
   - Owner: DataTeam

3. **A7 (Auto Page Maker)** - 187ms
   - Issue: Dynamic page generation overhead
   - Fix: Implement edge caching for static content
   - Owner: GrowthTeam

### Priority 2 (10-50ms over target)

4. **A3 (Scholarship Agent)** - 134ms
   - Issue: External service orchestration latency
   - Fix: Connection pooling, async prefetch
   - Owner: AITeam

5. **A8 (Auto Com Center)** - 133ms
   - Issue: Event processing overhead
   - Fix: Batch event aggregation, caching
   - Owner: Platform

## Cold Start Analysis

| App | Warm Latency | Cold Start | Warmer Status |
|-----|--------------|------------|---------------|
| A1 | 99ms | ~500ms | Not implemented |
| A2 | 186ms | ~800ms | Not implemented |
| A3 | 134ms | ~600ms | Not implemented |
| A5 | 201ms | ~1000ms | Not implemented |
| A7 | 187ms | ~700ms | Not implemented |
| A8 | 133ms | ~500ms | Not implemented |

**Recommendation:** Implement warmers for all apps to reduce cold start latency.

---

## Verdict

**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL PASS**

- 1/6 measured apps meet P95 ≤ 120ms target
- Performance optimization required for 5 apps
- A4 and A6 cannot be measured (external, 404)

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement warmers for cold start mitigation
2. Add connection pooling to reduce overhead
3. Implement response caching where appropriate
4. Re-measure after optimizations
