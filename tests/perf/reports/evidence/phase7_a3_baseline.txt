Captured: 2026-01-09T06:10:02Z
HITL Approval: HITL-A3-503-v27-2026-01-09-CEO

=== A3 STAGING BASELINE ===

Endpoint: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

--- Health Endpoint ---
URL: /api/health
Status: 200 OK
Latency: 208ms
Response: {"status":"ok","app":"scholarship_agent","baseUrl":"https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app","version":"1.0.0","uptime_s":84200}

--- Chaos Endpoint ---
URL: /chaos/503
Status: 200 (SPA fallback, no chaos endpoint available)
Note: A3 does not expose a chaos testing endpoint

--- Ready Endpoint ---
URL: /api/ready
Status: 404 (not implemented)

=== BASELINE SUMMARY ===
A3 Current State: HEALTHY
A3 Uptime: 84,200 seconds (~23.4 hours)
A3 Version: 1.0.0
Chaos Testing: NOT AVAILABLE via A3 endpoint

=== RESILIENCY TEST APPROACH ===
Since A3 does not expose a /chaos/503 endpoint, resiliency testing will:
1. Validate A5's circuit breaker implementation (code review)
2. Execute simulated 503 responses via A5 test harness
3. Document expected behavior based on implementation
4. Log HITL approval and scope constraints

=== DUAL-SOURCE EVIDENCE ===
Source 1: This HTTP probe result
Source 2: A5 circuit breaker code review (server/reliability/circuitBreaker.ts)
