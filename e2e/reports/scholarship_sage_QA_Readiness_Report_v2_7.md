## Endpoints Tested

| Endpoint | Method | Expected | Actual | Status |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| / (root) | GET | 200 | 200 ✅ | ✅ PASS |
| /canary | GET | 200 + v2.7 JSON | ⏸️ Re-validate | ⏸️ PENDING |
| /dashboards/kpis | GET | 200 + KPIs | ⏸️ Re-validate | ⏸️ PENDING |
| /events | POST | 202 ingestion | ⏸️ Re-validate | ⏸️ PENDING |

## Performance Metrics (Previous Observations)

**Note**: Per earlier testing, scholarship_sage showed 10-second latency (10,078ms), which is 84x over SLO. However, the unified prompt indicates v2.7 compliance. This needs re-validation.

| Endpoint | P50 | P95 | P99 | Target | Status |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|--------|--------|
| / (root) | TBD | TBD | TBD | ≤120ms | ⏸️ RE-VALIDATE |
| /canary | TBD | TBD | TBD | ≤120ms | ⏸️ RE-VALIDATE |

**Action Required**: Run fresh 30-sample latency measurement to confirm current state

---

## Security Headers

**Status**: ⏸️ **RE-VALIDATE**

**Expected**: 6/6 headers present (per v2.7 reference status)

---

## Canary v2.7 Validation

**Status**: ⏸️ **PENDING RE-VALIDATION**

**Expected Response** (should already be compliant):
```json
{
  "app": "scholarship_sage",
  "app_base_url": "https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app",
  "version": "v2.7",
  "status": "ok",
  "p95_ms": 120,
  "security_headers": {
    "present": ["Strict-Transport-Security", "CSP", "X-Frame-Options", "X-Content-Type-Options", "Referrer-Policy", "Permissions-Policy"],
    "missing": []
  },
  "dependencies_ok": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-31T22:55:00Z"
}
```

## Integration Checks

### student_pilot Event Ingestion
**Status**: ⏸️ **RE-VALIDATE**

**Test**: student_pilot sends events (signup, search, checkout) → scholarship_sage /events → Ingested

### KPI Dashboard
**Status**: ⏸️ **RE-VALIDATE**

**Test**: GET /dashboards/kpis returns:
- Daily MAU
- B2C conversions (free → paid)
- ARPU (average revenue per user)
- Active providers count
- 3% fee revenue

## Acceptance Criteria Results

| Criterion | Expected (v2.7 ref) | Status |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| /canary v2.7 JSON | ✅ Should be compliant | ⏸️ RE-VALIDATE |
| Headers 6/6 | ✅ Should be compliant | ⏸️ RE-VALIDATE |
| P95 ≤120ms | ✅ Should be compliant | ⚠️ **CONFLICT** (previous 10s observed) |
| Events ingestion | ✅ Should work | ⏸️ RE-VALIDATE |
| KPI dashboard | ✅ Should work | ⏸️ RE-VALIDATE |

## Known Issues Summary

### ⚠️ Conflicting Evidence

**ISSUE-001**: Latency Discrepancy  
**Previous Observation**: 10,078ms (84x over SLO)  
**Unified Prompt Claims**: v2.7 compliant and GREEN  
**Resolution Needed**: Fresh 30-sample measurement to determine ground truth

**Potential Causes of Previous Slow Response**:
1. Cold start issue (first request slow, subsequent fast)
2. Database query optimization since earlier testing
3. Caching implemented
4. Different endpoints tested

## Revenue Impact

**Blocks B2C?** ❌ No (non-blocking for first dollar)  
**Blocks B2B?** ❌ No  
**Blocks SEO?** ❌ No  
**Blocks Production?** ❌ No (analytics nice-to-have)

**Note**: This app supports monitoring and insights but is not on the critical path for revenue generation.

## Recommended Actions

### Option A: Trust v2.7 Reference Status (Per Prompt)
**Approach**: Accept that scholarship_sage is GREEN  
**Risk**: If latency issue persists, will impact analytics UX  
**Timeline**: Immediate (T+0)

### Option B: Re-validate with 30-Sample Test (Recommended)
**Approach**: Run fresh performance test to confirm  
**Risk**: May reveal issues that need fixing  
**Timeline**: T+0.5 hour for measurement

**Recommendation**: **Option B** - Quick re-validation to resolve conflicting evidence
