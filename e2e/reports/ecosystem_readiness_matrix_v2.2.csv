student_pilot,fail,2,205,pass,Missing /pricing route (protocol-mandated blocker),0.08,"2/5 per v2.2 protocol: Missing /pricing route caps score despite 100% functional readiness. Actual implementation uses /billing (fully operational with all pricing content). OIDC architecture eliminates /login and /signup as standalone pages (by design). No standalone /matches page (integrated into /scholarships). Security headers 6/6 pass. P95 TTFB 205ms (dev env; production CDN expected to reduce to <120ms). Zero console errors. All features operational. Stripe test mode verified. Quick fix: add route alias /pricing→/billing (5 min) increases score to 4/5-5/5 and unblocks T+48h Revenue Gate and T+72h Ecosystem Gate. Functional capability: 5/5. Protocol compliance: 2/5. Recommendation: Apply P0-001 immediately."
