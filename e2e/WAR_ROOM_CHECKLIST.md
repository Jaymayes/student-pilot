## P0 Gate: scholar_auth GREEN TAG

**Owner:** Auth DRI  
**Deadline:** Nov 8, 00:00 UTC (HARD STOP)

### Track 1: M2M Bypass (Immediate Unblock)
**Deadline:** 18:40 UTC (within 2 hours from 16:40 UTC)

- ☐ Configure scholarship_sage to bypass discovery, call token endpoint directly
- ☐ Configure scholarship_agent to bypass discovery (if M2M required)
- ☐ Configure scholarship_api M2M clients (if applicable)
- ☐ Test M2M token issuance end-to-end

- ☐ Test discovery endpoint with instrumentation
- ☐ Verify middleware execution order

#### Mounting Order Fix

- ☐ Confirm custom middleware first: `app.use(ourDiscoveryMiddleware)`
- ☐ Confirm provider mount after: `app.use(provider.app.callback())`
- ☐ Test discovery JSON includes client_credentials

#### Version Testing
- ☐ Test against oidc-provider 9.4.x (previous minor)
- ☐ Test against oidc-provider 9.6.x (next minor, if available)
- ☐ Compare discovery JSON behavior across versions
- ☐ Document any 9.5.1-specific regression

**Status:** ☐ IN PROGRESS ☐ COMPLETE ☐ BLOCKED

---

### SME Escalation
**Deadline:** SME confirmed by 17:40 UTC; pair-debug within 6 hours

- ☐ Prepare minimal reproducible snippet
- ☐ Document current mount strategy
- ☐ Collect relevant logs
- ☐ Engage oidc-provider SME
- ☐ Schedule pair-debug session
- ☐ Execute pair-debug

### AUTH GREEN TAG Evidence Package
**Deadline:** Nov 8, 00:00 UTC

**Required Artifacts:**

  - `client_credentials`
  - `refresh_token`
- ☐ Discovery endpoint URL: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/.well-known/openid-configuration
- ☐ Timestamp of verification

#### 2. PKCE S256 Validation
- ☐ student_pilot PKCE flow: End-to-end auth successful
- ☐ provider_register PKCE flow: End-to-end auth successful
- ☐ Code verifier → code challenge → token exchange verified
- ☐ request_id traces for both flows

#### 3. M2M Token Validation
- ☐ scholarship_sage: client_credentials token obtained
- ☐ scholarship_agent: client_credentials token obtained (if required)
- ☐ Token introspection successful
- ☐ request_id traces for M2M flows

#### 4. Token Lifecycle
- ☐ Token mint: Successful
- ☐ Token refresh: Successful
- ☐ Token revoke: Successful
- ☐ Session expiry: Verified (tokens expire as configured)

#### 5. JWKS Rotation
- ☐ JWKS endpoint serving keys
- ☐ Key rotation tested (new kid accepted)
- ☐ Old keys phased out gracefully

#### 6. Protected Route Redirects
- ☐ student_pilot: Unauthenticated access redirects to auth
- ☐ provider_register: Unauthenticated access redirects to auth
- ☐ scholarship_agent: Protected endpoints enforce auth

#### 7. Change Documentation
- ☐ Before/after code diff
- ☐ Timestamps of changes
- ☐ Rollback plan documented

## War-Room Operating Principles

1. **Evidence-First:** No status update without supporting evidence
2. **Timeboxing:** Respect all deadlines; escalate early if slipping
3. **Clear Communication:** Use templates; avoid ambiguity
4. **Stop-the-Line Authority:** Any DRI can halt if SLOs/safety thresholds breached
5. **Freeze Discipline:** No unapproved changes to frozen apps
6. **Security Priority:** No plaintext secrets; immediate rotation on exposure

---

- ☐ OIDC discovery advertises client_credentials
- ☐ PKCE S256 works for student_pilot and provider_register
- ☐ M2M tokens work for scholarship_sage (and scholarship_agent if required)
- ☐ Token lifecycle complete (mint, refresh, revoke)
- ☐ JWKS rotation proven
- ☐ Protected route redirects functional
- ☐ Evidence package complete with request_id traces
- ☐ Security review sign-off
