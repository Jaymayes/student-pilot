## Readiness Verdict

### 🟡 CONDITIONAL - Critical Blockers Identified

The Scholar Ecosystem (A1-A8) is **partially operational** but **not fully autonomous**. One service is completely down (A6), revenue telemetry shows $0, and the B2B pathway is blocked.

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Liveness | ⚠️ Partial | 6/7 services responding; A6 DOWN |
| Autonomy | ❌ Not Achieved | Revenue blocked; human intervention required |
| Interoperability | ⚠️ Partial | A5↔A8 working; A6 isolated |
| Error-Correction | ✅ Framework Ready | Feature flags, fallbacks implemented |
| Human-in-Loop | ✅ Active | Approval gates enforced |
| A8 Reporting | ⚠️ Degraded | Events persisting; Finance Tile = $0 |

| Performance (SLOs) | 10 | 7 | ⚠️ |
| Cost/Scalability | 5 | 4 | ✅ |
| Human-in-Loop Controls | 5 | 5 | ✅ |

## Critical Issues (P0/P1)

### P0: A6 Provider Register - Complete Service Failure
- **Impact:** B2B revenue pathway 100% blocked
- **Evidence:** 500 Internal Server Error on all endpoints
- **Root Cause:** Suspected database/env configuration failure
- **Owner:** TBD (requires access to A6 logs)
- **ETA:** 4 hours after diagnosis

### P1: Revenue Funnel = $0
- **Impact:** No revenue visibility in Command Center
- **Evidence:** A8 Finance Tile empty; A3 reports REVENUE BLOCKED
- **Root Cause:** A6 down + possible A8 scope limitations
- **Owner:** Revenue Team + A8 Team
- **ETA:** Dependent on A6 fix

### P1: A2 Missing /ready Endpoint
- **Impact:** Health monitoring unreliable
- **Evidence:** 404 on /ready; A5 shows A2 as "unhealthy"
- **Root Cause:** Endpoint not implemented (Issue A)
- **Owner:** A2 Team
- **ETA:** 1 day (PR spec exists)

## E2E Workflow Pass/Fail Matrix

| Workflow | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Marketing (A7) | ✅ PASS | SEO operational |
| Lead Gen (A3) | ✅ PASS | Lead scoring active |
| B2C Revenue (A5) | ✅ PASS | Stripe live mode |
| B2B Revenue (A6) | ❌ FAIL | Service down |
| Learning (A2) | ⚠️ DEGRADED | Missing /ready |
| Telemetry (A8) | ✅ PASS | Events persisting |
| Auth (A1) | ✅ PASS | OIDC discovery OK |

**Overall: 71.4% Pass Rate (5/7)**

---

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **[HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED]** Access A6 production logs to diagnose 500 error
2. **[HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED]** Fix A6 configuration (env vars, database)
3. Implement A2 /ready endpoint (PR spec ready)
4. Investigate A1 session expiry reports
5. Verify A8 write permissions for revenue events

---

## Risk Summary

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|----------|------------|-------|
| B2B Revenue Loss | Critical | Fix A6 immediately | Ops |
| Revenue Blindness | High | Unblock A3→A8 flow | Revenue Team |
| Auth Token Issues | Medium | Verify client_id/redirect | Auth Team |
| Monitoring Gaps | Medium | Add A2 /ready endpoint | A2 Team |

---

## Learning Log

### Hypotheses Tested
1. ❌ "A2 is unhealthy" → Actually healthy, but /ready missing
2. ✅ "A6 is completely down" → Confirmed, 500 on all endpoints
3. ⚠️ "OIDC is broken" → Discovery works; session errors need investigation
4. ✅ "A8 accepts events" → Confirmed via test probe

### Corrections Applied
- A5 fallback from /ready to /health for A2 → Working
- Telemetry buffering on A8 failure → Implemented
- Feature flags for instant rollback → Ready

## Recommendation

**Do not proceed to full production deployment** until:
1. A6 is restored and B2B pathway verified
2. Revenue events confirmed flowing to A8
3. A2 /ready endpoint implemented

Current state supports **A5 B2C operations only** with known limitations.
