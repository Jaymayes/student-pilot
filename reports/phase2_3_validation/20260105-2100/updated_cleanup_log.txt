CLEANUP LOG: Simulated Audit Namespace
Date: 2026-01-05T21:22:00Z
===============================================

NAMESPACE: simulated_audit

--- Pre-Cleanup Check ---
Checking for simulated_audit data in A5 local database...

Query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE namespace = 'simulated_audit';
Result: 0 rows (no local test data)

Query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments WHERE namespace = 'simulated_audit';
Result: 0 rows (no test payments)

--- A8 Test Event ---
One validation test event was sent to A8:
  event_id: evt_1767648133956_8zeh9w3iu
  namespace: simulated_audit
  type: validation_test

This event is properly tagged with simulated_audit namespace
and will be filtered out when Demo Mode is OFF in A8.

--- Cleanup Actions ---
1. No local A5 cleanup required (no test data created)
2. A8 test event is namespace-tagged (auto-filtered)
3. No database mutations were performed

--- Verification ---
✅ A5 local database: Clean
✅ A8 events: Properly namespaced
✅ No production data affected

--- Cleanup Script Reference ---
