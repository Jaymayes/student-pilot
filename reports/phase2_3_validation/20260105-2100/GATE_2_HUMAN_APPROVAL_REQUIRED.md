## Production Readiness Checklist

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| A5 SLO targets met | ✅ P95 6.95ms < 150ms |
| Feature flags configured | ✅ All behind flags |
| Rollback procedures documented | ✅ `rollback_readiness.md` |
| No hard-coded secrets | ✅ Verified |
| Telemetry operational | ✅ Verified |
| External dependencies healthy | ✅ 8/8 apps |
| Security headers configured | ✅ Verified |
| Error handling robust | ✅ Graceful degradation |

---

## Requesting Human Approval For

### 1. A5 Production Deployment
Deploy student_pilot (A5) with the new external health client and enhanced readiness endpoint.

**Risk:** LOW - A5 changes are additive (new health checks) with graceful degradation.

### 2. External PR Submission (Requires Repo Access)
Submit PRs for Issues A-D to A2, A7, A8 repositories.

**Risk:** MEDIUM - Requires coordination with external teams.

### 3. Production Monitoring Activation
Enable production alerting based on `monitoring_rule_changes.md`.

**Risk:** LOW - Conservative thresholds, feature flags default OFF.

---

## What Remains Blocked Until Approval

1. ❌ A5 production deployment (Replit publish)
2. ❌ External repository PR creation (A2, A7, A8)
3. ❌ Production configuration changes
4. ❌ Database schema migrations
5. ❌ External service configuration

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise post-deployment:

1. **Immediate (< 1 minute):** Toggle feature flags OFF
2. **Short-term (< 5 minutes):** Revert to previous checkpoint
3. **Recovery:** All changes are additive; no destructive operations

See `rollback_readiness.md` for detailed procedures.

## Artifacts for Review

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `validation_report.md` | Executive summary of all validation |
| `latency_profiles/comparison.csv` | Before/after latency comparison |
| `e2e_results/e2e_results_after.json` | E2E test results |
| `e2e_results/a8_validation_after.json` | Telemetry verification |
| `baseline_slo_snapshot.json` | Phase 1 baseline metrics |
| `port_bindings_report_after.md` | Port conflict check |

---

## Approval Request

**To proceed with production deployment, please confirm:**

- [ ] Reviewed validation report and metrics
- [ ] Accepted rollback plan
- [ ] Authorized A5 production deployment
- [ ] Authorized external PR submissions (if repo access available)

---

## Stop Conditions (Safety)

This gate was raised because:
- Production mutation would occur (deployment)
- External repository changes would be submitted
- This marks the boundary between staging validation and production

---

## Expected Outcome Post-Approval

1. A5 deploys to production with enhanced health monitoring
2. PR specs shared with A2/A7/A8 teams for implementation
3. Monitoring alerts activated in production
4. Command Center (A8) receives production telemetry

**Gate 2 Status:** ⏳ PENDING (User did not respond - awaiting explicit approval for production)

To approve, respond with confirmation or click "Deploy" in Replit.
