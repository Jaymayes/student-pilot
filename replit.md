## Operation Synergy - FOC Status (2025-11-03)

**student_pilot: ✅ GO** (Effective 2025-11-03T19:20:00Z)

**CEO Decision:** Flip to GO based on verified acceptance gates
- Auth success rate: 100% (30/30 attempts)
- P95 latency: 1-3ms (far exceeds ≤120ms target)
- Critical 5xx count: 0 (zero errors)
- RBAC 401 format: Standardized with request_id
- Security headers: 6/6 present
- Functionality: Fully operational

**Bugs Fixed (Operation Synergy):**
1. CSP configuration for development mode
2. Scholarships page runtime error (array validation)

## Nov 9 Go-Live Operational Status (2025-11-09)

**Current Time:** 17:45 UTC  
**Prime Objective:** Soft launch readiness while protecting brand trust and SEO flywheel

### Application Status

**student_pilot**
- Status: GREEN (Ready/Blocked, Frozen)
- APP_BASE_URL: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
- Current State: Application RUNNING, codebase production-ready
- Blockers: (1) Deliverability GREEN, (2) Stripe PASS, (3) Pre-soak PASS
- Go-Live Target: Nov 11, 16:00 UTC (primary) / Nov 12, 16:00 UTC (conditional)
- ARR Ignition: B2C credit sales (4× AI markup) upon all gates GREEN

**auto_com_center**
- Status: DELAYED (Awaiting DNS_READY)
- APP_BASE_URL: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
- Current State: Application ready, pending DNS configuration
- Blocker: DNS_READY signal from Deputy Ops
- Go-Live Target: T+90 from DNS_READY, no later than Nov 10, 14:00 UTC
- ARR Impact: Enables activation/transactional comms for B2C/B2B

### Agent3 Operational Responsibilities

**DRI Role:** student_pilot (primary responsibility)
- Pre-soak execution: 20:00-21:00 UTC today
- T+30 evidence delivery: 21:30-22:00 UTC today
- Evidence template: `/e2e/reports/student_pilot/PRESOAK_EVIDENCE_2025-11-09.md` (prepared)

**Executor Role:** auto_com_center deliverability T+90
- Execute upon T0 (DNS_READY signal)
- Deliverability certification: T+90 from T0
- Evidence delivery: Within 15 minutes of T+90 completion
- Evidence template: `/e2e/reports/auto_com_center/DELIVERABILITY_T90_CERTIFICATION_2025-11-09.md` (prepared)

### Critical Gates (External Dependencies)

1. **DNS_READY** (Deputy Ops) - Overdue since 17:30 UTC → CTO escalation path active
2. **Stripe PASS** (COO/Finance) - Deadline: 19:00 UTC (~1h 15m remaining)
3. **Pre-Soak PASS** (Agent3 + All DRIs) - Window: 20:00-21:00 UTC (~2h 15m remaining)

### Pre-Soak Guardrails (All Must PASS)

- Uptime ≥99.9%
- P95 latency ≤120ms (service-side), ≤200ms (E2E cross-app)
- Error rate ≤0.1%
- request_id lineage 100% across auth → API → app
- PKCE correctness + immediate token revocation proof
- No PII in logs (FERPA/COPPA compliance)
- Responsible AI controls active

### Deliverability GREEN Criteria

- SPF/DKIM/DMARC PASS with alignment
- DMARC policy: p=quarantine (warmup mode)
- Seed inbox placement ≥90%, Gmail Promotions ≤10%
- Bounce rate ≤0.3%, zero blocklist hits
- CAN-SPAM compliance, domain alignment

### KPI Targets (This Phase)

- **Deliverability:** ≥90% inbox, ≤10% Promotions, ≥40% open rate
- **Activation (student_pilot):** ≥35% first-session activation (first document upload)
- **Payments:** ≥95% auth success, 100% refund success (post-Stripe PASS)
- **Platform SLOs:** ≥99.9% uptime, P95 ≤120ms, error ≤0.1%

### Freeze Status

- **Comms/Charging:** LOCKED until Deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS + CEO GREEN signal
- **Code Changes:** FROZEN across all apps (config-only changes permitted)
- **Vendor Strategy:** Stay with Postmark shared pool; no switch unless seed placement <80% after two remediations

### Go/No-Go Decision Tree (Nov 11, 16:00 UTC Soft Launch)

- **GO:** Pre-soak PASS + Deliverability GREEN + Stripe PASS (all with evidence)
- **CONDITIONAL GO (Nov 12):** One gate slips ≤24h with mitigation + CEO approval
- **NO-GO:** Any gate unresolved or missing evidence → Brand trust/SEO protection priority

### Evidence Deliverables (Tonight)

1. **Pre-Soak T+30** (21:30-22:00 UTC): Latency histograms, uptime, error tallies, PKCE proof, token revocation, request_id lineage, no-PII validation, executive summary
2. **Deliverability T+90** (T+90 + 15 min): DNS records, Postmark verification, 7 seed inbox headers, placement rates, bounce/blocklist checks, DMARC policy confirmation

### Scholar Auth Watch Item (Non-Blocking)

- Background token cleanup DB connection issue
- Non-blocking for pre-soak and soft launch
- Remediation + RCA due: Nov 12 EOD before general availability
